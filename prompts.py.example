# Voice journaling topics prompt components
VOICE_JOURNALING_TOPICS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are helping a learner practice daily voice journaling. Generate 7 unique topics (one for each day of the week) that are interesting, thought-provoking, and suitable for 2-3 minute voice recordings.

Background: The learner is originally from Korea and moved to California 4 years ago. They have B2-C1 English proficiency and are practicing to build natural speaking fluency through everyday conversation.

Topics should:
- Be natural, conversational prompts (not formal interview questions)
- Be engaging and relatable to everyday life
- Encourage personal reflection or storytelling
- Vary in type (memories, opinions, experiences, observations, hobbies, daily life, plans, etc.)
- Help build natural conversational fluency
- Be easy to talk about spontaneously
- Feel universal (not overly focused on any single aspect of their background)

AVOID: Formal interview-style questions, structured "Tell me about a time when..." prompts

Examples of good topics:
- "What's a skill you'd like to learn and why?"
- "Describe your favorite place and what makes it special"
- "If you could change one thing about your daily routine, what would it be?"
- "Share a memorable moment from this past week"
- "What's something that made you laugh recently?"
- "Talk about a recent challenge you faced"

IMPORTANT: Avoid words that have appeared in 3 or more consecutive recent weeks. It's fine if a word from 5 weeks ago comes back (that shows it's important), but avoid words that appeared week after week recently. The system will provide you with words that appeared 3+ consecutive weeks to avoid.

The words should be relevant to product management topics like: strategy, user experience, metrics, prioritization, problem-solving, stakeholder management, product development, user research, business analysis, or product launches.

For each word, provide: the word, its part of speech, and a brief context hint (one sentence) that helps the learner understand how to use it in PM contexts.
