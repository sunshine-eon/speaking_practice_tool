============================================================

And you do have to make sure you can keep doing it. Yeah, that's actually a great segue to where I was going to go next, which is you say you build and you like to build stuff, but you're like legitimately building a lot of stuff. So you have the site, mindofharry.com, where you share all these side projects. So can you just talk about what's going on there and some of this?

Yeah, you built, you know, I am people. The only thing I've ever been good in my life is just building things and creating things. I get a lot of energy from it. And yeah, I have a site that's called mindofharry, because it is really whatever is top of mind. I try to do my best to completely separate it from business. I know there's always a draw as a good PM to kind of say, is there a business here? But I try to keep it as art, just, you know, like it's completely art. And it's what I want to build.

I take on new subjects and I have two little kids, and you know, it's fun to kind of one of them was a book. Me and my oldest wrote, and it was kind of a set of bedtime stories we did. Then one day I was like, hey, we should just make this a notebook. And we did. I think it's got about half a million readers now. So it's been fun to kind of see it take some life and go through. We made a board game recently that I know Stanford Design School or some professors there have been using. It was called Parallel Universe, and it's how do you kind of have a card and then be able to see, like, you know, maybe the card says there's no windows in this world anymore. And then what would happen in that world? You got to list 10 different things that would happen.

So kind of that ability to think ahead and kind of fund scyphes. I make kind of healthy gummy bears. I just try to take something completely new and have that. I don't know. It's probably one of the more fun moments in this world where you can sit there and just create something and have some new clay. And yeah, that is what that website is about.

Wait, so you made actual gummy bears? Yeah, we are doing some with gummy bears. So, Lenny, I know you're expecting a new additional bit in congratulations again. Well, one of the things I found when I had kids is no matter what I was trying to do, there was like candy and sugar everywhere, like any Halloween and birthday party, etc. So I wanted to create—you can't get rid of it because, like, you know, it was just hard to do. So we were like, hey, we're going to sit down and make our own gummy bear.

What I found is this is just a fun tidbit for your readers. You open like a Twizzler, one of those about 80 percent of what's in there is sugar because they're optimizing for shelf life, right? They're optimizing what's in the store. And so what we were able to do is basically create a gummy bear, about 40 percent of its sugar. It's just got five ingredients. Honey is the sweetener because I don't want to give my kids some alternative sweeteners. But yeah, we have a small commercial kitchen and we produce some gummy bears. 

And if you ever want to try them to any of my followers, I'm happy to send some gummy bears and hopefully you can check them out. We had a question: is there a way to buy them somewhere? We can go to Mind of Hari. We stock them seasonally. And one of the things that we found out is there are different kinds of laws on how it can be shipped, and obviously we're not optimizing for long storage. So they'll be on Mind of Hari, and you can always reach out to me and I'll find you and tell you where which farmers market we're at or whatever, and you can come swing by.

Well, I don't see it on Mind of Hari. So maybe by the time this comes out, put it on here or if you're trying to put it on there. Yeah, it's under—it's on the homepage. And then when they're stuck, we put them in the shop. OK, so that means they're out of stock. All right, we're going to sell you out. Let's get all your gummy bears.
