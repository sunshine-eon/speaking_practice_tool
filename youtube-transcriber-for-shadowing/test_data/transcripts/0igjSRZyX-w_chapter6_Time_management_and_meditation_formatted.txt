============================================================

Or who does what? When we hired our initial executive teams, I followed very conventional wisdom. I ended up with a set of VPs and eight, I think, direct reports, maybe even nine. And I thought that's what you were meant to do. That's how startups are meant to scale. But as anyone who's been there knows, eight direct reports is a lot. It's a lot of hiring, it's a lot of goal setting, it's a lot of OKRs, it's a lot of accountability conversations, and fortunately, also it's a lot of firing. No CEO ever gets their executive team right on the first try. So that time I had for the things that I think I can genuinely be world-class at—things like product, design, technology, and marketing—began to rapidly disappear. As a result, the organization began to slow down.

Fortunately, I was also tracking my time very closely; I had this crazy way of tracking it. At one point, I noticed I was spending six to seven percent of my week on these areas where I can truly be world-class. So I had two realizations. Number one, as CEO, once you get to a certain scale—and we were definitely at that scale—you can actually define what you want the role of the CEO to be at your company. Number two, the superhuman opportunity deserves everyone who works at the company to spend as much time as possible in their zone of genius. That includes me as well as everybody else.

So what I did is I hired a really great president, I went from eight direct reports to two, and the amount of time that I spend on product, design, technology, and marketing went up from six to seven percent to about 60 to 70 percent of my week. Just to mirror back a few things, one is people may feel like you are not shipping as much as you used to because you're actually building things they don't care about, like support for office and all these things that they don't need, but the business needs to expand integrations with Microsoft and Android and all these things. I think that's such a good point—that it looks like nothing's happening when there's a lot of good stuff happening for other users that aren't you.

Then there's this point about people delegating and then feeling like, "This is not what I wanted, why did I do this?" You think it's going to speed up, but it slows down. A couple of threads here are really interesting. One is this time tracking thing. I need to know how you do this. The fact that you knew like seven to eight percent, or whatever the number you said, to that granularity, how do you do time tracking? Let's not go super far, but just what's your approach?

So this is a technique that I call the switch log. It's born out of the observation that your calendar says what you thought you were going to do, but it's really only your trail of work that describes what you actually did. So how can we capture that? How can we create a system of work that isn't tethered to a calendar, where you aren't at the behest of what some timetable says you do or don't have to do? I came up with the following idea: what if I just did whatever the heck I wanted? Every single time I changed tasks, I just Slack DM'd my EA. This also works in Slackbot; it just has to go somewhere. I Slack DM'd my EA and I said "TS:" followed by a few words for the task I was doing.

Well, that would create certain changes. Instead of having to constantly look at the calendar and think, "Oh, should I stop this task, start that task?" I can just do what I want. If what I feel right now is, "Oh boy, I really need to prepare for Lenny's podcast," I'll go ahead and do that. If I get bored or distracted eight minutes in, which sometimes happens because something else just bubbles up to the top of my mind, there's a reason that my body is bubbling it up. I also practice transcendental meditation, so I'm very keen on the idea of being aware and listening to what's bubbling up. It's okay for me to then go and attend to that thought instead of expending my focus points or willpower on the thing that I thought I was meant to be doing.

All I'd have to do is go back to Slack, type "TS:" and deal with this other thing. By the way, you should obviously turn up for your meetings. I'm not saying just to blow through your meetings and not turn up for your one-on-ones; definitely do those things. What I'm saying is do what feels right for as long as it feels right to do. Then at the end of the week, you can see where your time is going. I realized at one point that I was spending only about 5% of my time on recruiting, whereas perhaps I should be spending 20 or 30% or more of my time on recruiting. The biggest thing was I saw I was only spending 6 to 7% of my time on product, design, technology, and marketing—areas where I know I'm really good. I should either be teaching people how to do them or doing them, or some combination of both. That's probably the best thing for me; it keeps me really happy, very joyful, keeps me sharp, but it's also scaling the organization.

Once you have this Slack log, you can then graph it and chart it to see where your time is actually going. How cool! Clearly, this is an app opportunity or an agent opportunity where you're just telling this thing every time. It's essentially tracking context switches, which we're always hearing to try to avoid. 

Yeah, I think context switches are fine. There's definitely this idea that for every interruption you have, the brain does take roughly 21 minutes on average to recover and get back to the efficacy you had before you were disturbed. It's a big deal; of course, I'm building productivity software. We design Superhuman to minimize the amount of distraction and disruption that's possible within the app. But if you're working on something and at the back of your mind, something bubbles up, you have to attend to it in one way or the other. Sometimes I just write it down. I have a gigantic sketchbook, twice the size of A4, I guess A3, and I always have a 4H pencil. Whenever one of those thoughts comes up, I just scribble it down or I actually stop what I'm doing and attend to that task. There's a reason it's bubbling up right now.

I love that you know the type of paper and pencil—A3 paper and a 4H pencil. This is going to be a theme. You mentioned meditation; you said you do TM. So you do 20 minutes in the morning and 20 minutes in the afternoon, or do you do a longer session? 

I do about half an hour in the morning, including rest time. The physical rest component is very important to me. It's 20 minutes of actual meditation and then 10 minutes of rest. I do that in the morning as well as in the afternoon at around 3 PM. 

And you just carve that out in your calendar? Everyone knows Rahul at three o'clock is going to be out? 

Absolutely. My EA knows; they're the one organizing the calendar and making sure things happen when they need to happen. They also know that nothing can override this TM block. Without it, I genuinely start to fall apart. But with it, I'm able to access some very deep competencies that I didn't have before. I've been doing this now for about four or five years. Initially, I simply felt happier, occasionally even euphoric, coming out of a really great meditation session. Over time, I found that my ability to focus was increasing; I could hold attention on something for much longer. I also became much more creative and expressive. These are well-known side effects, or intended effects, for some people of TM.

Interestingly, if you compare TM to other forms of meditation, they don't have quite the same impact across as many executive functions. So there's something particularly interesting going on with transcendental meditation compared to other forms that folks are still trying to unravel and figure out. 

Folks, if they're inspired and they want to check out this form of meditation, any advice on where they could go to learn? 

Absolutely, a lot. But in summary, have a coach teach you. I had many false starts myself with meditation, trying various apps and learning from books. None of it really worked for me. What worked was having one-on-one teaching from someone who had been taught one-on-one in the yogic or Raj tradition. This person, in particular, had also been a venture-backed founder multiple times over, so they were very well aware of the kinds of stresses that I tend to be under. All of his clients are mostly in technology as well. If you're in the Bay Area, this person's name is Laurent Valasek, and they run an institution called the Peak Leadership Institute. This is all about how we can live a more integrated and whole life, integrating wellness practices like meditation, but for the purpose of unlocking peak performance in life and in business. 

Thank you for sharing that. That is very actionable. We're going to link to that in the show notes.
