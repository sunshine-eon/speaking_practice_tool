============================================================

[00:00] Absolutely. Okay. I'm going to go in a totally different direction. I want to talk about Indian CEOs in the US. Okay
[00:06] So today the CEOs of Microsoft
[00:11] alphabet
[00:12] Adobe which is a 250 billion dollar company turns out IBM, which is a hundred seventy billion dollar company
[00:18] Palo Alto Networks, which is a hundred billion dollar company even Starbucks also a hundred billion dollar company
[00:24] I was look that up and then also Twitter before Elon took over Twitter
[00:27] The CEOs of these companies were all born in India and emigrated to the US and
[00:32] I might be wrong, but I think this is the largest
[00:36] Ethnic group of CEOs of tech companies other than just white dudes in the US
[00:41] Okay
[00:41] So I'm curious why you think Indian immigrants are so successful in business and in tech in the US
[00:48] Especially in these very high positions and then is most curious just what can we learn from that?
[00:53] What can we learn from their success? It's a great question. I often often wonder about it and I have had
[00:59] Good fortune to meet a fair bunch of these individuals and had a chance to really explore with them
[01:06] What really went on so there are a few things that pop out and and again
[01:11] These are all conjectures, which I can't prove in any ways
[01:14] But it's a it's a thought experiment any ways to talk about these things first is in it in general
[01:21] immigrants
[01:22] That get out of the country are usually
[01:25] Have chip on the shoulder in a very different way and the struggle that they have to go through to just get out and be successful
[01:32] And that hunger that got them there. There was no privilege like they were we came from very very humble backgrounds and and
[01:40] Literally no money to start with so I think the the that this force is real
[01:45] Right, but I can say that for many immigrants in general as well
[01:48] But appreciation for math in general or logic which came to society in a big way, right?
[01:54] Kind of give let's say for example lots of engineering graduates come from only few countries
[01:59] Because if the society was bent towards let's say earlyness of mathematics or earlyness of this
[02:04] And I think that kind of helps create status that what will get appreciated
[02:10] For example being an engineer being a doctor like philosophy major I was a write-off for the society, right?
[02:15] So the reason I am the rare commodity over here because you are not considered to be very bright unless you break into these
[02:22] Very hard exams and very very hard thing. So the filtering criteria on its own is big
[02:28] But there's another interesting framework altogether, which I have actually learned from this gentleman. They've got but now
[02:34] He applies Indian mythology and management principles together and it's an interesting thing. So there are three major
[02:42] Indian God one is the
[02:44] Brahma the God of creation Shiva the God of destruction
[02:48] I'm super generalizing but that's the classification and and the third is like Vishnu to the God of
[02:54] Sustainance and the avatars the word avatar comes from Vishnu keep changing of that, right?
[02:59] So we have had Rama Krishna all these guys have avatars of this
[03:03] So what you notice is that?
[03:05] if you took a two-by-two of
[03:08] people who are high on values and low on values a
[03:13] High on obedience and low on obedience
[03:16] You make an interesting two-by-two, right? Now Lord Krishna, which is a one of the very popular avatars
[03:24] Which was non
[03:25] I mean food so suits the entrepreneurial category, which is high on values, but very low on obedience
[03:31] He was known to be the naughty
[03:34] God and he could actually create lots of things and there is Rama
[03:36] It is known to be the one which follows principles and obedient, right? So they will follow Dharma
[03:43] And scale on that and then there are these notorious characters is Ravana, which is low on values low on
[03:49] Obedience and there's the other now which he says that he's low or higher on obedience, but lower values, right?
[03:55] So these are the people that you don't want to be and what you notice is that a
[03:59] Lot of CEOs have done well because they follow the Dharma of the founders quite well
[04:04] like they have not diluted the Dharma of the founders who have started these companies and
[04:11] managed to sustain that
[04:13] And a lot of CEOs have this need to say oh, I'm gonna change the company forever and it will be my
[04:19] Identity and I will change the logo and I will change the name and I will do all sorts of things
[04:24] Right, but maintaining Dharma, right where I will say that these are the principles were given to me
[04:29] I'm gonna sustain this and make it even bigger
[04:31] Comes from humility of saying that there is something
[04:36] Some pure form factor and I think therefore that character stays on right and therefore that the characters of
[04:43] Brahma and Shiva are the founder of the real create and destroy like that's the thing
[04:48] But sustenance is the harder one and therefore our thoughts keep happening
[04:53] Over and over of time and and different hurdles come and different levels come
[04:56] but when you think about
[04:59] the archetype of at least the agency that I've seen that they are
[05:03] Fabulous at moving between Krishna and Rama all the time, right? They can play this
[05:09] Consistently and therefore they keep evolving and keep making these companies bigger and bigger
[05:14] And I think we will see a lot more of this in years to come because now they have the role models of these individuals
[05:20] Who have kind of done well, but the key principle is that if you ask the founders
[05:25] They will love these CEOs if they are around
[05:29] Because they maintain the Dharma of the thing and for example, let's say what Tim is doing is maintaining the Dharma of Steve Jobs
[05:36] Because if you try to change the Dharma of Steve Jobs and what the values the companies are
[05:41] It's very hard to imagine it to be sustaining itself forever and ever
[05:44] Wow, what an answer this what I love about this is this combination of using a two by two and
[05:50] Indian mythology is like the microcosm of you, which is philosophy and tech
[05:57] And so I love that and makes a lot of sense. That's where your mind goes
[06:02] Something else that makes me think about is or this book a long time ago
[06:04] Jim Collins either gets a grade or one of his early books about leadership and he talks about level 5 leadership
[06:10] I think is him and where level 5 leaders are ones where it's not about them
[06:13] It's about the business and they can disappear in the future and things will work great. Yes
[06:20] And and I feel it is very hard
[06:23] If you believe that your identity
[06:26] Needs to have its own position and legacy
[06:29] And and therefore a lot of time chasing status
[06:32] Causes disruption because you will say that oh, this doesn't have my signature in it
[06:37] And therefore becoming
[06:41] Accepting the religion and trying to be the
[06:44] The pope of it or the father of it is is better than trying to say oh
[06:48] I need to have my variant of religion. Uh, and that's where the creative destruction starts happening
[06:54] Interesting. Okay. So you said that there's this good balance between Krishna and Rama that happens
[06:58] Can you just uh, again summarize the where they are in that two by two Rama is uh high on
[07:05] values and high on obedience
[07:07] And Krishna is high on values and low on obedience, but they both are high on values, which means they will follow dharma
[07:15] And and they will change the side. For example, let's say Satya
[07:19] During the open air crisis played Krishna
[07:22] And and god things out, but he'll switch back to being Rama and continue to
[07:28] Keep scaling it up
[07:29] Amazing and just to close the loop on here
[07:30] Is your sense that they're like they're actually thinking
[07:33] About this and they're religious or is this just like in the ether of growing up in India?
[07:37] And this is just part of the culture. It's a great question
[07:40] I don't think they consciously think about it
[07:43] But I think they ever heard this
[07:45] They would agree with this because that's what they grew up with and and the value systems are
[07:50] Much more long term. For example, I believe all bad behavior in humans humans come from being short term
[07:57] Right, uh and and being long term
[08:00] Uh comes, you know, very it's a it's a big choice to make and a lot of times
[08:05] A lot of people argue that oh, we have arranged marriages and like it's 95% arranged marriages and less than 1% divorce rate
[08:13] Comes from this whole long term thinking
[08:17] Right that people are married through values
[08:21] versus attraction or
[08:24] Lust and all of that stuff but more long term oriented and about building a family building values
[08:30] Or low divorce rate and about we'll fix
[08:34] Along the way versus trying to say oh, I need to evolve and I need to move forward. So I think
[08:38] being long term
[08:40] Uh about that mindset and and that's why some cultures last for
[08:45] Thousands of years because of this need for everybody to be more long term
[08:50] versus short the us could use a lot of that in these days
