============================================================

[00:00] I think that's such an interesting insight, especially that the first thing you said around
[00:04] how the more often and the more crowded the space is, the more opportunity there is for
[00:09] design to be a differentiator, is that roughly how you think about it?
[00:13] Yeah.
[00:14] So I mean, just think about, I don't know, any product category.
[00:17] It's like, basically people have then like lower choices and then they like, how do
[00:21] they make choices?
[00:22] Like maybe there's a specific thing they want, but like a lot of people don't
[00:25] necessarily know what is the specific feature I want from this software.
[00:29] So it's more like, well, what is the best one?
[00:31] Like what is the highest quality one?
[00:34] And if you put things side by side and you just people see things, people are visual.
[00:40] So like then like the design can be one of those things is like stands out is like, well,
[00:44] that looks the best or that looks the most like quality product to me.
[00:48] So I'm going to use that one.
[00:50] Like when people have a lot of choices, they probably will pick the one that like
[00:53] looks most interesting.
[00:55] And then I think there is the second part is the brand, which is something that you if
[01:01] you can build a brand, then I think it's like, it doesn't really even the product almost
[01:06] doesn't matter.
[01:07] Like it's, it's, it becomes this kind of default like, I don't know, like again,
[01:12] like Apple or Nike is like, yeah, there's all kinds of shoes you can buy.
[01:17] But there's a reason for someone to buy Nike shoes other than some, some random brand.
[01:21] Even if the random brand would be actually a better shoe, they still buy Nike because
[01:25] they like, I don't know, like the brand.
[01:27] So then I think like both the design of the product, but also the design of the brand
[01:32] can be like, like very strong, like kind of things that like pull people to your company
[01:39] or to the product.
