============================================================

So you talked about execution and how maybe for early stage startups that might be default, the most important type of work to be focused on. That's actually a really good lead way to our fourth big idea, which is kind of a provocative tweet that you put out a while ago. You mentioned that most execution problems are actually strategy problems or culture problems. I'm excited to hear a little bit more about how you discovered that, what it means, and maybe how to address those problems.

I realized this somewhat late in my career as a leader. Most execution problems that I encounter in a high performing environment, where everybody has the right intentions, are actually not execution problems. They are either strategy problems, interpersonal problems, or cultural problems. 

To illustrate this, I'll make the observation that many leaders are extremely busy in such environments, whether it's a fast growth startup or a fast growth larger company. They're usually overwhelmed. Like I said earlier, I was one of those people. When you take a deeper look at what they're engaged in, I had the chance to observe it with my peers that I was mentoring or coaching, as well as people on my team, PMs or PM leaders who are also extremely busy and usually overwhelmed.
