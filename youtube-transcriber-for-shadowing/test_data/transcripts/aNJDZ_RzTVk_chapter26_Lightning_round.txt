Time: 70:37 - 76:56
============================================================

[00:00] Um, so I'm, because I work a lot, I try to read things that are completely outside of
[00:07] work.
[00:08] I don't think I can get through any like fiction or not fiction book that's often recommended.
[00:12] So anything that, that will pull on your heartstrings and, and, and, and try to make
[00:16] you more human, um, when breath becomes air is a really good one that, that I often
[00:21] recommend.
[00:22] Amazing.
[00:23] Love that one.
[00:24] Favorite recent movie or TV show.
[00:28] After watching the bear a few weeks ago, I think it's a, it's a great show around leadership
[00:34] around how a different industry operates restaurant industry.
[00:38] My dad owned a restaurant.
[00:39] So I got a little bit into that and all about teamwork and, and quality versus versus
[00:45] velocity of personal and professional stress.
[00:49] So I thought, that is a really good learning.
[00:51] Wow.
[00:52] That move that show makes me really think of ramp that makes a lot of sense.
[00:56] It just, it feels very, everything is just crazy.
[00:59] Moving fast.
[01:00] I'm just so stressed watching that show.
[01:02] I haven't watched the second season yet.
[01:04] You should come to our office.
[01:05] It's probably very similar.
[01:07] Just delicious food sandwiches and the velocity.
[01:11] Favorite interview question you'd like to ask candidates.
[01:15] I asked what's the hardest thing you've ever done.
[01:18] Um, and I asked that because ramp, working at ramp is hard.
[01:23] I want to understand like what hard means for them.
[01:25] I want to understand why it was hard.
[01:26] I want to understand how they overcame that difficulty, how they worked with other people
[01:30] to overcome that difficulty and, and how much agency they, they had in overcoming that.
[01:36] So it's a really, it's a really good sign around, you know, what, what is difficulty
[01:41] to them and how, how, how much work they put into overcoming that.
[01:46] What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?
[01:50] Uh, so my partner bought me this whoop, uh, recently wearing it, wearing it now gives
[01:55] you like this real time, like, uh, stress signal.
[01:58] Oh, that's pretty helpful.
[02:01] But I think, I think it's, it's, it's a great product in terms of just actual insights.
[02:06] It's very data driven.
[02:07] So it'll tell you, you'll be like a daily journal of all the things you did that
[02:10] day and it'll correlate what you did that day to your, your recovery score and how
[02:16] healthy you are for that day.
[02:18] And so it'll give you insights around, you know, how certain actions you take will have
[02:22] impact on your, on your next day's health, which is all about heart rate variability.
[02:27] That was just a great way to, you know, continue to focus on your health.
[02:31] I think running a team is, is, it has a huge impact on, on your physical health and
[02:37] your mental health.
[02:38] And I think, you know, you are an athlete at a high growth startup or even a small
[02:43] business or a large company and, uh, focusing on the health, uh, is, is really,
[02:48] really important.
[02:48] So any, any tools like the whoop to invest into that is great.
[02:53] Now those are really good pitch for the whoop.
[02:54] I have never wanted one, but now I do.
[02:57] Okay.
[02:57] Next question.
[02:58] What is something relatively minor you've changed in your product
[03:01] development process that has had a big impact on your team's ability to
[03:04] execute?
[03:05] It's something I've changed is more something that our, our head of
[03:07] design, uh, Diego has changed, uh, basically having designers spend more
[03:13] time creating more visionary prototypes and then sharing those out in
[03:18] move videos, it just has just huge impact on, on how exciting, uh, work is
[03:24] and how excited the team are.
[03:26] Um, and so just providing that clarity is massive.
[03:29] And I think just, just again, Figma and, and loom and, and, and prototypes
[03:35] that actually are interactive.
[03:36] So people can actually play around with it is, is a huge way to unlock
[03:40] velocity.
[03:41] Final question.
[03:42] I've already asked you about this a couple of times, but I'm curious if
[03:44] there's any other productivity tip or tool that you'd recommend to listeners
[03:49] that you haven't mentioned yet.
[03:52] Turn off notifications, quit Slack, uh, when you're doing teamwork, check
[03:58] your emails once a day and just like literally go through them in like
[04:01] five minutes.
[04:02] They're off the times, most of them are useless.
[04:05] Check Slack only at the top of the hour.
[04:07] Use Slack snooze, uh, or reminders, I mean, this whole other podcast, we
[04:13] can talk about Slack channels and, and, and how to organize that.
[04:17] But, you know, just get really good at the tools you're using.
[04:20] I think the first year of consulting, we just, we just got really good
[04:23] at like Excel and Excel shortcuts.
[04:26] And it was a big part of our training.
[04:28] And so just train yourself and train your teams on how to use their
[04:31] tools, how to use your calendar, how to use Slack, how to use email,
[04:36] whatever the tool you've, you've designed as, as the right tool for you.
[04:40] Be dogmatic.
[04:41] I mean, what ramp is, is a tool at the end of the day.
[04:43] And, uh, we're helping finance seems more efficient.
[04:46] So let's, let's talk through that and do that with our own tools.
[04:50] I think we've had just enough velocity in our chat.
[04:52] I think we're going to hit a hundred million downloads.
[04:55] I think we built an A plus team here.
[04:57] Jeff, thank you so much for doing this.
[04:59] Two final questions.
[05:00] Where can folks find you online if they want to ask you any
[05:02] other questions and second question?
[05:05] Can listeners be useful to you?
[05:07] Uh, you can find me on Twitter and LinkedIn, Twitter is Jeff in tech.
[05:10] How can they be useful?
[05:11] Honestly, maybe your, your, your, your attention is a, is a gift.
[05:15] If you're interested in joining us here at ramp, um, we're, we're
[05:18] obviously hiring incredible people.
[05:20] So if anything that I shared resonates with you and you want to join the
[05:23] team and we're hiring across product engineering design, but you know,
[05:27] most importantly, you know, be kind to yourself.
[05:29] I think, you know, I've, I've been a huge listener to this podcast.
[05:31] It's an honor to be here.
[05:33] I know very little.

[05:41] keep, keep, uh, investing in that growth, um, and, uh, be patient.
