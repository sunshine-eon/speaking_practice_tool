============================================================

[00:00] Which I love
[00:01] Let's talk about
[00:02] pricing strategy and your approach to pricing another very contrarian
[00:07] Approach that you guys took where you charge $30 a month for email
[00:10] That was free that people don't need to pay for anywhere and it's worked and now a lot of companies are thinking of it this way
[00:16] You've even raised your prices recently
[00:19] What have you learned about pricing strategy that you think might be helpful to folks?
[00:22] I always say the same thing when it comes to pricing which is before you figure out pricing
[00:28] you must first figure out positioning and
[00:31] Superhuman is the best email tool on the market
[00:35] We fortunately have the metrics to show this one of the cool things about selling an email tool is you can compare
[00:42] the 30 days prior to using superhuman to the 30 days after or the year before to the year after and
[00:48] We do that obviously
[00:50] We're able to show that people get through their email twice as fast with superhuman that they respond
[00:55] One to two days faster and that they save four hours or more every single week
[01:00] Because of that we're very confident in saying that superhuman is the best email tool on the market and that we're building it for
[01:07] High-performing teams and high-performing individuals in other words. We serve the high end of the market
[01:13] Once you understand your positioning you can then move on to pricing and one of the best books on this is a book called a
[01:21] monetizing innovation by Madhavan Ramanujan and
[01:24] Madhavan covers a lot of ways to develop pricing
[01:27] We used one of the easiest methods which is the van Westendorp price sensitivity meter and in the early years
[01:34] We asked I think it was around a hundred of our earliest users
[01:38] The following four questions number one at what price would you consider superhuman to be so expensive that you would not consider buying it?
[01:46] Number two at what price would you consider superhuman to be priced so low that you'd be worried about its quality and you wouldn't buy it at number
[01:53] three
[01:54] What price would you consider superhuman to be starting to get expensive so that it's not out of the question?
[02:00] But you'd have to give some thought to buying it and
[02:03] Number four at what price would you consider superhuman to be a bargain a great buy for the money?
[02:09] now
[02:10] Most startups orient around price point number four. This is especially true for greenfield
[02:18] Opportunities marketplaces you got to set the transaction value around price point four
[02:23] Basically when you want as many people to sign up as is humanly possible at the top of the funnel
[02:30] But the price point that supports our best-in-class best-in-cattery position is actually the third one
[02:37] It starts to feel expensive
[02:39] But then you sit down and you think about the time that you spend an email the ROI and you still buy it anyway
[02:45] And it turns out that the median answer for the third question was $30 per month
[02:49] And that's how we picked our price
[02:52] And once we picked our price we then do a quick gut check on market size
[02:56] You know for example
[02:58] We're a venture scale company, but at the time the question that we had to ask is could we grow into a billion dollar valuation?
[03:05] Well, let's assume but at that point our valuation is 10 times our ARR
[03:09] So our ARR would have to be a hundred million dollars
[03:12] Well, that would be 300,000 subscribers at $30 per month
[03:15] And that is conservatively assuming no other ways to increase
[03:20] ARP you mentioned price increase you can also go at market you can sell new products and so on that we asked ourselves
[03:27] Without those tricks
[03:28] do we think we can get to hundreds of thousands of subscribers and
[03:34] We answered emphatically yes, and so we went ahead with that price
[03:38] Okay, there's a couple more things I want to chat about in the time that we have and then I know you have to run
[03:43] One is around AI and the work you guys are doing there
[03:45] I know that's been a big unlock and then to the stuff you're doing in the enterprise
[03:48] And then if we have time there's a question I want to ask that I think it's a really interesting way you guys operate
