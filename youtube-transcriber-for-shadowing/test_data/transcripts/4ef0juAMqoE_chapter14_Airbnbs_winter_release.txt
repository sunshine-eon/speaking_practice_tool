Chapter 14: Airbnb’s winter release
Video: Brian Chesky’s new playbook
Time: 38:48 - 41:47
============================================================

[00:00] Speaking of rowing in the same direction, you had a huge launch today.
[00:04] I know you wanted to talk about it, your winter release, and it kind of is the culmination
[00:08] of a lot of the things you're talking about.
[00:09] I'd love to hear just some of the stuff you're launching.
[00:11] Let me just back up, Saleni.
[00:13] So you know this problem really well.
[00:16] One of the best things of Airbnb is that we're this marketplace where guests and hosts come
[00:21] together and we have all this unique inventory and people list on Airbnb and every home is
[00:26] one of a kind.
[00:27] There are seven million homes and there's all the surprise and all the delight.
[00:31] The problem is that every home is one of a kind and you often don't know what you're
[00:36] going to get.
[00:38] And so a lot of guests have described checking into Airbnb as a moment of truth, where when
[00:44] you open the door that you know the home, you find out if the home is exactly the home
[00:49] that you booked.
[00:51] And this turns out to be a big problem for people wanting to book an Airbnb.
[00:56] And when we surveyed guests or people who don't use Airbnb, the number one hotel is
[01:02] not a special.
[01:03] They're not as unique.
[01:04] But the advantage they have is you know what you're going to get.
[01:06] You know exactly what you're going to get.
[01:08] And so what we found is that reliability is Airbnb's Achilles heel, or at least it has
[01:13] been, that with hotels, you know you're going to get an Airbnb you don't always know you're
[01:17] going to get.
[01:18] And so we asked ourselves, what if we could combine the uniqueness of Airbnb with the
[01:24] reliability that you've come to spec no tell.
[01:27] And that's what we've done with guest favorites.
[01:30] Guest favorites are you know homes that guests in our community love the most.
[01:35] We took 370 million reviews on Airbnb plus millions of customer service tickets plus
[01:41] all the host cancellation data.
[01:43] And we use all the signal to create the top 2 million homes that this collection of 2
[01:48] million homes that we call guest favorites because the gallons the guests rate the highest.
[01:52] We think combined the uniqueness of Airbnb with the reliability you come to expect no
[01:57] tell and I can't imagine there's a lot of use case where you wouldn't want to book a
[02:00] guest favorite.
[02:02] We think that's also part of this broader system of readings and reviews.
[02:06] You see as you know Airbnb is built on a system of trust and we invented this new way for
[02:10] people to trust one another, you know at least at scale, you know through living together
[02:15] certainly.
[02:16] And we felt like the reading review system could use a little bit of an upgrade.
[02:20] So we obviously made some upgrades to the readings reviews.
[02:22] And the final thing and this brings up another point I might bring up is we've completely
[02:27] overhauled the host tab.
[02:29] So you know one of the most important things when you get to an Airbnb is the listing is
[02:33] accurate.
[02:34] But the problem is that a lot of host listings don't have all the details up to up to date.
[02:41] So they might not like describe perfectly their listing.
[02:44] They might not have filled up their amenities.
[02:46] They might not have a photo tour.
[02:47] And the reason why as we're doing research is because they found it was hard to manage
[02:51] their listing.
[02:53] And it was hard to manage your listing because it was designed as this hodgepodge thing by
[02:56] different teams over many years.
