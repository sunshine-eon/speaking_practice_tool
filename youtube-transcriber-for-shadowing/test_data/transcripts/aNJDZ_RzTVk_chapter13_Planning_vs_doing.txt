============================================================

[00:00] do the more things happen, the more you get done,
[00:02] everything's happening.
[00:03] And the other end also, it also feels a bit chaotic.
[00:06] And I'm curious how you find that balance between,
[00:09] okay, we're not gonna spend all this time planning,
[00:11] we're just gonna go, go, go, go, go.
[00:13] And just how you think about that balance
[00:16] and how it actually ends up working out at Ramp.
[00:18] Sounds like not spending a ton of time planning.
[00:21] Yeah, I was like, like when new joiners come at Ramp,
[00:24] I intro myself and I'd talk about our product strategy.
[00:28] And I end in the meeting with an apology.
[00:30] I say, you've signed an implicit contract joining Ramp.
[00:35] It's one where we prioritize velocity
[00:37] over almost everything else.
[00:39] What that means is it'll be somewhat chaotic.
[00:42] We'll ship things that don't work.
[00:44] We will change our products without necessarily
[00:47] fully enabling you.
[00:49] And you'll have to constantly be on your toes
[00:51] whenever you load up a demo instance.
[00:53] And I think that it's kind of an expectation
[00:55] and people are welcoming of that
[00:58] because they understand that the trade-off is
[01:01] that we don't move forward,
[01:03] that we don't actually innovate,
[01:04] that we don't continue to provide value for our customers.
[01:08] I think there's certain things that we plan for.
[01:12] And so the question really is like,
[01:14] because accuracy has cost,
[01:16] make sure that you're only increasing the accuracy
[01:19] of planning for the things that have
[01:21] high value of that accuracy.
[01:23] And so the things for us are large market moments
[01:27] where we have products, marketing,
[01:30] and sales all coordinating these big moments.
[01:35] And those typically happen maybe once a quarter,
[01:38] once every six months, basically your marketing calendar.
[01:41] We need a plan for that, for sure.
[01:43] But it's oftentimes a low percentage
[01:46] of our total R&D focus.
[01:48] And so it's totally fine for each team
[01:50] to be somewhat autonomous, somewhat chaotic
[01:52] within their pod.
[01:54] They're extremely clear, but for the outside in,
[01:56] might be very chaotic,
[01:58] but be very accurate on the things
[02:00] that truly, truly matter.
[02:01] The rest actually doesn't matter.
[02:02] You don't need a lot of accuracy and confidence on
[02:06] when specifically certain features will be live.
[02:08] It's much better to spend whatever time you would spend
[02:11] trying to create accuracy and creating velocity.
[02:15] I love that you said expectations very clearly up front.
[02:18] That seems really important to be successful
[02:20] at a company like that.
[02:22] It also just makes me remember every successful startup
[02:26] is extremely chaotic.
[02:28] As much as it may not feel like that on the outside,
[02:30] it's insanely chaotic.
[02:31] Things are constantly changing.
[02:33] I was at a fireside chat with Cheryl Sandberg once
[02:36] at Airbnb and somebody asked her just like,
[02:39] how do you deal with change?
[02:40] Things are just, we're reorg-ing every six months.
[02:43] People are believing and coming
[02:44] and teams are shifting and priorities are always adjusting.
[02:47] And she's just like, this is the problem you want.
[02:49] You want to be going through this
[02:51] because that means you're growing
[02:52] and you're going through hypergrowth
[02:54] because the alternative is much worse
[02:56] where you're not growing and that's much more painful.
[02:59] So I think it's just a good reminder
[03:00] that if you're working at a place that's chaotic,
[03:01] it's often a good thing.
[03:04] I would say so.
[03:05] I mean, oftentimes people use that excuse
[03:07] to not have a very strong strategy.
[03:11] And I think that for us,
[03:14] we've always been from the start,
[03:17] the spam management platform that helps you spend less
[03:19] or strategy, I share like an annual newsletter
[03:23] around what we did and what we're going to do next year.
[03:26] And it's oftentimes pretty spot on in terms of the goals.
[03:29] Again, the goals and the value
[03:31] and the problem and the vision, that's consistent.
[03:34] The specifics, the timing, the quarterly scopes,
[03:38] like all these things, yes, like it changes.
[03:40] But what you want to avoid is the thrash of people
[03:43] waking up and feeling like they're working
[03:45] at a different company
[03:46] or that leaders are constantly changing their minds.
[03:48] We've been extremely consistent from the start.
[03:50] And I think most of the products that we build,
[03:52] most of the code that we were in,
[03:54] is in the customer's hands and hasn't been ripped away.
[03:56] And I think that speaks a lot to velocity too.
[04:00] Awesome, that was a good addition.
[04:01] And I mean to say, if your place is chaotic,
[04:04] it's no problem, it's that side effect of growth
[04:08] and hyper growth is things are gonna be pretty chaotic.

[05:09] So you've talked about strategy a couple of times,
[05:11] and I just wanna dig into that a little bit.
[05:13] So there's kind of maybe a couple of directions we can go.
[05:15] One is you talked about this contract you create
[05:16] with teams of a strategy.
[05:18] So maybe let's just go there.
[05:20] What does that actually look like?
