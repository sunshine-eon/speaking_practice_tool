============================================================

Yeah, that is so unique, and I rarely hear of a company being able to hire that way. I imagine one of the reasons you can get away with that—where people don’t have a full-time job for a while while we're doing a paid trial—is because Linear is such an enticing place to work. I imagine for a lot of companies, they can't really do that. But I guess any thoughts on just maybe more companies can actually pull this off?

Yeah, I mean, I think it's always like, if you don't ask, you don't know. In our case, that's just been the standard, and we try to work with the candidate. Let's figure out maybe we do it on the weekend, or maybe we do it some other time, like a vacation holiday or something. There can be ways we can schedule it so that it causes as little disruption to the candidate as possible. I think we only had a few people probably ever decline it. It’s not like everyone else has been, at least after the fact, unhappy with it because they felt like they had a much better sense of the company they were joining.

Also, by doing that work drop, they can actually join our meetings, take access to our Slack and Notion, and have one-on-one chats with some of the other people on the team. They already get to know people, so it's a good way for them to evaluate us as well. For us, what’s important is to see how this person operates in this kind of environment. How do they approach problems? How do they think? Are they able to make progress in a very short timeframe? I always think that’s very important for startups. In large companies, you might have all the time in the world to do stuff, but in any kind of startup—even with us, when we take our time doing things—it’s still important that we can do things quickly if we have to.

Super cool. Just to close the thread on product sensibilities, is there anything you could share about how you actually help understand someone's strengths and abilities there?

Yeah, I wouldn’t say we have some kind of very scientific or special way to figure it out. A lot of it is like a discussion. I often ask people about their projects and try to go deeper. It’s like, why was this decision made? Why do you think the decision was made? I might ask, do you think it was the right decision? Did you agree with it? Or I might ask, what do you think you would have done differently? I think it’s more about seeing if they have thoughts in this area and what their answers are.

People's answers can vary widely. Some might say, “Yeah, I didn’t like it,” which is an opinion, but it’s not based on anything. It’s just like, you didn’t like it. They should be able to expand on it, saying, “Well, I don’t like it because in this case, it would not work well for this kind of user or in this kind of context.” They need to have more reasoning or some kind of rationale for why they think this way, and they should be able to articulate that.

So I think that’s what we often test for: can they do this, and how well can they do it? There’s going to be a very wide range of how people approach this. When you see someone who really thinks about this stuff, it’s very clear they can talk about it forever and go deeper and deeper. On the other hand, some people who maybe haven’t had the experience or don’t think this way might say, “Yeah, I don’t really know. I just build it, and it seems fine.”
