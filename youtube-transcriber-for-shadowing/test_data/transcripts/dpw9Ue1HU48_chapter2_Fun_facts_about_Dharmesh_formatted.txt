============================================================

I'm a wildly fascinating human. And so I thought it'd be fun to start with just a bunch of fun facts that I found about you online. What I'm thinking is I'll just walk through them, and you can tell me if they're true as I go. This will lead to a bunch of different topics that I want to talk about. How does that sound?

That was great. Okay, here we go. So one, you have no direct reports, and I don't believe you've ever had direct reports at HubSpot. 

That is correct. 7,000 plus employees, exactly zero direct reports from time t equals zero. 

Okay, we're going to talk about that. You also don't do one-on-one meetings as a result. You don't have reports to have one-on-one meetings with. 

That's correct. You built many side projects while at HubSpot, including a product called WordPlay, which at one point made $90,000 per month and had 16 million users. 

That is correct. You also bought chat.com for $10 million, and then you sold it two months later for more money than you bought it for. 

It was actually $15 plus million dollars, but I had kind of stated eight figures. But yeah, is this breaking news? 

It's breaking news. Wow, so that's how much you bought it for. 

Yes. Okay, and you sold it still for an undisclosed amount. Is that right? 

Undisclosed amount, yeah. And more than that, college they got. 

Yeah, there was a profit, and I knew you gave some money to charity. There were some promises you made where people commented on your LinkedIn post, and you gave more money away, so that was awesome. 

Okay, also you're a billionaire. 

That is once again true. It's still true. 

Great. Also, you were born in a village in India that had no paved streets, no traffic lights, no hospitals. 

That is correct. 

Okay. Before HubSpot, you founded two companies, but I think the more important fact there is you promised your wife you would not start another company before you started HubSpot, and then you ended up going on and starting HubSpot. 

Yes, I had promised her that I would not do startups. I had kind of hung up the proverbial entrepreneurial hat. Best laid plans and all that. I met my co-founder in grad school, which was the plan. So I thought I’d go back to grad school and find myself, and then the plan was to eventually teach, not do another startup. But I met my co-founder there, and one thing led to another as these things go. 

I hope she's forgiven you. 

I do too. Ha ha ha.
