Video: Mastering product strategy and growing as a PM | Maggie Crowley (Toast, Drift, TripAdvisor)
Time: 00:00 - 04:06
============================================================

If you ever find yourself saying something like, "that's not my job," that's probably a thing you should do. It may not be your job, and it could very well be someone else's responsibility. You can spend your life getting frustrated about it, or you can just get over it and get the work done. People who are willing to just get the work done will move faster, their products will be more successful, and they probably aren't carrying around all that anger and negativity. 

As a PM, for better or for worse, you are often the emotional center of the team. It's your job to keep people motivated, excited, and bought into the project. You have to maintain that optimism, which can be hard work. Sometimes, it can be as simple as saying, "You know what, let me take that on. I'll do this thing. I'll hop on the sales call. I'll implement this with the customer." You just have to do whatever it takes.

Today, my guest is Maggie Crowley. Maggie is currently the Vice President of Product at Toast. Prior to this, she was the VP and Head of Product at Charlie Health, Senior Director of Product at Drift, Director of Product at Bev Spot, and Product Manager at TripAdvisor. She also holds an MBA from Harvard Business School and was an Olympic speed skater, which is both insane and incredibly cool.

In our conversation, we discuss the three most common threads across the best product managers that she's worked with, hired, and managed. We cover how to tactically write out a product strategy to share with your team and manager, why being data-driven can be a red flag for product thinking, and the dangers of product content you find online. Maggie shares her best advice for breaking into product management and reflects on the impact of writing online on her career. 

Maggie is amazing, and I'm excited for you to learn from her just as I did. With that, I bring you Maggie Crowley after a short word from our sponsors.
