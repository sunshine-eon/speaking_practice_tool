============================================================

Melany, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast. 

Thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to be here. 

I'm even more excited. It's such an honor to have you here. I am such a fan of yours. I'm such a fan of the company that you've built. Also, just everyone I meet from Canva is just so nice and so awesome and so smart. And so clearly you've built something really special. I'm really excited to use this hour to learn as much as I can from you about how you did that. 

We were actually chatting ahead of this about what would make the best use of this hour. I asked you what you believe has been the biggest factor in the success of Canva. You described something called building a column B company in Columb B Thinking. I've never heard of this before. So let us start there. What is building a Columb B company? What does that mean? 

Really great place to start. So I guess there's two ways of planning. The way that you can plan is you can dream of like what is the perfect vision of the future? What future do you want to exist in? What would you like the world to look like? What would you like companies to look like? And then going from there, which is completely improbable, a completely crazy big dream, and then working hard to turn that into reality. 

The alternative is, so just imagine you're building a castle on the hill and you're like, what would be the most magical, wonderful mythical thing in the world? What would be the most magical, wonderful, mythical experience? The other thing you can do is you can look at the bricks around you and you can say, what can I do with these bricks? How high can I stack them? What can I do? 

I think most planning is often done by looking at the bricks and trying to stack them. Then you kind of, you know, you can create only so much. So I guess the Columb B Thinking is thinking about what is that magical, wonderful future that you then want to invest years and decades of your life actually building. And so that's Columb A and Columb B.
