============================================================

So just a simple idea that is clearly going to benefit you and your team. It's interesting that people don't often do this or haven't even thought about doing it. To get a little bit deeper, how do you actually execute this meeting? Who do you invite? What questions do you ask? When exactly do you do this? 

As I started doing pre mortems, they became more popular at Stripe. Other teams began to adopt them, and I even helped some startups implement pre mortems. At some point, I decided I should write down my template for pre mortems. I worked with the folks at Koda to create a Koda doc, which you can find, and we can put in the show notes if possible. This document serves as a complete template for how to run pre mortems using the method I discussed, including tigers, paper tigers, elephants, and all of that.

The main thing about a pre mortem is to include people from every function involved in, say, a launch. For a really large launch, I sometimes separate it into two groups. One group focuses on the engineering side, where I bring in every engineer, which is really important. This meeting might include 10, 15, or even 20 engineers, along with a PM and maybe a design counterpart, all focused on what could go wrong from a product engineering perspective. 

For the go-to-market side of a large launch, I like to hold a separate pre mortem. This group will involve the sales team, support team, marketing team, the involved design team, and some core engineering leads. PR will also be present, and we will discuss more of the go-to-market risks. For smaller launches, I prefer to have one meeting where everyone is present. I usually start with the prompt of imagining that the launch has failed.

As the pre mortem meeting leader, it's my responsibility to share the prompt. I like to alternate between speaking and quiet time during these meetings. After sharing the prompt, I say, "Okay, now the next five or ten minutes is quiet time," where people start entering their own tigers, paper tigers, and elephants in a way that nobody else sees. After that, we go around the room to share our thoughts.

One innovation I added was asking people to pick the tiger they find scarier, but not their own—rather, someone else's tiger that they find more concerning. This ends up being a sort of voting process. As the pre mortem leader, I take all the output generated by the team and prioritize it. The goal is not to solve every problem but to identify threats that we might not be discussing openly or that we might be assuming someone else will address, only to find out that nobody was thinking about it.

After the pre mortem, I like to create a post-pre mortem action plan and share that with the team, holding myself accountable for making progress on it. Since I started doing this, have you noticed a reduced need for post mortems? Are projects failing less, or are there fewer problems? What kind of impact have you seen from executing this idea?

Absolutely, I've seen us identify certain issues that likely would not have come up otherwise. You can't really run a simulation to see what the counterfactual would look like in real life, but those issues would have likely resulted in problematic situations afterwards. A great example is when a company announces something and faces massive backlash. A reasonable observer might wonder how the company missed this.

What happens is they experience backlash, realize it, and then start doing damage control. Sometimes they might even backtrack and undo their decision, saying they didn't think about these issues. They might ask for more time and relaunch the feature in a better way. To a casual observer, it may seem obvious what issues would arise, and sometimes it is obvious to some team members. However, the problem is that they might not have created the psychological safety or vocabulary to discuss these issues objectively and decide with intent whether to address them.

I see many scenarios in our industry that end up wasting time. A pre mortem is a very inexpensive way to identify these issues because it only requires one meeting, followed by some work from the leader to prioritize, and then some mitigating actions that would have been necessary anyway. That's why I'm a huge fan of pre mortems; they are low downside but high upside.

I'm excited to see this template. I haven't seen it yet, and I don't know that you put one together, so that's awesome. We'll link it in the notes.
