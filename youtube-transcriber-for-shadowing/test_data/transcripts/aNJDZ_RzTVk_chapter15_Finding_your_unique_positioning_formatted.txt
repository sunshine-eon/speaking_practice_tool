One of the biggest values, I think, of software is how do you reuse the components that you've built to increase, again, velocity and impact. Why we were interested in bill payments as an expansion of our corporate card platform was we saw a bill as just an invoice to the company, and an expense was an invoice to the employee. So there was a lot of parallels between these two things. It was all about having a liability. It was all about processing that liability in terms of the financial event and moving the money. Moving the money either between the company, between the company and the employee, or between two companies.

We believed that we were uniquely positioned to get after that space because we already had money movement. We already had some type of liability. We already integrated with accounting systems, and we had a pretty strong risk process that can govern all that. The employees that were requesting to pay these bills were already on the platform. So that's an example of a right to win. I think that if you continue to focus on where you're uniquely positioned to win, you'll increase velocity because you already have a lot of the components of the expertise.

I love that. It's not something you really see in teams, docs of just why we have the right to win this. So I think that's a really interesting element. By the way, I should mention we'll link to a template of your planning approach in the show notes, which we also had in the post that we worked on. So folks are trying to write down notes of all these little bullet points. We'll link to a doc that has all these things.

What do you think of OKRs, and how do you approach OKRs as a part of this planning? I largely stay away from OKRs from a product perspective. I think that, I guess,
