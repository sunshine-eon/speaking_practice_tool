============================================================

What's interesting about this is if you've heard the episode on Ramp and how Ramp builds product with Jeff Charles, there's such a different ways of building product. Ramp is all about velocity, shipping all the time, metrics, measuring everything. Your approach is almost the opposite. I think what's interesting there as a takeaway is just there's many ways to do it. You just have to do it almost fully, and you have to have really specific people. It feels like the people want to work in a certain way, and a lot of it I think also is the founder has to be natural to the way the founder operates and thinks about building a company.

Yeah, and for sure. If you look at successful companies, Amazon is very different than Apple in how they operate. Both of them are successful but not in the same way. So I think it's a decision you make as a company or as a founder about what kind of company you want to build. I do think there are some aspects of the domain that you're in. What does that domain and the problem space require from the company?

For us, I think it's like we are in the retention business and the trust business. Ideally, we have a company starting to use Linear very early on, and then they stay with us forever. I think the only way we can do that is by continuously delivering them good quality product and maintaining that trust that we won’t fail them or somehow otherwise mistreat them. Some businesses are much more transactional, where it's like, yeah, we just need to make this e-commerce sale, and then once it's done, we don't care what happens.

In our case, it's more like we really need to build this relationship over time. That's why I think some of the choices we make are also kind of more about respecting the customer versus just wanting to drive the revenue of the company.
