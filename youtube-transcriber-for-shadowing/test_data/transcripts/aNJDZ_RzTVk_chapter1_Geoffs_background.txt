============================================================

[00:00] So when I joined, we were about 10-ish folks, about eight engineers, and in three months
[00:04] we built a competitor to MX. Six months after that, we built a competitor to Expensify both
[00:09] public and strategic companies. We hit 100 million in annual revenue. I think we were
[00:13] under at that 50 total in the R&D department, less than four engineers and three PMs. And
[00:18] then we started expanding into a Calc Payable. It was three engineers, one designer, one
[00:22] PM, three months, and they hit out of the park, and that product is moving and
[00:26] builds a dollar a year. And I think, you know, the recipe for all this is.
[00:32] Welcome to Lenny's podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders
[00:35] and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and
[00:38] growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Jeff Charles, who is
[00:43] VP of product at Ramp. This episode is a unique glimpse into a startup and an
[00:47] approach to product that optimizes for moving quickly, thinking from first
[00:51] principles and empowering individual team members. If you're not familiar with
[00:54] Ramp, they are the fastest growing SaaS business in history, getting to over
[00:59] $100 million in annual run rate in two years, which is just wild. And as you'll
[01:05] hear in this episode, they did this with 50 people. In our conversation, Jeff
[01:08] shares how they operationalize a culture of velocity, how they do a lot with
[01:13] few people, how they organize planning, how they define strategy, how they
[01:17] interview product managers and keep a very high bar for talent, plus also
[01:21] avoid burnout in a very fast moving culture. And so much more, my advice is
[01:26] to seriously study how Ramp operates because there's a lot to learn from
[01:30] their success and their approach to product. Enjoy this episode with Jeff
[01:35] Charles after a short word from our sponsors. This episode is brought to
[01:40] you by ASRA, the leading full-body cancer screening company. I actually
[01:44] used ASRA earlier this year, unrelated to this podcast, completely on my own
[01:48] dime, because my wife did one and loved it. And I was super curious to see if
[01:54] there's anything that I should be paying attention to in my body as I get
[01:57] older. The way it works is you book an appointment, you come in, you put on
[02:01] some very cool silky pajamas that they give you that you get to keep
[02:04] afterwards. You go into an MRI machine for 30 to 45 minutes. And then
[02:09] about a week later, you get this detailed report sharing what they
[02:12] found in your body. Luckily, I had what they called an unremarkable
[02:16] screening, which means they didn't find anything cancerous. But they did find
[02:20] some issues in my back, which I'm getting checked out at a physical next
[02:24] month, probably because I spend so much time sitting in front of a computer.
[02:28] Half of all men will have cancer at some point in their lives, as will
[02:31] one third of women. Half of all of them will detect it late. According
[02:36] to the American Cancer Society, early cancer detection has an 80%
[02:40] survival rate compared to less than 20% for late stage cancer. The
[02:44] Ezra team has helped 13% of their customers identify potential cancer
[02:48] early, and 50% of them identify other clinically significant issues such
[02:53] as aneurysms, disc herniations, which maybe is what I have, or fatty liver
[02:58] disease. Ezra scans for cancer and 500 other conditions in 13 organs
[03:03] using a full body MRI powered by AI, and just launched the world's
[03:08] only 30 minute full body scan, which is also their most affordable. Their
[03:12] scans are noninvasive and radiation free. And Ezra is offering
[03:16] listeners $150 off their first scan with code Lenny150. Book your
[03:22] scan at Ezra.com slash Lenny at ezra.com slash Lenny.
[03:30] This episode is brought to you by Koda. You've heard me talk
[03:33] about how Koda is the doc that brings it all together. And how
[03:37] can help your team run smoother and be more efficient? I know
[03:40] this firsthand because Koda does that for me. I use Koda every
[03:43] day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview
[03:46] notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More
[03:50] recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Koda's product
[03:53] team operates. And within that post, they shared a dozen
[03:56] templates that they use internally to run their product
[03:59] team, including managing the roadmap, their okay our
[04:02] process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their
[04:05] whole product development process is done within Koda. If
[04:08] your team's work is spread out across different documents and
[04:10] spreadsheets, and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you
[04:14] need Koda. Koda puts data in one centralized location,
[04:17] regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can
[04:20] slow your team down. Koda allows your team to operate on
[04:23] the same information and collaborate in one place. Take
