============================================================

[00:00] I'm going to give people a list of the things you guys do.
[00:01] We didn't do this at the beginning because it would take too long,
[00:04] but you talk about all the products you're building and all the things that's going on.
[00:07] So I have like a list here that it may, it's probably incomplete,
[00:09] but just to give people a sense.
[00:11] So you guys have credit cards, debit cards, savings accounts, multi-currency accounts,
[00:16] domestic international transfers, joint accounts, minors, accounts for like less than people,
[00:21] less than 18 years old, stock trading, cryptocurrency purchasing, loans.
[00:28] Is there anything big I missed?
[00:30] I mean, some of those things are huge by itself.
[00:33] Let's say stock trading, right?
[00:34] It's not just stocks, it's also ETFs, bonds, and we're working on tax-efficient accounts
[00:46] in different countries.
[00:47] And crypto, we also allow staking crypto, for example.
[00:53] We have on-ramp or frump products.
[00:57] We have acquiring products.
[00:59] On credit, we have loans.
[01:00] We have a by now, by later product.
[01:03] We even launched mortgages.
[01:05] We launched the first mortgages in Lithuania recently.
[01:09] And then all of these across 50 different currencies and countries.
[01:14] Yeah, 50 different jurisdictions with each with its own regulation, with its own requirements.
[01:21] No, boy.
[01:23] This is, it's a good example of, Paul Graham has this concept of schlepp blindness or schlepping,
[01:28] where people want to avoid hard problems.
[01:31] But that's where the big opportunities are, solving really gnarly, painful problems.
[01:36] And that's basically what you guys did.
[01:39] Yeah, that's one of the things that excites me, maybe the most, to Revolut.
[01:46] The market is so big, and there are still a lot of very inefficient players.
[01:53] And as a result, customers have a lot of problems that are unsolved.
[01:59] While we grow insanely, and I think will soon be, so when I joined, we had maybe just slightly north to 20 million customers.
[02:10] Now we are 50 million customers, soon we'll be at 100 million customers.
[02:14] The degree of, you know, surrounding each customer with the ecosystem of our products extends a lot.
[02:22] So they become more and more people start using Revolut as their main bank account.
[02:28] They start receiving the, the salary into Revolut, holding their savings into Revolut, because they love the product more.
[02:36] And so we can easily do another, I don't know, two, three acts for acts in customer based growth.
[02:45] But we can also do another 10x growth in how actively these people are using the product.
[02:52] So it's, let's say, what 30, 40 acts to current 45 billion valuation, right?
[02:59] So it's, it's like a trillion dollar company easily.
[03:06] And on that note, what I'm hearing is it's still a great time to join.
[03:10] There's a massive upside.
[03:11] So I know you guys are hiring.
[03:12] We'll just note that real quick.
[03:13] There's a, you're hiring product owners and a bunch of other roles, I imagine.
[03:17] Yeah.
[03:17] Yeah.
[03:18] Yeah.
[03:18] We, well, uh, as, as someone who owns the product function, I'm especially interested in product owners, obviously.
[03:26] But we, yeah, we hire a lot of roles.
[03:28] I think we have maybe a three or 400 open positions currently.
