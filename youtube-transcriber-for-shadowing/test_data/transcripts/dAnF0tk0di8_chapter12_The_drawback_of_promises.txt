============================================================

[00:00] You have these quotes along these lines about planning, long-term business planning is a
[00:05] fantasy. I don't plan long-term because I want to do what I think, not what I thought.
[00:10] Yes.
[00:10] I love these. This whole idea of appetites, it's very appealing. It makes so much sense.
[00:15] It's like the ultimate impact to effort calculation. The effort we will put into
[00:20] this is fixed and we will not go beyond this because the impact we expect from this is
[00:25] pretty clear. If the effort goes up and up and up, why did we even do this?
[00:31] But obviously, the downside is you can't promise things really to sales marketing,
[00:37] which I think makes sense in your type of business. Do you see this work in
[00:41] businesses that aren't your business, this approach?
[00:43] Let me talk about promises for a second. Promises are the downfall of every business.
[00:49] Every time we've made a promise to get something out in a certain period of time,
[00:53] we inevitably seem to miss it. It's almost like it would have been out in time,
[01:00] but the fact that we had promised it made it not deliver in time.
[01:04] There's some strange thing that happens when you promise things.
[01:09] We've learned to not promise anything. We can share what we're working on if we want to.
[01:14] We can tell people we're doing something. By the way, the worst promise, and by the
[01:18] way, we've made a couple of these recently. We always regret them. It's like by the
[01:21] end of the year. That's the one promise you've got to be very careful of because it's so easy to make.
[01:27] There's nothing easier than promising work later. The further away it is, the easier it is to promise.
[01:33] This whole by the end of the year, red flag. Whenever you say that to yourself,
[01:40] go, oh, wait a second. Wait, wait, wait. What am I doing right now? Because you're
[01:44] probably setting yourself up for disappointment. As far as other companies
[01:47] running this way, there are a number of other companies that are running this way
[01:50] and more and more are adopting shape up all the time. But it's a struggle. It's hard.
[01:55] It's hard to change the way you work.
