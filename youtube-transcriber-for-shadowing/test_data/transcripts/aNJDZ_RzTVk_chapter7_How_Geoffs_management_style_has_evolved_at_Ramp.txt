[00:00] like that. It feels like to move fast, you need to do what you're talking about, which
[00:05] is empower your teams to just move. Otherwise, it's not scalable. And I'm curious just to
[00:11] make it even more real. Is there an a version of something you did at your previous work
[00:17] versus at Ramp that just shows what that looks like when you're empowering your team and
[00:21] not in the weeds? What's like most different there is that the product reviews you're
[00:24] not as involved in design iterations, like where do you come in to actually give
[00:29] feedback? How does it actually look like working at a Ramp versus another company?
[00:34] I think that the contract between me and the team is really their strategy and
[00:41] their roadmap. And as long as we are aligned on on the strategy and we can
[00:47] get into that and aligned on the roadmap and the timing, that's their
[00:50] contract. And so then at that point, my goal is to continue to give them
[00:55] context to execute on that and to coach them through that by getting first-hand
[01:00] data on how things are going that they might be missing. And their role is to
[01:06] highlight risks and highlight one-way decisions that they need my input on. And
[01:12] again, it didn't used to start that way. I mean, when we first started, it was
[01:15] just me and another PM. I was fairly micromanaging in some in some areas. I
[01:19] think you build trust over time and you start having these contracts. And
[01:23] so as I suppose, get more senior, they're basically polishing out the API by
[01:27] which they interact with me. And we basically align on what's most important
[01:31] on each one-on-one. So I basically have teams, all my directs post their
[01:37] goals every week. First thing Monday, the goal there is to also have them
[01:42] review each other's goals. I have a one-on-one template that I basically
[01:46] use to keep track of how progress is being made. But I certainly don't
[01:50] spend the time in the one-on-one going into that. I spend the one-on-one just
[01:53] focusing on what they need from me. And then on a bi-weekly basis, I have a team-wide
[01:59] meeting where I share context that everyone is missing. And we go deep on the
[02:05] most important topics of the day.
[02:07] What about the product experience itself? Is there a design review that
[02:11] happens? How do you stay on top of just like, I'm proud of this product
[02:13] that we're shipping as a team?
[02:15] I'd say we're iterating. I think when the first couple of years
