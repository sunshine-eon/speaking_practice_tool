============================================================

Coming back to this as a path people can take with their business versus a traditional venture scale business, this path is essentially about building something, selling it, making money, and living a chill life. It’s not about being super stressed, growth-focused, or obsessed with building a billion-dollar company. Do you think this path is something everyone should pursue? Is it suited for a specific type of personality or product? 

I’m glad there are some people who take the big shot venture scale route. I mean, there are businesses that wouldn’t have worked out had they not taken on a bunch of funding and gone big. Clearly, there are many impressive businesses that do that. But let’s face it, those are extreme outliers. The majority of companies on this planet run like ours. They’re bootstrapped, they don’t have any money, and no one is willing to give them a penny. They open up a shop somewhere, do something, put their shingle out, launch a website, and try to make it work. 

So, most people are doing it our way. Even though in our industry it seems like we’re the outliers, we’re not. We’re actually incredibly boring and mainstream, really. If you were to pick any random business owner on the street, they’d run their business like us. They have to make more money than they spend; otherwise, they’re out. They don’t have this big cushion of millions sitting in the bank that they can just spend on things. So, they keep an eye on costs and think about this carefully. 

But yeah, I’m glad there are people who are going for the moonshot, doing it their way, and pushing boundaries. The world moves forward sometimes because of those businesses, and it’s great. I admire them; it’s just that it’s not the path I would take. I think this is the important point I want to get across: I’m not really, hopefully, coming off as encouraging everyone to be like me. I’m not saying that at all. 

What I am saying is that this is a way to be. It’s an alternative to what you often hear in our industry, which is “go big or go home,” raise a bunch of money, and achieve unicorn status. That’s one way to do it, but just know that almost nobody makes it that way. Really, almost nobody truly makes it that way. There’s a lot more room to build a successful business if you throw out that outlier and look at all the other places you can land as a business. 

My interest lies in optionality. If I could land in 135 different positions and have a sustainable business, that’s great, versus saying there’s only one way I’m going to be successful or happy. Those odds aren’t really in anyone’s favor, even though, of course, some people win the lottery. I’m not saying it’s all luck; there is a degree of luck involved, including the fact that we’ve made it. But the point is that there are only a few slots for a few companies like that at any one time. Meanwhile, there are hundreds or thousands of slots for other kinds of companies to succeed if they don’t go for the moon.
