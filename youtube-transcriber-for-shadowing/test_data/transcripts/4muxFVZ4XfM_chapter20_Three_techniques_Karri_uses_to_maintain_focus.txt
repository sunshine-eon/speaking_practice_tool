============================================================

[00:00] Something you're really good at personally is focus.
[00:04] I find that just trying to get you on this podcast
[00:06] was a lot of like, hey, Kari,
[00:08] hey, have you thought about this yet?
[00:10] And I know that a lot of VCs are just reaching out to you
[00:13] all the time, all these really fancy VCs
[00:15] that are just trying to talk to you and get close to you.
[00:17] And I just know you're really good at avoiding shiny objects
[00:21] and staying really focused and really heads down.
[00:23] And I've always wanted to just ask you,
[00:25] how do you do that?
[00:26] Do you have any tricks, systems, processes, approaches
[00:29] of staying focused other than just ignore the inbox mostly?
[00:34] Yeah, I don't think there's any complicated processes.
[00:37] And so I think one of the things like I was in YC in 2012
[00:40] and one of the things, the main thing they say there
[00:43] is what you should be focusing on when you build a startup.
[00:46] It's talk to customers, build the product, exercise.
[00:49] And if you find yourself doing something else
[00:53] than those three things, it's probably
[00:55] the wrong thing to do.
[00:56] And everybody said exercise or?
[00:58] Yeah, yeah.
[01:00] And the exercise is that it's important for you
[01:03] to be healthy or not to burn yourself out.
[01:06] So I think it was like a balance at-wise to that.
[01:12] I love it.
[01:14] So I'm doing those three things.
[01:15] And so I think the thinking there is like,
[01:20] I think we often as a company also talk about this
[01:24] and very early on.
[01:26] And I use this the same way.
[01:27] And I think the company can use it the same way.
[01:29] It's like, I think there's always things
[01:31] that you're supposed to do.
[01:33] Or it sounds like a good idea to do.
[01:36] And it could be like, yeah, come to this podcast.
[01:39] And I actually think before it wasn't like,
[01:42] or I always have these questions like,
[01:43] is this important to do now?
[01:45] Or is it important to maybe do later?
[01:48] So I think for example, the question on this podcast
[01:50] is like, I didn't feel like it was important to do it
[01:52] earlier because we weren't at the stage or scale
[01:56] or something that I think would be as interesting or something.
[02:00] So I think it was a better timing to do it later.
[02:04] Similarly, when we built the product initially,
[02:07] we were just very focused on like,
[02:09] is this really important thing to do?
[02:12] There's always like, yeah, you could get like SOC2,
[02:15] security kind of certificate.
[02:18] And we know that eventually we need to get it,
[02:20] but we don't need it today.
[02:23] So we just say no to that.
[02:24] And if customer asks for it, we say we don't have it.
[02:27] And we will have it one day, but not now.
[02:30] And a lot of times people are like, OK, that's fine.
[02:33] And then internally, we also talk about this like,
[02:36] you know in RPG games, you have the main quest lines.
[02:40] And then you have the side quest lines.
[02:41] And we often talk about the companies
[02:43] like avoid the side quests.
[02:46] There is always ideas people have.
[02:48] And it's a good thing.
[02:49] And it's like people have ideas.
[02:50] But then it might be like, yeah, let's make this t-shirt.
[02:53] So let's make this thing.
[02:54] And then we're like, well, does it help the customers?
[02:57] Does it help the product?
[02:59] This sounds like a side quest to me.
[03:01] And basically it means we shouldn't do it.
[03:04] This doesn't progress the main quest line, which
[03:07] is building this product and making it awesome for these
[03:10] customers.
[03:12] So similar to me, it's like I operate this way
[03:14] personally, too, that I think about is this important
[03:18] for the main quest line in building this company for me?
[03:22] Or is this something that I can ignore for now?
[03:25] Or something that I can do later?
[03:28] And it makes more sense then.
[03:30] What is such incredibly good advice?
[03:32] Basically, ask yourself, how important is this to do now?
[03:36] And is this the main quest or is this a side quest?
[03:40] Amazing.
