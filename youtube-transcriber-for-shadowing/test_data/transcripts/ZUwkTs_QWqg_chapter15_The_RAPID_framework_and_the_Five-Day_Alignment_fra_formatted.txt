============================================================

To make sure that the ecosystem can run, let's talk about these two processes: Rapid and five-day alignment. They've both been around LinkedIn for a little bit, but they're great. The Rapid process addresses a common issue, especially if you're running two or three marketplaces with several different business models. The question often arises: who has the decision-making authority in this situation? Ensuring that you have a single person's name associated with the decision is really important because it brings clarity quickly.

I have a personal rule that I like to share: if you have three back-and-forths in an email, it's time to pick up the phone. If you've been on the phone for 20 minutes without resolution, it's time to write to that decision maker and move forward. The idea is that you should be able to reach a decision within an hour. It doesn't always work out that way, and I'm sure many PMs at LinkedIn might have some feedback on that, but that's the intent behind it.

Now, regarding the five-day alignment, you should hold your managers accountable to escalate and solve issues within five days. If they haven't been able to do so, that responsibility likely falls to the next level of management. As you navigate that ecosystem, the complexity can be overwhelming, which is why having these processes in place is essential to address some of those challenges.

I like the five-day rule because it essentially puts a time constraint on a manager to unblock issues. With Rapid, I'm not entirely sure I understand it. Is it an acronym for something, or does it simply mean making decisions rapidly? 

That's a great question. The "D" stands for decisions, while the "R" is for who is recommending it. The "A" indicates that a person at a certain level must agree, and the "I" is for others who may provide input. Essentially, it's a list of people who need to be part of the decision-making chain. However, I would argue that the most crucial aspect is having a single name on that decision line, as it typically ensures that you can reach a decision very quickly.
