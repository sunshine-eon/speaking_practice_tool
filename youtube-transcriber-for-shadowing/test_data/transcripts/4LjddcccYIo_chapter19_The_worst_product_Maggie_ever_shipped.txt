[00:00] that. So I love that you mentioned that and let's see what we can get into. But I guess
[00:07] maybe before I get there, is there an example of something that didn't go right just along
[00:11] the lines of some sort of failure slash mistake?
[00:15] I might be foreshadowing, but a question I ask in every product interview is, what's
[00:19] the worst product you ever shipped? And that's because I don't think you're a good
[00:25] PM if you haven't shipped something that's really shitty. Like you just haven't had
[00:28] enough reps, you haven't done it enough time. And it's not only that you've done it,
[00:33] but that you can admit it and you know which one it is. That's so important. And I
[00:38] remember what was so dumb. I'm still so mad about this, that we did this. I won't
[00:46] name which team, which company. I'm not going to call that out, but we decided we
[00:50] needed to do a rewrite, red flag number one of existing products and engineer who
[00:56] had worked with many times. We had a really good relationship. And this person
[01:00] was like, yeah, it's going to take six months. No problem. Core part of the
[01:04] product been around for forever. Like one of those things that the code is still
[01:09] the code written by the founders kind of thing. It didn't take six months. It
[01:13] took two and a half years. It still wasn't done. It almost never like it
[01:18] went on for so much longer than it should have. It took us forever to
[01:21] get to future parody. It was the worst project. Like so many people
[01:25] rotated in and out of it. Everyone thought it was dumb. Like sunk cost fallacy.
[01:29] Just the worst. And it's because, A, we got arrogant and we thought we could do it.
[01:36] B, we skipped discovery. We didn't really write a one-pager. We just went for it.
[01:42] We didn't do enough technical and design research into what the requirements
[01:46] would actually have to be. And there you have it.
[01:50] And then that worked out. Or was it a huge success in the end? And it changed
[01:53] the trajectory of the business. Absolutely not. But you know what? I
[01:56] didn't get fired. So like, it's fine. I feel like I've gone through those
[02:00] experiences. And then like three, four years later, it's like another maybe
[02:03] this rewrite and redesign may work. Because just we haven't updated this
[02:07] thing in a long time. Just don't do it. Don't rewrite. If anyone ever
[02:10] tells you to do a rewrite, don't do it. A side-by-side rewrite. Nope.
[02:15] Yeah. I've never had a like what I run into is once you get too far down
[02:18] a redesign slash rewrite, everything's building in that new world. And then
[02:22] you launch it and the experiment's negative. And then it's just like, Oh,
[02:24] we just got to launch it. We're going to claw back. We're going to get to
[02:27] figure out how to get back to neutral someday. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:31] Don't do. Good times. Okay. Well, maybe we'll start a failure corner.
[02:35] That could be a new segment. You may have a little sound and
[02:39] theme music. But this time we have a contrarian corner. And you
[02:44] have a couple contrarian opinions about a couple of topics. The
[02:47] first is product management.
