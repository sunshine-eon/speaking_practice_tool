============================================================

[00:00] for lofty goals, Brian was famous for going into meetings
[00:03] where people present their goals and their plans.
[00:05] And he's like, how do we 10x that?
[00:08] What do you need in order to 10x that goal?
[00:10] And then that ends up being your goal.
[00:12] And often worked shockingly,
[00:14] sometimes burnt a lot of people out.
[00:16] How do you think about just finding that balance?
[00:18] And I don't know, is there an example
[00:19] of just like, here's a really ambitious goal?
[00:22] Or maybe the question is just how do you find
[00:23] the balance of ambitious, but not just like impossible?
[00:26] So the first thing is, we have market comparables,
[00:32] which is very exciting for us.
[00:33] So when you look at bill.com, right?
[00:36] They're a publicly traded company,
[00:38] expensified public and traded or concur or Koopa.
[00:40] These are all like large players
[00:42] that are actually very motivating
[00:44] and largely de-risk some of the business decisions
[00:47] you're making.
[00:49] That's existing markets.
[00:50] We've also been able to create markets.
[00:52] Spend management was an actual market
[00:54] before we and other competitors kind of jumped into it.
[00:58] So that's what that's motivating.
[00:59] Go attack that market and go drive that revenue
[01:02] is very motivating.
[01:04] We also use designs as a way to motivate teams.
[01:09] So we spend a lot of time with designers
[01:13] crafting out what the future of this thing could look like.
[01:17] And that's also extremely motivating.
[01:18] So we constantly go back to these cornerstone,
[01:21] loom walkthroughs of Figma prototypes
[01:25] that designers spend a lot of time talking through.
[01:27] And I think that's a big part of the motivation.
[01:30] And so both of those things combined,
[01:31] I think helps us stay motivated.
[01:33] I think there's a constant pushback to like,
[01:36] okay, what can we actually achieve?
[01:38] But you're able to move super, super fast
[01:40] if you have those two things in mind,
[01:41] the market and the revenue goal.
[01:43] Cause we're very revenue driven as a company
[01:45] and the designs that can really keep you anchored on
[01:50] what this could look like.
[01:51] I know another important ingredient to how you operate
[01:54] is you really like to empower products.
