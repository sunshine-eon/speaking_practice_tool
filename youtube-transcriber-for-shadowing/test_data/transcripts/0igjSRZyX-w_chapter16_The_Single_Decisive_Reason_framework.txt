============================================================

[00:00] And one more nugget. Okay. I'm glad we have time for this. So you sure that you have this system internally, it's superhuman for making decisions. You call it single decisive reason.
[00:11] SDR. What is that?
[00:14] SDR is a thinking tool that I picked up from Reid Hoffman during my time at LinkedIn. And the idea here is that for important decisions, you should be able to identify one reason that on its own supports the decision.
[00:31] And it's based on the observation that all too often we rely on a collection of weak reasons to justify decisions. And it's very, very easy to do this.
[00:42] Imagine you're contemplating a decision, you write a list of the pros and the cons, there are three pros, but let's say there are 10 or 15 cons.
[00:51] The sheer number of cons, the effort of thinking them through the time it took to write them down is going to affect you consciously or worse subconsciously.
[01:00] And this is especially true, I've seen in group settings, which just in general are a little bit more risk averse and a little bit more consensus driven.
[01:08] So whenever anyone is making a decision.
[01:13] And they bring that decision to me, and they say, well, we want to do this because of XYZ and there are multiple reasons I asked them.
[01:20] What's the SDR? What's the single decisive reason? If they can't yet isolate it, that tells me they haven't yet figured out why they want to make the decision.
[01:29] It doesn't mean the decision is wrong. It just means that they haven't figured out the singular reason why we should do the thing.
[01:36] They can then go through their list of reasons and ask, is this alone enough to support this decision?
[01:42] Meaning if this was true and all the other things were not true, would I still do it?
[01:46] And sometimes we still do, but actually sometimes we don't.
[01:49] And we realize that a collection of weak reasons alone means that, for example, the outcome is less likely than we thought it was, or it was hiding a really strong reason on the other side of the decision.
[02:03] That is very cool. So this is just when someone comes to you with a decision, the way you use this idea is you ask them, what's the single decisive reason?
[02:12] Pretty much, yeah. And what they can't do, I mean, obviously this happens, people are human and natural, they'll usually start mentioning three or four things and that's fine.
[02:22] And then I will say, okay, but if only one of those was true and you're still advocating for this decision, what is it?
[02:29] And I think that's just a bar for a good decision.
[02:32] Why is that so important? Because you found that just like a bunch of low quality reasons just don't add up to a good reason to do something.
[02:42] Multiple reasons, which is ironic, but that's my SDR for why SDRs work, which is yes.
[02:49] Multiple low quality reasons rarely add up to a high quality reason to do something.
[02:56] But there are also other things as well, which is any decision you take has an opportunity cost, any feature you build is another feature that you didn't build.
[03:04] And if we're going to build this for a collection of weak reasons, whereas we could build that for one strong reason, I'd much rather build that for one strong reason.
[03:12] Now, this is all other things being equal and these things often end up being quite complicated, but you can apply SDR all the way down.
[03:19] I mean, you just did that to me. What's my SDR for SDR?
[03:22] There we go.
