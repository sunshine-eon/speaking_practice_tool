============================================================

Let's talk about the last part, which is the third point you made about carrying the water. I think that's how you described it. This one, there's no tips and tricks; it's just do the work. If you ever find yourself saying something like, "that's not my job," that's probably a thing you should do. And you know what? It probably isn't your job, and it probably is someone else's job. You can spend your life getting frustrated at that, or you can just get over it and get the work done.

People who are willing to just get the work done will move faster. Their products will be more successful, and they probably aren't carrying around all that anger and negative emotion. We touched on this earlier: as a PM, for better or for worse, and maybe this is not how we all want it to be, but you're oftentimes the emotional center of the team. It's your job to keep people motivated, keep them excited, and keep them bought into the project.

You just have to keep that optimism going, and it's hard work. It's really hard work to stay positive and to keep people amped for that thing. Part of it can be just like, "you know what? Let me take that on. Let me grab that whatever. I'll do this thing. I'll hop on the sales call. I'll implement this with the customer." You just have to do whatever it takes.
