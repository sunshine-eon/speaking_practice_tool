It's such an interesting list because when you ask most people what you need to get better at to become a great product manager, it's always communication skills, collaboration skills, vision, strategy. It feels like these are input metrics to what people normally think about. To me, communication is super important, as is analytical ability. The ability to look at a user experience component and understand if it's going to work, building up intuition around that, is also really important. These are the basics of the role—things that make you great at it.

Strategy, to me, is just one tiny slice of the role. Yes, it's important because you want to get your strategy right and need to pick the right products. However, it's only about 5% of the work that you do. At the end of the day, the person who has a good strategy will not be as successful as the PM who ships more stuff, gets more reps, and has the ability to actually create impact. You can be great at strategy, but if you're not good at executing and getting your stuff out the door, you're never going to be that great at the job.

Impact is another key aspect. Everyone talks about what makes a great PM—oh, drive a lot of impact—but they never say how. It's like, cool, let's do a strategy and have impact. When I was starting off as a PM, I was hearing this advice and reading about it, and I was sitting there thinking, awesome, I want to create impact. But then I looked at my job and thought, now what? Yes, impact—let's do it. But where is it? How do I find it? Someone help me.
