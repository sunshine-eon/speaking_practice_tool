Chapter 1: Introduction to Dmitry and Revolut
Video: How Revolut trains world-class PMs: The “Local CEO” model, raw intellect & building wow products
Time: 00:00 - 03:41
============================================================

Everyone is striving for talented, skillful, smart people. Revolute values way more raw intellect and this unquenched hunger to build things rather than experience. I hear one of the ways you approach early products differently is you guys invest a lot in actually making it good. It's not getting traction. Is it because the underlying idea is wrong or maybe your product just sucks? By forcing everyone to build a product that people will love, we kind of cut out this part of uncertainty. We can cut down the product in terms of functionality to just the most critical features, but we will never compromise on the quality, UX, and aesthetics.

Is there anything that you figured out about just how to set up new products for success? If something is 99% done, it's closer to 0% rather than 100%. Today my guest is Dmitri Slakazov. Dmitri is the global head of product at Revolute, which is a finance super app offering customer savings and checking accounts, crypto, investing, joint accounts, and even mortgages. Not only was it last valued at over $60 billion, but in the research that I've been doing to see which companies hire and incubate the best product managers, Revolute was right at the top alongside Palantir and Intercom.

In our conversation, we dig into what Revolute has learned about producing and hiring great product leaders, including a focus on ownership, having people solve really painful and complex problems, while making the experience wow and lovable by users. We also discuss indexing towards hiring really smart and driven people early in their career, versus people with a ton of experience in the space.

It's because they hire the best people and they build incredible products. You probably know them for their payments platform, which powers my newsletter, and also companies like NVIDIA, Salesforce, Zoom, and DoorDash. 

What you may not know is that they have several other products that can help accelerate your revenue, such as Stripe Billing, which powers billing for companies that you may have heard of, like OpenAI, Anthropic, Figma, Atlassian, and over 300,000 other companies. Stripe Billing lets you bill and manage customers however you want, from simple recurring billing to usage-based billing to sales-negotiated contracts.

There's also Stripe's Optimized Checkout Suite, which is a plug-and-play, super-optimized payment flow that natively supports over 100 global dynamic payment methods. Additionally, there's a product called LINK, which is an accelerated checkout experience built specifically to increase your checkout conversion. Every single one of the Forbes top 50 AI companies that have a product in the market today use Stripe to monetize it. Half of Fortune 100 companies use Stripe.
