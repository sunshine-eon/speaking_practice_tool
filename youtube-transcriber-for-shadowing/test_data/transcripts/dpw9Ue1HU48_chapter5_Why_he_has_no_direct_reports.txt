============================================================

[00:00] Let me go in a slightly different direction.
[00:02] We talked about how you have no direct reports.
[00:04] You've never had any direct reports.
[00:06] I know that's somewhat related to a piece of advice you often share,
[00:09] which is to lean into your strengths
[00:11] and to not do things that you're not amazing yet.
[00:13] So can you just talk about why this is the case?
[00:16] So why don't you have any reports
[00:18] and then this idea of just strengths
[00:21] and the importance of focusing on strengths?
[00:23] Yeah.
[00:24] I'll tell you the quick story as to how this came about.
[00:27] My co-founder and I had the kind of founding meeting for HubSpot.
[00:31] This is the week where we've decided we're going to do this
[00:34] and then we have this list of questions
[00:36] or topics for the kind of founder's discussion.
[00:39] One of them, and I think I've published a list,
[00:42] these are the questions all co-founders should ask each other
[00:45] in that kind of early period.
[00:47] One of the ones is like, okay, well, who's going to be CEO?
[00:50] This was an easy one because I had been CEO twice before
[00:54] and had figured out I'm not that good
[00:56] and actually suck at that.
[00:58] And one of the reasons I suck at that
[01:00] is that part of the CEO role
[01:02] is being good at managing people.
[01:04] It's not just about leading and having a vision
[01:06] of whatever you actually have to do,
[01:08] kind of the management as a craft.
[01:10] And so that part I already had in my head,
[01:12] I think Brian, my co-founder already had in his head
[01:14] that that's how this conversation,
[01:16] that was a very quick conversation.
[01:18] And in the moment, as soon as I had kind of had
[01:20] that wind behind me, it's like, okay, well,
[01:22] I don't want to be CEO.
[01:24] Because he'd never done it before.
[01:25] And like, okay, that was easy.
[01:26] And then I said, oh, and by the way,
[01:28] I don't want to have any direct reports.
[01:30] Just like popped into my head as an idea.
[01:33] I had not like pre-planned it or anything.
[01:35] And I sprung it on him.
[01:36] And the reason it's like, and it's like, okay, well,
[01:39] and the reason is because I have learned
[01:41] that I suck at management.
[01:43] I'm a reasonably smart person.
[01:45] I think I could become passively okay at management
[01:48] with some training, with some coaching or whatever.
[01:50] I don't want to spend any years of my life
[01:52] becoming passively okay at something.
[01:54] I would rather take those same calories
[01:56] and take the things that I'm good at that I actually enjoy.
[01:58] Those things are highly correlated.
[02:00] You tend to be good at the things you enjoy.
[02:02] You tend to enjoy the things you're good at.
[02:04] It's like so.
[02:05] And Brian was like, yeah, sure.
[02:07] And then I'm like, no, no, Brian, you don't understand.
[02:09] Because then I was like, there's going to be a time
[02:11] in the company was like, oh, our VP of engineering
[02:13] just quit like just be interim,
[02:15] something or whatever to have this team report to you
[02:17] until we find it's like, we're going to have those things.
[02:20] And you're going to have to promise me we're not going to do that.
[02:22] We're going to realize like I am not going to have direct reports.
[02:25] And we had that kind of heart to heart conversation.
[02:28] And it was one of the best decisions I've made
[02:32] both for myself and for HubSpot.
[02:34] Had I not made that decision, I'm a startup guy.
[02:37] I don't know that I would have survived
[02:39] at a company at HubSpot scale.
[02:41] And right now I can honestly say I'm having a better time
[02:44] at HubSpot.
[02:45] Now it's 7,000 people that I was having at 70 people.
[02:49] And the reason is I get all the upside of scale,
[02:52] which is I can make big bets.
[02:53] We can have long-term things and plans,
[02:55] whatever and plan for global domination
[02:57] without the downsides of scale, which is, oh,
[03:00] you're having to manage all these people
[03:02] all the kind of mechanics.
[03:03] And that's hard, right?
[03:04] It's a hard scale to have.
[03:05] I appreciate other people that have it.
[03:07] I don't.
[03:08] And so I get all the upside with very little of the downside
[03:10] of scale.
[03:11] And that's what kind of keeps me engaged and energized
[03:13] and happy at HubSpot.
[03:15] So I think it's been both productive for HubSpot
[03:17] and good for me.
