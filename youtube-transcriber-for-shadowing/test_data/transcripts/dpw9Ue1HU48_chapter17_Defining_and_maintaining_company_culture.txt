============================================================

[00:00] Okay. Let's talk about culture. I know you spent a lot of your time on helping build HubSpots culture, create the original culture.
[00:08] You created this epic culture code deck. I think it's 128 pages.
[00:13] So maybe just to dive into it, what was that process like to define the culture of a company and maintain the culture over time?
[00:22] I'll say awful.
[00:25] Okay. So I'll give you a very quick story because my co-founder and I were having a lot of our founders' meetings, our founders' dinners, as we do.
[00:33] And he had been meeting with his CEO group and he said, oh, Dermash, I hear this culture thing is really important.
[00:40] By the way, the word culture had never been mentioned prior to this conversation, the halls of HubSpot like ever.
[00:45] And this was how many years in?
[00:47] This is, I would say, three or four years in.
[00:51] I can check the records.
[00:53] Because by the way, even like Brian and I, even back when people were kind of offices, most of our communication was over email and async.
[00:59] We've always been big believers in that kind of written form.
[01:02] But anyway, so I can tell you whether the word culture was used or not.
[01:08] And it was not.
[01:10] And he's like, oh, I've heard, because you need to talk to the CEO, culture is super important.
[01:16] Dermash, can you go do that?
[01:19] I'm like, okay, Brian, like all the people and all the companies, like I am like, literally, like the bottom decile, if not like the worst possible person is not that.
[01:31] I don't like people. I just don't like being around them a whole lot.
[01:34] And from what little I know of culture, it sort of involves people, right?
[01:37] Like that, you know, I don't know, but it seems like I'd be the wrong person.
[01:41] But anyway, I'm a team player.
[01:43] I'm like, okay, it does feel like it would be important.
[01:46] And so I took on the task.
[01:48] And I didn't really know when he said, like, Dermash, can you go do that?
[01:54] Like, what does that mean?
[01:55] And so when I took it to mean, it's like, okay, well, like culture actually already exists.
[02:01] We have a culture.
[02:02] It's like whatever it is.
[02:03] And if working pretty well, companies doing well, people seem happy.
[02:07] And so I said, okay, well, what I really try to do is kind of describe the culture that's there.
[02:14] So it's not creating cultures, articulating the culture.
[02:16] So we know what it is.
[02:17] And so then this is the, you started me showing up again.
[02:20] So the question I asked myself is, I literally asked myself this question, which is,
[02:24] if I could write a Python function that would measure the probability of success of a new person coming into HubSpot,
[02:31] what would the factors be?
[02:33] What are the things that if I could measure, if I knew I had a true function that says, oh, on a scale of 0 to 10,
[02:38] here's how they rank on this and this and this and this and this and this.
[02:42] I could proximate how successful and how good they're going to be for HubSpot.
[02:46] That's my exercise.
[02:47] Okay.
[02:48] So I did an internal survey and I'll tell you why this was such an awful experience in the beginning,
[02:53] because this is also the story.
[02:55] So once I took on this task, I sent an email to the company.
[02:57] It's like, hey, everyone, I'm just going to be like digging into culture.
[03:01] So I'm going to send this kind of survey out.
[03:03] I just want to get an understanding so I can write.
[03:06] And the negativity and the visceral response to that one email was literally up until that point.
[03:15] It still ranks in top three, like worse things I've ever like, but that people felt so negatively and so strongly.
[03:24] And I was not expecting it, right?
[03:26] And I'll tell you the one line that really was gut-wrenching was like, Dermash, here we're talking about culture.
[03:36] Next, we're going to have posters up on the wall about excellence.
[03:40] HubSpot is not the company that I thought I joined.
[03:44] Like, oh, it's just like the big part of me is like, I just did not know how overloaded that idea of culture was, right?
[03:52] And so then when you dig into it, it's like, oh, because so many companies had done it so poorly and just didn't walk the walk or whatever.
[04:01] This is why.
[04:02] There was a reason why there was this kind of negative response.
[04:04] So anyway, so I went back to my thing is like, I get it.
[04:11] So I'm going to try to describe what we have and then write this truth function.
[04:14] So I wrote the slide deck, which had exactly 16 slides.
[04:18] And that answered this one question, which is, if I could write a Python code, what are the factors?
[04:23] So what are the attributes that we would look for in humans that and the reason I came up with that particular question is that I got this.
[04:30] When I did the survey, I did the NPF survey, which everyone knows that you would send to customers is like, oh, I want to feel zero to 10.
[04:37] How likely are you to recommend HubSpot as a place to work?
[04:41] And the other NPF question is like, why did you give that answer?
[04:46] As it turns out, here's the thing I learned, which was troubling.
[04:51] Everyone was happy.
[04:53] And the reason they were happy is because of the other people at HubSpot.
[04:57] That was the number one reason.
[04:59] Which is both good and bad.
[05:01] It's like, okay, well, that's awesome, but that doesn't tell me anything, right?
[05:04] Okay, well, that's like a self-reinforcing kind of recursive loop.
[05:08] And so that's what it's like, okay, well, what makes the people at HubSpot the people that are HubSpot?
[05:12] Let's come up with the attributes that define what it means to be one of these people that makes other people happy.
[05:18] And so we came up with the original kind of set of things that were embodying that slide deck.
[05:22] And I called that slide deck the culture code deck.
[05:25] And the reason I called it the culture code deck is not because it was a code of conduct or a moral code, or this is how a company should be run.
[05:31] It was because if I could write code to kind of define the culture of HubSpot, this is what the code would look like.
[05:37] And since that point, it's like the question I keep asking myself is if we could have an operating system that ran the company,
[05:44] it's the geeky part of me, not that you could do that, but what would that look like, right?
[05:49] And the big kind of unlock, there are very few original ideas I've had that are any good.
[05:57] One of them is this thing that culture is a product, period, and that every company builds two products.
[06:06] One is the product they build for their customers.
[06:08] And the other is a product they build for their team.
[06:11] That's what culture is, is the product you build for your team.
[06:14] And let's say we stipulate that that just happens to be true.
[06:18] Just humor me for a minute.
[06:21] If you assume that's true, then a bunch of things kind of follow from that postulate, right, that hypothesis,
[06:29] which is, oh, well, just like we would never build a product without talking to customers,
[06:34] we would never build a culture without talking to the customers of the product, which are the people.
[06:39] So we do a repeat of that original NPS survey we've been doing every quarter now forever
[06:45] to figure out what the NPS of that product is, our culture product.
[06:49] The other thing is like, okay, well, there's no product person in the history of humankind that would have said,
[06:54] oh, I built this product, it's awesome.
[06:57] I'm done.
[06:59] No one would ever say that.
[07:00] And this is the number one mistake I think I'm biased.
[07:05] I think founders make is that they say, oh, we have an awesome culture and my job is to preserve the culture.
[07:13] That is not the job because the needs of your customers change.
[07:20] The needs of the employees change, right?
[07:22] The culture exists to help the great people do great things for the company.
[07:26] That's why the culture is there and the things they need later as a company scales are different.
[07:31] And so just like you would never freeze the lines of code of a product,
[07:34] you would never freeze the lines of code of a culture.
[07:36] Culture should be iterated on just like you iterate on product.
[07:40] And there's so many other things that kind of fall.
[07:42] So just like in a product, you will get feedback from the customers like, oh, here are the bugs.
[07:47] And we actually call them bugs.
[07:48] It's like, oh, here are the bugs in the culture.
[07:50] And we have the all hands meeting.
[07:51] So we have the survey comes back once again to transparency notion.
[07:56] Every single survey response.
[07:58] It's anonymous in terms of who submitted it.
[08:00] We publish it, right?
[08:01] The quant score, the subjective thing, everything.
[08:03] And then we will categorize it and we will then have the next all hands meeting.
[08:08] We call them all minds.
[08:10] Anyway, all minds.
[08:15] And it's like, okay, so here are the things that we heard just like we would do for a product meeting.
[08:20] It's like, oh, we just the customers like, here's what we're hearing back.
[08:22] It's like, here's a bug that you've identified.
[08:24] Here's the ones we're going to fix.
[08:26] And when we're going to fix them, we're going to commit like, oh, like you said this was broken.
[08:30] Okay, we're going to, we're going to do something about that.
[08:34] Here are the things that like, yeah, I know you don't like it that way,
[08:37] but work says design, which we do in product all the time, right?
[08:40] Like, and you should have the right to do that.
[08:42] It's like, yep, some people are going to disagree.
[08:44] And there may be any number of reasons why we think that needs to stay the way that we're not saying necessarily forever.
[08:49] But as it stands, we are not prioritizing this.
[08:51] We are not fixing that thing that you think needs fixing for whatever reason.
[08:55] So the one lesson here is very few things I've learned that I think are universally applicable.
[09:01] That one, I think is right.
[09:04] And just so much brightness and goodness falls out of that is if you think of the people as customers,
[09:09] if you think of the culture as product, it takes away this kind of abstract nature of working on culture.
[09:15] And then it takes away this thing that I heard this back in the early commentary.
[09:19] It's like, oh, well, culture is not something you really build because that seems fake.
[09:24] That seems inauthentic that you just go, it's like, oh, we're going to craft this culture.
[09:28] No, we craft in the same way.
[09:31] I'm not saying we're going to impose it.
[09:33] We're going to do this off in isolation, but we're going to work on it.
[09:36] And it's something you actually do manifest.
[09:38] And it's not just up to the founders.
[09:41] Wow, what an amazing story.
[09:43] You're definitely getting laughs per minute for me.
[09:45] I think there's at least one laugh per minute so far in this podcast.
[09:47] That's amazing.
[09:48] And I think this point you just made about your job is not to preserve the culture as a leader.
[09:53] I think that's really profound because I think most people don't think that.
[09:57] They think their job is we need to maintain our culture as we grow.
[10:00] It's all fading away.
[10:01] Our culture is changing.
[10:02] But your point is that's good and that's great.
[10:05] Bringing it back to product.
[10:06] I think this is an important thing.
[10:08] This is the second-order lesson alert after you start with the culture as product,
[10:12] is that one of the challenges almost everyone will deal with is that you have these things.
[10:18] And so by the way, just because culture as product does not mean there's not a sense
[10:22] of having what some might label as core values.
[10:25] Because we have this in product as well.
[10:27] There are core values that the product believes in.
[10:29] We believe in about our product that we're going to kind of hold constant through it.
[10:33] We're building for SMB.
[10:34] We want it to be easy to use.
[10:35] There's constraints that we put on ourselves that are intentional that even though we iterate,
[10:39] we're not going to iterate away from these things that we just let kind of that high conviction back thing again.
[10:44] But not everything that's part of your product is a core value.
[10:49] So not everything that was part of your culture in the earlier.
[10:51] So transparency is one that has endured over a long time as part of our core value.
[10:56] And we preserved it even though it was troublesome through the IPO.
[11:00] I shared that story.
[11:01] And then there are things that we changed that were part of like,
[11:03] oh, we believe this meritocracy thing in a flat organization.
[11:06] But the manifestation of that was a bud with the lack of titles.
[11:09] And so we changed that.
[11:10] It's like, OK, well, there are things.
[11:12] And here's the other thing that is a mixed metaphor problem.
[11:16] And it will come with a good metaphor yet.
[11:18] There will be things that you have that are kind of core.
[11:23] And the way I describe it right now, I'm just going to put it out there.
[11:26] I'm taking myself for not coming up with a better metaphor.
[11:29] That is like federal versus state law.
[11:32] All right.
[11:33] So there are federal laws, right?
[11:35] We have here in the United States that says, OK, here are the things.
[11:39] And these are the inalienable rights of all citizens of the United States.
[11:42] And these are the things that are core.
[11:44] But then we have state things, right?
[11:46] It's like, oh, for this particular state on these particular aspects,
[11:49] they can kind of optimize for their particular state.
[11:51] It's like, yes, we understand like this is the goal, really.
[11:54] But for RC, we're going to do this.
[11:55] So we have something similar at HubSpot.
[11:57] We have a core set of things that are kind of part of the culture,
[11:59] part of the thing is like, OK, here's what we believe.
[12:02] And then there are things that the individual group.
[12:05] So our head of engineering can come back.
[12:07] It's like, yeah, I know our overall, like the founder's leaning is X.
[12:11] But for my particular group, that doesn't really make sense.
[12:14] We're going to do this.
[12:15] So one of the core things from the early years of HubSpot is like,
[12:18] we don't care about what hours you work, like from what time to what time.
[12:22] It's like, it doesn't matter.
[12:24] Like literally, it doesn't matter.
[12:25] And we didn't track it.
[12:26] We don't care.
[12:27] But then over time it's like, well, we have a support organization.
[12:30] And that organization, as it turns out,
[12:32] it does matter to our customers, right?
[12:33] Like we need to have coverage and things like that.
[12:35] It's like, OK, well, that sort of makes sense, right?
[12:38] But then you sort of have to kind of, they pick your battles,
[12:42] but then kind of fight back.
[12:43] For instance, transparency.
[12:44] There have been times where individual org leaders like, OK,
[12:48] Darmesh, I know you believe in this transparency thing
[12:50] and Brian believes in this transparency thing.
[12:52] But it's inefficient for someone that is a SDR
[12:55] in the sales organization to have access to the high order
[12:57] financials.
[12:58] It's a waste of time.
[12:59] It's a distraction.
[13:00] That was the argument.
[13:02] It's like, you may be right.
[13:04] But the binary decision, the fact that we value transparency
[13:07] so much, we're going to, yes, maybe it is a distraction.
[13:12] Fine.
[13:13] And the other one is like, oh, I don't want my team to have it
[13:16] because I just don't, you know, we were hiring so fast
[13:19] and it's like, and once again, that's a lot of trust to put
[13:22] into people or whatever.
[13:23] It's like, yeah, but then this is one of the other lessons
[13:25] is cultures over time become self-fulfilling prophecies.
[13:30] Is that so?
[13:31] I mean, the early Alice, the big lesson learned.
[13:35] So when I put the first version, the public facing version
[13:38] of the culture code out there, and I got feedback
[13:41] from the team and like, you say this in the culture code deck
[13:46] and it's just not true.
[13:47] It was not true enough for us to kind of like state that as a
[13:50] thing.
[13:51] And so the thing that I did is in the deck, I have what I call
[13:55] these little liner notes.
[13:56] It's like stuff going on right.
[13:57] It's like, oh, this is not really true yet.
[14:00] So it's more of an aspiration.
[14:01] This is how we want it to be.
[14:03] But we're not walking the walk yet on this thing.
[14:06] So I didn't take it out because I wanted to be an
[14:08] aspiration.
[14:09] And I had not thought it through.
[14:10] I cannot take credit for it.
[14:12] What happened over the full list of time is that those
[14:15] things that were aspirations became increasingly true by
[14:18] virtue of being in the deck because as people join, it's
[14:21] like, oh, that's the thing we aspire to.
[14:23] So I'm going to pretend like that's actually the culture
[14:26] of HubSpot, which is exactly what we want.
[14:28] So it's okay to say things that are aspirational.
[14:31] Just call them out.
[14:32] Don't present things that are not true, but back off of
[14:36] the things that you would like to be true.
[14:38] Wow, there's so many lessons there.
[14:40] It reminds me at Airbnb, actually, I was there when
[14:42] they created the original, there's these six core
[14:44] values of Airbnb.
[14:46] One of them was Simplify, turns out.
[14:48] And then, I don't know, some number of years later, the
[14:51] founders realized, we're not actually good at this.
[14:53] And value should reflect who you are, not who you
[14:56] aspire to be.
[14:57] And I like this middle ground you found of like, I'm
[14:59] going to put in here, but I'll note this isn't
[15:00] necessarily who we are.
[15:01] We didn't do that.
[15:02] That would have been a smart move.
[15:03] So they removed that core value.
[15:05] They're like, we're not actually this.
[15:07] And it's going from six to four.
[15:09] There's another one they removed.
[15:11] So I was really impressed because you're like, okay,
[15:13] wait, because it comes up in meetings, they're like,
[15:15] Simplify.
[15:16] No, it's actually really complicated.
[15:18] Yeah.
