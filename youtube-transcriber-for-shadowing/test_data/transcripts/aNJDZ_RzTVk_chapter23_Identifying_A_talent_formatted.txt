The designers are your plus. Somebody listening to this may be wondering, "Are my engineers a plus or not?" What comes to mind as ways that you could get a sense of this is whether you have a team that can operate effectively or if you need to shift the way you work or consider working somewhere else. 

Great question! It's very hard to identify. A few things come to mind. One is: does the engineer want to win in the market? Do they really care about winning against competitors and winning the hearts and minds of the customer? Do they understand the business context in which they operate and the need to achieve that? Are they curious about how the company makes money, what customers love and don't love, and what the most important project is and why it's important? Are they asking you questions about the business outside of just the engineering domains?

Additionally, are they able to execute on what they said they would without your help? Or do you feel like you need to be behind them? Are they the ones actually setting the pace, asking you to keep up with your specs and decisions, and responding more quickly to the things that are blocking them? Are they bringing in more PMs or designers to do more things? 

Proactiveness is key. For example, we have different Slack channels with a bunch of people sometimes asking questions or raising issues. You have engineers who jump in, explaining how a feature works, getting feedback, and fixing bugs proactively. You might think, "That's not the priority; I need to control what the engineers are doing." But that's not your job. Your job is to ensure they're aligned with the long-term vision and can deliver what they've committed to. Beyond that, they can take initiative as they see fit. If they take on something that puts their commitments at risk, they'll communicate that.

So again, that proactiveness, that desire to help, that accountability regarding their product—if their product isn't performing or has feedback, are they addressing it themselves, or do they need you to push them? These are all mentality and culture aspects. I'm not even getting into the technical rigor, the quality of their systems, or the velocity of code, as that's not really my role. But those are the things I would immediately look at, which I think are fundamentally different in the engineering team we've built at Ramp compared to others. It's a big part of the culture shift we've been able to create.

That's an awesome answer! As a PM, you often don't want your engineers and designers to have such strong opinions and to be so on top of everything. There's a tendency to think, "Oh no, here's what I think we should actually do." But engineers have all these opinions, and what you're saying is that you want to lean into that, assuming you trust they know what they're doing and can actually get things done. 

It's kind of a catch-22, but I think that's a really unique culture and approach. There are drawbacks, of course, where you get to a radically empowered engineering team that thinks they know the product better than the designer or the PM and may push back on designs or disagree with the PM. But I'll take that culture any day compared to one where they just take things at face value, not challenging the thinking or considering their own perspectives. 

I would much prefer someone on my team who challenges what I tell them to do or what I think is important. It may be a bit harder to manage, but it will make me think much deeper about what I'm asking of them and what I believe is important. I'll grow as a manager much faster because of that.

I have two final questions. One is around hiring. When you're interviewing people, what do you look for? What does Ramp look for that maybe other companies don't value as much as they should or perhaps overvalue? What do you think is unique that helps you hire this A-plus team?
