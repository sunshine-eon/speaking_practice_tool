============================================================

[00:00] Um, you know, like I think we have fairly limited time in our careers, right?
[00:06] Like, and, um, our careers are not that long at like, uh, like it's, you know, if you're,
[00:11] if you're lucky, you have 40 years in industry, um, um, um, most people spend more time in
[00:16] school and then like maybe leave later if they, uh, if, if, if they're so lucky that
[00:21] I can.
[00:22] So it's not even bad.
[00:23] I think you want to do the maximum amount of things you can be proud of at the
[00:27] end of your career.
[00:28] And you look back, you want to be saying like, Hey, holy shit, we shipped this thing,
[00:31] which was absolutely like an incredible contribution to a mission I cared about at a
[00:35] company that, uh, was full of other people who cared as much as I did, um, and probably
[00:39] now, uh, uh, at my vintage, uh, sitting and looking back and also are very proud of
[00:44] looking and maybe even thinking of looking with me and being, uh, really, really glad
[00:49] that we, uh, spend time on projects together.
[00:53] And so it's like, um, yeah, none of this happens if like everyone's sort of optimizing
[00:58] the thing that probably shouldn't be there.
[01:00] Right.
[01:01] So, and, uh, you know, therefore I think it's the better thing to do.
[01:04] There's another example along these lines that, by the way, I love this way of
[01:07] describing of compressing it in time to just make a decision and not focus on making
[01:12] it come across the most kind, nice, this kind of sweetest way.
[01:16] Something else I heard along these lines is just when, uh, when you give feedback
[01:20] to people when something is not, uh, the way that you think it could be or as good
[01:24] as it could be.
[01:25] It's often very direct and, uh, often hard to hear.
[01:29] And again, to me, this comes across as you're trying to maximize their potential.
[01:33] You're trying to push them to do something better.
[01:35] Is there anything there that you think is a way of approaching feedback?
[01:38] I really, really, really think that there is not a single person on this planet
[01:43] who is even close to, um, uh, being at their maximum potential.
[01:50] Like I just think everyone is like way, way, way, way, way better than they think.
[01:55] And the reason why they're not performing at this level is a series of ideas, maybe
[01:59] certain approaches for cultivating our skills and our crafts that have not yet
[02:04] been discovered and therefore we could not take advantage of them.
[02:08] They often, it's honestly just like it's an environment that just narrows the focus
[02:14] on fairly unambitious things, at which point you get stuck competing with literally
[02:19] everyone else in the world because everyone's unambitious.
[02:21] And so, um, I have found that reminding people of their own potential constantly is
[02:27] actually a wonderful thing to do.
[02:30] And I have a history of being right about people's potential more than they are themselves.
[02:36] Like, um, um, now in a way, this dooms me fairly often to be disappointed, right?
[02:43] You know, in myself, by the way, I'm talking about myself here too.
[02:46] Like I think I have way more potential than what I bring to bear and I hate that.
[02:51] So like I'm trying to cultivate the skills that I need for tomorrow and, um, um,
[02:56] and constantly challenge myself.
[02:58] But like I'm harder on myself than on anyone else.
[03:01] And then I'm, uh, by some discount rate, um, uh, act equally to the people around
[03:06] me, um, especially the ones who just so obviously are brilliant.
[03:10] And so, um, spending time and longer time in careers with people and then holding
[03:17] them to a high standard, um, means that they accomplish very often things that
[03:23] just they didn't imagine they could.
[03:24] And it's, it's, to me, this is the most wonderful thing to see.
[03:28] And frankly, this is like a through line for all of my career because this is my
[03:31] product is that I, I, I want my product to cause people to be more
[03:36] successful than they thought they could.
[03:38] And in fact, become more ambitious about what they are building with their
[03:41] online stores and their businesses when they are actually initially set out to
[03:45] do, because something like this happened to me, right?
[03:47] Like I started a snowboard store at some point that I didn't set out to build
[03:50] Shopify, I built Shopify because, um, if you are.
