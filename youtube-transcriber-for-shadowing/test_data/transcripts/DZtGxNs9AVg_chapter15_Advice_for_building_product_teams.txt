============================================================

[00:00] You talked about this kind of on the same thread.
[00:02] You talked about if you were to start in a team,
[00:06] like a new product team today,
[00:07] say you were ahead of product somewhere
[00:09] or ahead of RPM VP of product somewhere,
[00:12] building a new product team, scaling a product team,
[00:15] what would you do going forward that's different
[00:19] from what people have done in the past
[00:22] in terms of who you're hiring,
[00:24] how you're structuring them, that kind of thing,
[00:26] just like what do you think people should be thinking
[00:29] as they build product teams going forward,
[00:31] knowing tools like lovable exist
[00:33] and all the other stuff that's going on.
[00:36] I mean, everyone should be excited about using AI.
[00:38] I think that's a pretty big one.
[00:41] And then the team working really well together
[00:44] is the one that you like to launch.
[00:46] You have to like to sit down and solve problems together.
[00:52] You should, at the bottleneck for most products these days
[00:58] is not going to be as much on the engineering
[01:01] but having good taste, good intuition about your users.
[01:05] And that's, I mean, engineers and everyone preferably
[01:11] in the team should have that willingness at least
[01:14] to want to go through that motion and listen to the users
[01:17] and truly understand what they care about.
[01:23] What's kind of like the background
[01:24] of most of the engineers and people you've hired?
[01:27] Are they like, is there anything like in common?
[01:29] Are they just like super impressive humans generally?
[01:34] Like, you know, champions of programming contest,
[01:37] stuff like that.
[01:38] And like, what are some attributes
[01:39] of the folks you've hired so far?
[01:42] I think role cognitive capabilities,
[01:46] the strongest, like diamond,
[01:47] the strongest correlate of being at lovable.
[01:51] But there is this startup mindset
[01:56] I think is also very strong.
[01:58] Being a bit more, being much more interested in moving
[02:02] very fast and iterating fast
[02:05] than having like a lot of structure, a lot of process.
[02:09] And thinking about the business as a whole,
[02:12] more than thinking about my specific profession,
[02:14] my specific craft that I'm seeing myself
[02:17] like wanting to dig into on me.
[02:21] Amazing, okay, so smart, like very smart,
[02:24] entrepreneurial acts like an owner
[02:27] doesn't just like, this isn't just a job,
[02:30] but they feel like they actually have agency.
[02:32] Okay, this is great.
