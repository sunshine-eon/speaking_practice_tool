============================================================

[00:00] What's interesting about this is if you've heard the episode on Ramp and how Ramp builds
[00:05] product with Jeff Charles, there's such a different ways of building product.
[00:09] Ramp is all about velocity, shipping all the time, metrics, measuring everything.
[00:14] And your approach is almost the opposite.
[00:16] And I think what's interesting there as a takeaway is just there's many ways to
[00:19] do it.
[00:20] You just have to do it almost fully and you have to have really specific people.
[00:25] It feels like the people want to work in a certain way and a lot of it I think also is
[00:30] the founder has to be natural to the way the founder operates and thinks about building
[00:35] a company.
[00:36] Yeah, and for sure.
[00:37] And then if you look at successful companies and Amazon is very different than Apple and
[00:43] how they operate, then I think both of them are successful but not in the same way.
[00:48] So I think it's a decision you make as a company or as a founder, what kind of company
[00:53] you want to build.
[00:54] I do think there is some aspects of the domain that you're in.
[00:59] What does that domain and the problem space require from the company?
[01:04] And for us, I think it's like we are in the retention business and the trust business
[01:12] kind of that.
[01:13] Ideally, we have a company starting use linear very early on and then they stay
[01:18] with us forever.
[01:19] And I think the only way we can do that is we need to continuously deliver them
[01:24] good quality product and maintain that trust that we are, that we don't fail them or
[01:31] somehow otherwise mistreat them.
[01:34] And I think some businesses are much more transactional where it's like, yeah, we just need to
[01:39] make this e-commerce sale.
[01:41] And then once it's done, we don't care what happens.
[01:45] So in our case, it's more like we really need to build this relationship over time
[01:49] and then that's why I think some of the choices we make are also kind of like more
[01:54] about respecting the customer versus like we're just wanting to drive the revenue of the company.
[02:00] Awesome, such an important point.
