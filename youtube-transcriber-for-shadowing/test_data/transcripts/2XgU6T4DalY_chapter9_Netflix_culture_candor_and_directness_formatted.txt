============================================================

Back this gets into the second bucket. So giving feedback, being candid around your expectations, when they're not being met, what could be better in helping people improve, and be able to receive that type of feedback yourself in order to keep talent density high. 

Because no one comes to Netflix as a perfect human being and stays a perfect human being the whole time. We all have ways that we could grow and improve. And so in order to keep that bar high, you have to be willing to have those types of very uncomfortable conversations. It's an uncomfortable amount of candor and feedback in order to keep that bar high. 

And then the other piece of it is another thing that doesn't come naturally to humans, which is making a call in pretty timely fashion if someone's not able to meet the bar. To say either, I don't think the role you're sitting in is the right role or I don't think that Netflix is the right place for you. And to make that something that is part of best practice, to get to a point where you could make that decision.
