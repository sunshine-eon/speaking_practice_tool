============================================================

[00:00] constantly.
[00:01] So when Archie was on the podcast, he's the head of growth at Shopify.
[00:03] I don't know if that's, this official role basically drives a lot of the growth.
[00:07] He talked about how the core product team outside of the growth team operates without
[00:11] KPIs without specific goals and decisions are driven by taste and intuition, primarily
[00:17] you and Glenn and some other leaders.
[00:20] And a lot of people heard that and they're like, I first, I don't believe that second
[00:23] of all, how does one operate that way when there's no data to tell us exactly
[00:28] what is right and good.
[00:29] So the question I have is just how does one operate in that way successfully?
[00:32] Like what does it take for a company to work that way?
[00:34] Because a lot of people will try it and fail.
[00:37] This is very close to what I just talked about before overfitting, but Guthard's
[00:42] law is real.
[00:43] The moment you create, like it's moment a metric becomes a goal, it's no longer
[00:47] useful metric.
[00:48] Right?
[00:49] That's, I think more or less a precise wording.
[00:53] Why?
[00:55] No metric by itself is a complete heuristic for a complex business because
[01:03] business is complex.
[01:04] There's a million of different tensions in the company and you can't all keep them
[01:08] in harmony by optimizing for one thing.
[01:11] So it's true that we don't have KPIs and we don't have like at least OKRs in
[01:17] the sort of Silicon Valley sense, but we are extremely data informed.
[01:22] We have invested enormous amounts of money and like money and time into systems
[01:27] that like give us basically everything on our fingertips.
[01:31] I sometimes demo this to other founders and they're kind of like completely
[01:35] bowed over by the way we can dig into basically every constituent atomic
[01:42] bit part that makes up the cohort that just got formed 15 minutes ago by
[01:46] at the end of a quarter or month or week.
[01:52] And so it's actually that what Shopify attempts to do is to, and in a lot of
[02:03] different places, this is one of them, but also in its products, is just not
[02:08] overfitting for the quantifiable because I think there is, like again,
[02:11] this is one of those things, everyone competes for everything that's
[02:13] highly quantifiable because it's like it's kind of fun.
[02:20] It's like a game.
[02:21] It's like you tweak a number and 0.1 more is better than 0.1 less.
[02:26] And so that's an immediate gratification thing.
[02:31] But I just think the overlap of most valuable things you can do with a
[02:35] product and the things that happen to be fully quantifiable is like maybe
[02:39] 20%, which leaves 80% of the value space unaddressable by the people who only
[02:44] look at the quantifiable things.
[02:46] So what actually happens is Shopify is comfortable with the
[02:50] unquantifiable things such as tastes, quality, passion, love, hate.
[02:58] Like it's like with the strong emotions that people have, the sort of
[03:04] deep satisfaction that a crafts person feels when they've done a
[03:08] job well is actually better proxy if you allow it to be than the unit test
[03:16] pass.
[03:17] The unit test might not pass and the unit test will pass 15 minutes later
[03:21] because we fix them or adjust the one or two things so they support us.
[03:28] The growth numbers we're looking for, we have systems that tell us
[03:31] exactly if something goes the wrong way.
[03:33] There's an extremely sophisticated rollout system in Shopify that
[03:37] forever holds out and correlates everything in every experiment and so on.
[03:43] But we think about it as a cockpit for a pilot.
[03:47] And the decisions are still made by pilots and we think this leads to better results.
[03:53] It's just like the same with our product.
[03:57] We also ask people to just like not like there's plenty of A-B testing
[04:02] tools and all these kind of things for commerce.
[04:04] And it's of course like really important to figure out what the conversion rates
[04:06] are, but are you representing your brand as an unquantifiable question?
[04:10] Are you proud of the thing that you have built?
[04:12] Are you, do you feel it's your own, right?
[04:16] And so I think there needs to be more acceptance in businesses of unquantifiable things.
[04:22] One of the most powerful thing, the most powerful unquantifiable things
[04:28] in the world of business are fun and delight.
[04:34] If people have fun when they're doing something,
[04:38] that is just upstream from so, sorry, downstream from so many other things.
[04:42] Like I think that if all the metrics are pointing down, but everyone says,
[04:49] my God, I'm having so much more fun, I think that the very next thing
[04:54] that will happen with some time delay is all metrics will start going up.
[04:58] And so I think that is, and if that doesn't happen, then we adjust course.
[05:03] And then the reason why we specifically don't have OKRs and these kind of things
[05:06] is because if you want to hold the unquantifiable as things that are stable
[05:11] and exist, like that people actually do really defer to them
[05:16] and really actually learn to be OK with someone just saying,
[05:20] hey, this is actually just like really great and we're shipping this,
[05:23] then you need to make certain edits to the business
[05:28] that don't remind everyone too much of the companies they might have come
[05:31] from which the only way to get promoted is by driving the metric up.
[05:35] So it's a bit of a more nuanced conversation, I suppose,
[05:39] maybe slightly less like good on the fortune cookies,
[05:42] saying like Shopify doesn't do OKRs or doesn't do metrics and so on.
[05:46] But it's actually just because the metrics take a support function
[05:50] where we often defer to just more, sometimes a little bit emotional,
[05:56] but like generally less quantifiable things.
[06:01] I imagine if someone were to hear you describe this of like focus on joy
[06:05] and fun and love and delight, maybe like it's easy to dismiss that.
[06:10] Like it sounds completely idiotic, right?
[06:12] Like, so this is a funny thing.
[06:13] It's like, it's like, again, there's an aesthetic in the world that exists,
[06:17] which is that business people dress in suit and tie.
[06:23] They are speaking much more sophisticated than I do,
[06:26] usually without an accent, have a full head of hair.
[06:29] They talk about metrics.
[06:32] They are in front of PowerPoint presentations.
[06:34] They usually have a stick and show dramatically at the pie chart that is behind them.
[06:39] And highly charismatic, highly like everyone likes.
[06:43] It's just like, so that's our aesthetic.
[06:46] How much is that aesthetic overlap with outperformance?
[06:52] I don't know, but some of them, some people put it off who are like this.
[06:54] But like, I just like, I think the world is sort of stacked to lead us astray
[06:59] based on our stories about what optimal looks like are just so incorrect.
[07:05] And so in so many ways, optimism always sounds done or at least naive.
[07:13] Passimism sounds extremely sophisticated, you know, metrics driven
[07:18] sounds extremely sophisticated.
[07:20] Talking about fun sounds like naive.
[07:22] It's just like I've at this point, like kind of learned to
[07:27] first of all, I've always kind of ignored, you know, what people think generally.
[07:32] That came pretty natively to me somehow, which I'm very lucky about.
[07:36] But I've now actually learned that
[07:40] almost all the alpha in the world is now in the
[07:43] exactly the things that are unobvious, but true.
[07:46] And the things that people dismiss as naive or so, you know, I mean, just
[07:52] like the most successful business person on bad earth is Elon.
[07:56] And he conforms to no idea of what like the most sophisticated
[08:01] business person ought to be like in any which way you can imagine.
[08:04] So it's I think we live in a world where the counterfactuals are winning
[08:09] because our like because aesthetics have
