============================================================

[00:00] It's an awesome example, kind of along the lines of that, but also this category of freedom
[00:06] and responsibility.
[00:08] Something Netflix innovated long ago, and I'm curious if this is still a thing, is this
[00:12] idea of chaos monkeys, which essentially are a program that runs on your infrastructure
[00:18] that just kills random processes and things and just to see what breaks and make sure
[00:24] things are stable when things actually start falling apart.
[00:27] Is chaos monkeys, was that what it's called in the end?
[00:30] Is that still a thing?
[00:31] Is there still some chaos monkeys running around the servers?
[00:35] Not unbridled chaos monkeys, no.
[00:38] Okay, it contains chaos monkeys.
[00:41] We carry too much responsibility, speaking of freedom and responsibility for the member
[00:46] experience to inject pain, though we do do a lot of experiments to test resilience.
[01:00] That does probably mean injecting things that we're not quite sure whether A is better than
[01:06] B. That happens across engineering systems really at scale, but it's not for pure chaos.
[01:15] It's for intentional learning, and so we can avoid making bigger mistakes.
[01:20] Then as we go into new efforts like Cloud Games, we have a beta that's out now, live
[01:27] would be another example.
[01:29] We do try to come up with intentionally low profile examples where we can test the bounds
[01:35] of our systems in a way that's unlikely to damage the member experience.
[01:42] That's less randomness more by design.
[01:45] We're doing that in a few places that feels mostly like good engineering practice, so
[01:49] we can understand when it's really showtime, and we're going to really test our systems.
[01:56] Will they be able to perform like we want them to?
[01:59] RIP chaos monkey.
[02:01] Yeah.
[02:02] Kind of along these lines of data, data itself has always been at the heart of Netflix, and
[02:11] my understanding is the way the data team and the insights team is structured has been
[02:16] one of the reasons Netflix has been so successful, and that's the team you led before you moved
[02:23] into this new role.
[02:24] Can you just talk about how these teams are structured and why this structure is so effective?
[02:29] Yeah.
[02:30] I certainly like to think of it as being special.
[02:33] It's unusual.
[02:34] I can explain why.
[02:36] So at the scale of company that Netflix now is, very often data-oriented teams are embedded
[02:47] in other parts of the business.
[02:49] So it could either be they're embedded in a business line like ads or games, or they
[02:56] are organized more functionally, separating data engineers from data scientists from analytics
[03:05] engineers from consumer researchers.
[03:08] And we've resisted that and kept a centralized team that is both functionally diverse, so
[03:15] across all those types of functions that I just described, and works on nearly every
[03:22] area of the business from within the team.
[03:26] And I sort of understand why a lot of companies move away from this, because it really does
[03:33] require basically extraordinary partnership.
[03:39] That we would have people working on data problems that don't report into the teams that
[03:43] are relying on them.
[03:46] But the benefit we get is we get to think about our functional expertise.
[03:50] So are we really world's best data engineers, world's best data scientists, and how do we
[03:58] continue to be ever better from a functional and technical perspective?
[04:03] It gives people better career paths, because there's more mobility across the teams.
[04:08] It feels like a team that has a functional expertise with a lot of different problems
[04:11] to solve.
[04:12] And so I think it enables more cross-pollination of ideas in a way.
[04:19] And it also allows us to be really objective.
[04:22] That is probably the most important thing, that our job is not to tell the story that
[04:27] someone wants to hear with the data, or to solve the problem that someone thinks is most
[04:33] important.
[04:34] It's for us to have our own perspective about things.
[04:38] And I think that that up-levels the whole organization, because it means that we're
[04:44] able to be truth-tellers or to be curious in a way that might not fit if we had a different
[04:52] organizational structure.
[04:54] We have to balance that.
[04:55] It would be a good partner to live around the things we agreed were priorities, be flexible
[05:00] without spending our time.
[05:02] But it gives us agency and responsibility beyond that.
[05:07] And I feel like the team takes that very seriously.
[05:09] So I've seen examples of that in how we bring data to a lot of spaces, including how we
[05:16] partner with engineering on data-related topics, or how we partner with content that
[05:20] I'm not sure we would have gotten to if not for having that kernel that's sort of a center
[05:24] of excellence around it.
[05:26] And it's data and insights.
[05:28] That was the team that you ran.
[05:30] Insights, is that describing user research, or what does that have function actually?
[05:35] So part of data and insights is a consumer insights team that includes a lot of different
[05:39] flavors of research, really.
[05:43] So in some ways, consumers even a misnomer, because there's parts of the team that do
[05:47] internal research, for example, on tools and products for studio productions.
[05:53] So that's more of a user research-oriented versus consumer.
[05:57] And then the parts of that team that are consumer-oriented do things all the way from content screenings
[06:03] to make titles, the best version of themselves before they're on the service, to more traditional
[06:09] UX research to think about how can we deliver the best title discovery experience, or how
[06:16] can we think about things that improve accessibility.
[06:20] And then that team has a global remit.
[06:22] So there's also teams that are more local or regional expertise in understanding consumer
[06:27] needs and entertainment.
[06:28] So consumer insights and a team formerly known as, still kind of known as as a shorthand,
[06:36] data science and engineering combined together to create data and insights probably about
[06:41] two years ago.
[06:43] That's another piece that's unusual.
[06:44] It becomes truly a full stack data and research expertise.
[06:49] And so we could tackle a problem like what's the right way to think about recommendations
[06:55] and how best to surface them in a way that combines attitudinal research, qualitative
[07:00] and quantitative with behavioral research on more of the data science, data engineering
[07:05] and analytics side.
[07:07] It's super cool because I think it's really rare that what people think of user research
[07:11] is within the data work.
[07:13] And I think that might be a solution to some of the backlash a lot of user research teams
[07:17] get where they're like, I don't know what are you guys doing all this anecdotal evidence.
[07:21] If it's under the same org, I feel like that leads to a lot more credibility and avoid
[07:27] this like data's telling me this thing.
[07:29] This user research team is telling you this thing.
[07:32] Yeah, I mean, consumer insights is one of the newer teams for me.
[07:38] It wasn't in my background to lead a team like that and not in my individual training.
[07:44] But they are critical for making sure we keep a consumer orientation, a member orientation
[07:50] on things.
[07:52] And I have loved to watch the teams collaborate on problems because it's we talk about it
[07:58] as a superpower internally and combining those skill sets.
[08:01] So I think the consumer insights team at Netflix has had a lot of credibility in a certain
[08:05] area of expertise and we took it to the next level by combining it with other of the functional
[08:10] expertise.
[08:11] So it's it's not required in every problem space.
[08:15] So we try not to overdo it and say we need to be collaborating everywhere because that
[08:19] just feels like the wrong expectation.
[08:23] But we try to make the most of it in spaces where we really benefit.
[08:26] So yeah, it's worked out.
