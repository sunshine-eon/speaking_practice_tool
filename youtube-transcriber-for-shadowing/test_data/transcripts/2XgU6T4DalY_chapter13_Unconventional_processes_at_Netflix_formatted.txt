This is kind of what you always hear from people giving founders advice: just hire amazing people, get out of their way, and let them do their job. However, this approach is often not a successful experience. What are some examples that come to mind? Either things that emerged from this freedom, such as products, features, or ideas, or policies and processes that you don’t have that everyone else might?

I know there's no vacation time; there's unlimited vacation time. I assume that’s still a thing? Unlimited vacation time? Okay, cool. Yeah. Alright, great. And then there are no performance reviews, as we discussed. So, I guess in either direction, can you provide an example of something that came out of this freedom or a process that would surprise people because you don’t have a framework or system?

We've been able to deliver, for instance, innovations in our content delivery network, innovations in encoding, or innovations in discovery and personalization. We're not driven by some leader saying, “I think this is a priority.” Instead, we are often driven by individual contributors who have great ideas for innovation. A lot of the success that Netflix has achieved came from creating space for people on the team.

There are probably thousands of examples of product features and other developments that arose from creating this space. Right now, the challenge is finding the sweet spot so that we can operate efficiently at this scale without stifling some of the core beauty of the culture.
