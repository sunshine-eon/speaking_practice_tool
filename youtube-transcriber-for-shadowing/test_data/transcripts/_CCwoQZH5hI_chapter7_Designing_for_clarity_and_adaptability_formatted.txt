============================================================

Okay, so I took us on a long tangent away from lessons and experiments you ran along the journey of iterating on the streak. A few things you've shared so far is that it started with this XP idea and then went to a lesson. You iterated on ways to make it simpler, maybe harder, and edited streak goals, where you commit to hitting a certain goal of streak. What else have you found that has worked or didn't work? What lessons have you learned?

Sticking with this one to seven days streak, the idea of a streak, particularly to this audience, is obvious—it's just counting how many days. However, we've realized over time that a lot of users do not understand how a streak works. It can be as simple as not understanding how streak freezes work. For example, my mom was talking to me the other day about how she didn't use Duolingo, but when she came back, her streak was still there. There are certain elements of the feature that we can do better at explaining. Even what a streak is—it's tracking how many days I've used the app. The more we can make the feature easily comprehensible to users, the more retentive it is.

We've run a number of experiments to address this. You asked about early easy copy changes that we made. My first win experiment when I joined Duolingo was when you start a streak; we had little copy at the bottom of the screen that celebrated you or gave you context. I ran some tests that tried to explain what a streak was in just eight words. That was it, and it was a massive win because it really clarified how the streak worked. It helped users understand what they needed to do.

This is something you have to constantly remind yourself of, especially if you work in tech and are building cool tech features. Your user base is not a bunch of tech workers. You need to think about who your audience is. For us, it's not just tech workers; it's people in America and all over the world of all ages and cultures. Making sure that even something as simple as the streak is understandable is critical.

What was the actual copy? Do you remember? It was something like, "Start a day to extend your streak, but miss a day and it resets." Makes sense. Very clear.

When you say massive win, just to give people a reference point, what does that look like? This was four years ago, but I think it was in the order of magnitude of over 10,000 daily active users for us. To provide some context, Duolingo really cares about the metric of current user retention rate. Our first-ever Duolingo post with Lenny was a newsletter that our former head of product wrote, Jorge. It remains the single most popular newsletter post of all time in my newsletter across 300. I highly recommend giving it a read.

To summarize, we found that if we wanted to drive daily active users, our growth north star is DAUs, and the metric that is most effective at driving DAUs is the current user retention rate. This is just users who are not new or resurrected, getting them to come back tomorrow. Most of the work that our retention teams do is focused on current user retention. The retention team that I lead focuses on this, and it just so happens that the streak is the best feature at driving current user retention. This experiment was the biggest current user retention win we had—one of the top three current user retention wins for us.

As I said, sometimes it's not the big beautiful feature that's going to drive huge gains. Sometimes it's just something as simple as a few words. When you mentioned 10,000 days, I think that references how you measure incremental impact and absolute numbers of new daily users attributed to that experiment. We do both. A lot of times, I look at retention metrics like day one versus day seven versus day 14. What I'm looking for is a better day 14 impact and better day one impact because it means users are retaining better over time.

This is particularly true for users that see a feature multiple times. I prefer absolute DAU numbers because, as long as you're controlling for different biases like recency or novelty bias, it's an easy way to have an absolute comparison. You start to look at percentage changes, and then it's influenced by your treatment—how many users saw the experiment. But at least an absolute number is easier to compare. There are pitfalls with it, but we find that it's a pretty useful way to approach experiments.

Quick tangent: if there's not an answer to this, no problem. Coming back to the idea of experimenting like crazy without creating a product that nobody wants to use long-term, is there an example of a positive experiment that you all decided not to keep in the product? Retention doesn't only work on the streak, although you would think we do most of our work on it. We've touched a lot of different surfaces over the years.

There was one experiment we launched regarding XP in the lesson. The only UI elements are a progress bar at the top and how many hearts you have, keeping it really simple. We decided to add XP in there to show your XP ticking up as you go through a lesson. The hypothesis was that it would make users feel good and show what they've earned, making them less likely to quit. However, we realized that it was distracting for users. The lesson is where users learn, and we had added something that could take away from that focus.

The question I had for my colleague was, "What else are you going to do with this? What's your iteration idea? Is this going to make the lesson experience more gamified?" We realized it was just an easy engagement idea, but we had touched our most sacred space in the app. It was a nice win, but we added that UI element, and at the time, it was less clear what we would do with it long-term. We decided to pause that and keep the lesson as a little bit of a learning sanctuary.

It's funny; nowadays, I think we have enough XP-based mechanics and fun things that could work in that context. But at the time, it didn't feel right to keep that around. 

The other thing I'll call out with the streak is that we have the image of the streak as this flame. It's important to acknowledge that it's a metaphor for a retention mechanic—the idea of keeping a flame lit. We've established the flame as a representation of a streak for many users, which is great. However, there are many people in different cultural contexts and stages of life where the idea of keeping a flame lit to show commitment makes less sense.

We did some user experience research in India many years ago, and this metaphor did not resonate at all there. This was a really interesting learning. The more global user experience research you can do to understand how users are actually experiencing your feature, the better. We redesigned the screen to focus on showing the number going up instead of the flame. 

As you're thinking about designing around a streak, don't get too caught up in creating a beautiful story at the expense of clarity. Make sure your product design is a clear distillation of what you're actually tracking. Form should follow function. 

Clarity doesn't have to come at the expense of delight. When you hit a milestone, Duo becomes a Phoenix and lights on fire. There are ways to make the experience exciting and celebratory without sacrificing clarity. You can do more delightful things for users who are deeper into their streak experience than for those who are just starting. 

For one-day streak users, your goal is to ensure they understand how the feature works. For example, we have a calendar at the bottom of the streak screen, and over the years, it has looked more and more like a calendar. The more we make it look like a calendar, the more people realize this is a daily mechanic. 

Think about the screen holistically and how every single element communicates the point of the feature and how it works.

I imagine one of the biggest wins was just giving people flexibility along the journey, like streak freezes. Is that a big vein of opportunity discovery? It is. Actually, I'm going to show you one of the most thoughtful gifts that anyone has ever given me. This is our Duolingo Streak Serenity Prayer, knitted by my colleague Antonia. It says, "Grant me the serenity to accept the flexibility I need, the courage to reach perfection when I can, and the wisdom to celebrate regardless." 

This idea of flexibility versus perfection and celebrating regardless is core to how we think about the streak. For us, it's very much a bend-not-break approach. If you're going to miss a day, I'd rather you come back with an intact streak than not come back at all. But if you don't have to miss a day, I'd much rather you use the app every day. That focus on flexibility has certainly been the biggest mechanic perspective win for us.
