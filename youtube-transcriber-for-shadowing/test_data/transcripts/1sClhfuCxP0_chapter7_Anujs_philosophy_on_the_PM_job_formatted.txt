============================================================

There's really an example of a phrase you found really effective in either Swiggy, Jupiter, Flipkart, or anything. Here's a really quick example of something that had a big impact on either simplifying the value proposition or, if you don't have an example top of mind, what was the impact you saw from implementing some of these ideas? 

I'm talking about a phrase that I'm now used with product managers a lot to kind of simplify how they should be thinking. I think one thing is, and that's not only for the consumers but even for how we operate. We are product managers, and we're in the business of influence. Users are doing something, and now we want them to do something else. Our engineers are doing something, and now we want to influence them into building something fast. Our leadership has some plans where we need to influence them to essentially look at a plan and, basically, sign off and do something else. 

We are in the business of influence, and you are doing this all the time internally; otherwise, you are not successful even in shipping. Now we have to extend this to our users and really think about it from that point of view. So, you are a full-stack influencer and not only an external influencer. You've got to think more like sales, more like marketing, more like influencers. 

One of the most important skills for product managers is influencing people on their team. I like the point that you're also trying to influence your user, and that's interesting. Just more reason to get really good at influence. 

I actually have a newsletter about how to get better at influence based on Frodo Baggins and Lord of the Rings. We'll link to that in the show notes.
