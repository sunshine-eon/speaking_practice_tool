============================================================

[00:00] Is there anything you've learned about just building a brand over the course of building
[00:03] linear, something you find to be really important in actually building that
[00:07] perception of linear is really great and amazing?
[00:11] To me, I think the brand should be always authentic.
[00:16] I think even people, if people can't articulate it,
[00:20] people start to feel like something is off. I think there can be companies or startups
[00:26] think about brands, like, oh, brand is the local or the colors of the website or something,
[00:31] and then they do the same thing and some other company does.
[00:34] And then they think, okay, now we have a brand.
[00:37] But you actually didn't think about what's your brand, what is the message or voice you want
[00:41] to talk about. And also, the brand doesn't happen overnight. So it's basically just,
[00:47] you start in the beginning, and when you start a company, you don't have no brand.
[00:52] And so you have to create it. And you create it over time by the things you do,
[00:58] the things you say, how you say them, and what kind of, how do you approach things?
[01:03] How do you treat customers? How do you build the website or the product?
[01:07] All of these things start to build this idea, what does this company mean to me in people's
[01:13] heads? I know we both work at the Airbnb, and I think Brian Chesky is, I think the brand
[01:18] was probably the most important thing for him. And I don't know how many hours or meetings or
[01:24] conversations there was about the brand. And it's like the brand was always like,
[01:28] it's like part of everything the company does. Because it's true, it's like, yeah, you could
[01:33] book things like places to stay in a lot of places on the web.
[01:38] But when people think about like, oh, I want to like stay in some cool place,
[01:42] they're going to think about Airbnb. It's like, they're not going to like think about
[01:45] those other places. So that's like the power of the of the brand to like people stop
[01:49] thinking about the other things or they start understanding like, okay, this is the thing for this.
[01:55] And it's part of the reason Airbnb has been able to build a direct
[01:59] destination where people aren't like Googling, I want to stay in a home that are like
[02:02] Airbnb.com, which gives Airbnb such a massive advantage, not having to run ads on,
[02:07] you know, Facebook and Google or SEO, it's just like people know Airbnb and they just
[02:11] go straight there. And there's very few sites where people go. Now I'm going to go straight
[02:15] there and look for some knowing that they can also compare hotels on all these other sites.
