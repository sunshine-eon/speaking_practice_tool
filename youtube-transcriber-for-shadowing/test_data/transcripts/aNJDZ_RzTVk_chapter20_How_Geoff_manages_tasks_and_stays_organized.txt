============================================================

[00:00] I'm not allowed to put that into meeting calendar invites
[00:02] anymore, but that actually worked really well.
[00:04] Nobody really booked meetings in that slot.
[00:06] And I didn't know Zoom had a slot feature
[00:08] that this community had.
[00:09] It was a Google, it was in the calendar.
[00:11] It was like the calendar invite.
[00:13] And I also worked usually at least one day a weekend.
[00:16] I found that to be really effective.
[00:17] And I know a lot of people don't want to be doing that.
[00:20] But I found that really important to have great success.
[00:24] One other question along these lines
[00:26] around just optimizing for processing
[00:30] and getting stuff done and deep work time.
[00:33] Do you have any other best practices
[00:35] for just being organized and staying on top of stuff,
[00:38] knowing that there's just stuff coming at you
[00:40] all day, every day?
[00:41] If you're a manager and like me, you're
[00:44] in back to back meetings from 10 to 6,
[00:47] it's very easy to be completely overwhelmed
[00:49] with a sheer amount of stuff you need to do.
[00:52] And so I've invested over time in just a very robust
[00:56] and fairly simple test management process,
[00:58] which is at the end of every meeting,
[01:01] I would write down the tasks that I owe
[01:04] and the tasks that someone else owes.
[01:05] And I would write them down to as clearly as possible.
[01:09] Not like some vague thing, but a very clear thing.
[01:12] And just like when I need to get this done by.
[01:16] I don't spend time just grooming.
[01:17] So at the end of the day, I use notes.
[01:20] I have just a page long thing of all the things
[01:22] I need to get done, all the things people
[01:24] need to get done for me.
[01:26] And then I spent time grooming,
[01:28] which is basically just trying to group things together
[01:29] in like logical chunks,
[01:31] grouping the tactical versus the strategic,
[01:33] the important versus the less important.
[01:35] I group also what other people owe me
[01:37] and I slack them when they owe me.
[01:39] And that put a reminder on Slack for like,
[01:42] when they owe it to me by.
[01:43] And that was just out of sight, out of mind.
[01:45] I think that the high level theme is
[01:49] I try to create or free up a headspace
[01:52] for processing not memory.
[01:54] And so I just basically spend very little time
[01:56] memorizing anything and I write everything down.
[01:59] That is hard when you're trying to remember a specific date
[02:02] or remember something that someone said,
[02:05] but you have a system by which
[02:06] you can pull these things up very, very quickly.
[02:08] In the Google space, you can pull up any document
[02:11] and search a bunch of documents very, very quickly.
[02:14] So that's what I would do is
[02:17] just spend a lot more time on the processing,
[02:19] be extremely good at just task management
[02:21] and then grouping things.
[02:22] And then the next day, creating your calendar
[02:25] aligned to the goals that you've set for yourself
[02:27] the day before in terms of the tactical
[02:29] where you group those tactical tasks together.
[02:31] And then the more strategic deep thinking
[02:33] walking out that additional space.
[02:35] I feel like you and I are very aligned
[02:37] on a lot of things.
[02:37] This is exactly how I approach parties.
[02:40] Have you read Getting Things Done by David Allen?
[02:42] I don't read a lot of nonfiction actually.
[02:45] Okay, what you're describing is very aligned
[02:48] with this approach to processing and taking to dos.
[02:51] And it's kind of what I built my approach on.
[02:53] And so you naturally emerged out of your head.
[02:57] I love it.
[02:58] Let's move on to talking a little bit
[03:01] about your team and hiring and things like that.
[03:03] And there's just gonna be kind of a grab-back
[03:04] set of questions.
[03:06] What does your current PM team look like?
[03:08] Either number-wise or just ratio?
