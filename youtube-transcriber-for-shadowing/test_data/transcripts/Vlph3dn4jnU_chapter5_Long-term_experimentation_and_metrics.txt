============================================================

[00:00] accessible outliers.
[00:01] So this begs the question, that sounds like a very long feedback loop, and I don't know
[00:05] what I do with that information if five years from now, oh, okay, that was a really good
[00:08] idea we did five years ago.
[00:10] Correct.
[00:11] Comment on that because it touches on something you said about how metrics aren't actually
[00:14] a driver of how you all think at Shopify.
[00:16] So take that wherever you want to go.
[00:18] Yeah.
[00:19] So it's interesting on, I think at Shopify, we kind of very purposely set up different
[00:24] parts of the org to think on very different time horizons and with very different ways
[00:29] of thinking about how to build product and the like, very different than a lot of companies
[00:34] that typically have maybe one kind of unified, there's one North Star that the entire company
[00:39] is rallying around.
[00:41] And so there's three major product groups at Shopify.
[00:45] There's core product, which is basically building the hundred year, the right things
[00:50] for commerce a hundred years from now.
[00:52] There's merchant services, which is building things like payments, shipping, kind of
[00:57] the tools that entrepreneurs need to be successful with a more kind of shorter or medium term horizon.
[01:04] And then growth is really thinking about kind of that end to end customer journey.
[01:07] How can we bring folks on and make sure that it's successful?
[01:11] And then from a metric standpoint, we do have some obviously some leading indicators
[01:15] and growth that we're looking at on a given experiment or what have you.
[01:19] But the key and what we try to instrument in our experimentation is the ability
[01:25] to really look at long-term effects of experiments.
[01:29] So we've constantly will relook at an experiment a year later, see that the way the GMV curve
[01:37] for the distribution was different than we might have originally thought.
[01:41] Now actually change what we do with from that previous experiment.
[01:46] And so there's a lot of long-term monitoring of experiments over these very long time
[01:51] horizons to both inform what those input metrics are.
[01:55] More importantly, hold ourselves accountable to do we actually move what we cared about,
[02:01] which is that long-term GMV in the right way.
[02:04] Wow. Okay. I want to spend more time here.
[02:06] So the way you're describing it is the way the business operates is you think,
[02:12] what is our hundred-year plan?
[02:13] How do we think? Where does this need to be in a hundred years?
[02:17] And with that, it allows you to run these long, hold out experiments to see
[02:24] is something we're doing impacting the business broadly.
[02:27] And because you think so long-term, you can take a year or two or three to see
[02:32] if there's an impact and then make adjustments versus having to drive
[02:36] a certain metric every quarter of a year.
[02:38] Correct. And on growth, we're definitely in the, we want to drive metrics
[02:42] on a short-term basis so we can do that, obviously.
[02:45] But we have the luxury and just the way kind of Toby kind of thinks about the world
[02:51] and the way we operate to really think about these long-term effects
[02:53] and make sure that we're holding ourselves accountable with these long-term holdouts
[02:57] and then constantly refining the input metrics that we're using
[03:01] and getting a lot smarter about that.
[03:03] But because we take that long horizon, it allows us to be better in the short term
[03:07] and just get a lot smarter and a lot of counterintuitive things.
[03:11] And I would encourage everyone, if you can, look at some of the experiments
[03:14] that you thought were your biggest winners.
[03:17] Look at the downstream metrics for a year or two years on that experiment.
[03:21] And I'll bet you'd be surprised how many times the metric is different
[03:25] than what you thought it would be after a year.
[03:28] Because where people just make a call at a certain point in time,
[03:31] here's the last image.
[03:32] Here's the last.
[03:32] Your experience. I love this.
[03:34] Because very few people have experiences running a long-term experiment.
[03:38] And so this is a really interesting insight that you're sharing that,
[03:43] I guess, how often do you find this to be true in your long-term holdouts
[03:47] where things end up being very different downstream?
[03:51] I think there's probably two things that have been very common.
[03:55] And I would say in quite a few cases, you get a lift on a metric upfront,
[04:01] a more short-term metric,
[04:02] number of people who become a paying shop
[04:04] or number of people who make their first shale and Shopify's.
[04:07] And then you look a year later,
[04:09] and there's actually no incremental lift on GMV from that cohort.
[04:13] And so I think it actually trains a lot of us in growth
[04:15] or looking at these short-term metrics.
[04:17] A lot of the time, it's actually more pull-forward effect
[04:20] than you fully, fully realize or an incremental user
[04:24] that's just really not worth that much.
[04:26] So that's one.
[04:27] And then two, so it's just effect size goes away.
[04:33] There are cases where the experiment has flipped the other way.
[04:36] And then there are cases, and these are the most interesting ones,
[04:39] where you realize that you uncovered a pocket of merchants
[04:45] that are actually extremely valuable entrepreneurs
[04:49] who go on to be successful,
[04:51] that you missed in your kind of normal short-term measurement techniques.
[04:58] And so kind of all across the board, we see that,
[05:00] but actually the most common is it actually isn't a long-term lift
[05:04] from a lot of things that you might think of the short-term are.
[05:08] Is there an example in that second bucket of what you mean
[05:10] when you say there's like a pocket of valuable merchants?
[05:14] Yeah, I think a lot of this has to do with what we call monetary friction, right?
[05:20] So one of the hardest things to do with the business
[05:23] is when you're getting started is you might not have any revenue coming in, right?
[05:27] And you're kind of bootstrapping,
[05:29] which in a Shopify's case might be 39 bucks a month,
[05:32] but it's still, it's a real expense.
[05:35] And so typically when you can lower the barriers to monetary friction
[05:39] in some form that could be all sorts of monetary friction early,
[05:44] the common belief is that we'll usually get lower quality folks coming in the door
[05:51] because usually discounts are associated with lower quality.
[05:55] If you think about in a business case,
[05:58] if I give you a little less, little monetary boost
[06:02] and reduce that monetary friction,
[06:04] I can actually causally change your ability to become successful
[06:08] because I've given you a little bit more time to try that idea a little bit longer.
[06:11] I've given you that opportunity to move your business over to Shopify.
[06:15] And so often in those types of experiments,
[06:17] you see that you've basically unlocked a class of people
[06:21] who might have given up without that monetary,
[06:26] reducing that monetary friction.
[06:27] Interesting. And giving them time to actually make it work.
[06:31] To make it work.
[06:32] So just roughly, do you have a sense of how often you find no effect
[06:37] after a year that you saw early impact just to ballpark?
[06:41] Yeah, it's fine. It's in the 30 to 40 percent range.
[06:44] Okay. Like I think you're tearing the heart out of so many growth people right now
[06:47] and nobody wants to hear this that works on growth,
[06:50] where you're saying potentially a third of the experiments they're running today
[06:55] that are showing lift probably don't have that same,
[06:59] don't have any impact down the road.
[07:01] Yes. Unfortunately, I think that's brutal.
[07:04] Probably more common than we like to believe.
[07:06] Yes. And that's going to, nobody wants to hear this,
[07:10] except people that, you know, you should want to hear this
[07:13] because if you want to build a business that grows and continues to grow,
[07:17] it's better to learn that now.
[07:20] Yeah. Okay.
[07:23] So for people that can't run a whole long holdout experiments,
[07:26] I guess is there anything that you find is a good early indicator
[07:29] that that might be the case because most people don't have time
[07:31] to sit around and wait a year or two or three.
[07:33] They're not thinking 100 years.
[07:35] I mean, I think end of the day, that is going to be the most effective
[07:38] and you actually learn the most.
[07:40] I think it is, though, even in shorter term horizons,
[07:47] really being as specific as you can be about what are the early signs
[07:52] of success in your product and making sure you instrument those
[07:56] and then making sure particularly kind of up funnel experiments,
[08:00] you are actually looking at those, the further downstream metrics
[08:05] to make sure you have some understanding of what's moving down.
[08:09] So as deep as you can go in the funnel for as long as you can wait, do that.
[08:13] And if you can't, you know what, I would say still you should just bet on
[08:17] if something is showing lift up funnel, still ship it.
[08:20] And it's probably not going to hurt you,
[08:22] but don't overestimate the amount of impact that this is having.
[08:26] So it's funny, like two things here is like, don't like my recommendation,
[08:30] folks, is don't think, oh, my goodness, I have to wait all this time.
[08:34] Is that because you're if you didn't move the upper the short term impact,
[08:37] you're not going to have the long term lift.
[08:39] So still ship if it's short term lift.
[08:42] Just be reasonable that if you can do measure it longer term,
[08:45] you'll get better at identifying what things are that are really impactful.
[08:49] Got it. And so you're so it may be positive initially,
[08:53] but often neutral rarely is it neutral initially and then positive down the road.
[08:59] We've seen we've seen there are some there are some cases of that,
[09:03] but it's rarely I've seen neutral be positive, but I haven't seen negative.
[09:07] Got it. OK, so the old resultive positive. Got it.
[09:10] OK, that's so that's reassuring.
[09:11] It's not you're not harming the business.
[09:13] You're not in the business.
[09:14] But you're probably getting a lot more credit than you deserve
[09:16] as a growth team shipping things that are likely likely. Yes, likely.
[09:21] And there's there's also just like tradeoffs to like moving on,
[09:24] you know, and on balance.
[09:26] This should you're probably doing good things
[09:28] if you continue to ship things that are showing positive rate 100 percent.
[09:32] OK, this is awesome. OK.
[09:35] For people that want to run long term, hold that experiments.
[09:39] I imagine you've built your own experimentation system internally.
[09:42] Yeah, we have. Yeah.
[09:43] And is it basically you hold out 10 percent,
[09:45] say it was some percentage of users from seeing the new change?
[09:48] Is that how you approach it?
[09:49] Is there a different way to approach it?
[09:51] Two things. We have two layers of hold out.
[09:53] So one is the more the holdouts of like every change in a quarter
[09:57] hold out 5 percent across the board.
[10:00] Second is for changes that only affect new merchants.
[10:04] What we'll do is we'll take that group of folks
[10:07] that's called 50 50 split and then run that for, you know, a few weeks.
[10:13] And then what we're doing with the long term effects
[10:15] is we'll actually ship the winner to 100 percent.
[10:18] But we're looking at the the cohort of folks who was assigned to the experiment.
[10:24] We're going back and looking at those people who were assigned a year later.
[10:28] So it allows us to still ship, get stuff out.
[10:31] But we've kind of held the experiment in a way
[10:34] that allows us to see those those long term effects
[10:38] just for the cohort that was exposed.
[10:39] That only works if you're doing it on new users for existing.
[10:43] It's a little more complicated.
[10:46] That's OK.
[10:46] And then in our experimentation tools,
[10:48] all experimenters are paying that three months, six months, nine months,
[10:51] 12 months with here, the updated results.
[10:54] So you can't really get hide from.
[10:59] What are this really result in over a longer term horizon?
[11:02] So your tool emails everyone that's involved in the experiment
[11:05] of like, here's what this cohort is doing now.
[11:08] Correct. I love that. OK, that's awesome.
[11:10] It's interesting to use kind of these cohort curves for GMV.
[11:14] And is that the core metric you look at to see?
[11:17] There's a few GMV, obviously gross profit,
[11:21] but GMV is kind of like the key, key determinant of long term success.
[11:27] So it's interesting.
[11:28] Most people use cohort retention curves.
[11:30] You're using cohort because you don't look at retention.
[11:33] You're looking at for GMV over time.
[11:35] So that's really interesting.
[11:36] GMV over time, which correlates better.
[11:38] And there's a retention in profit.
[11:40] And then really like the absolute number of merchants
[11:44] who are on the platform and then reaching certain GMV.
[11:48] Got it. OK.
[11:49] I'm going to I'm going to not keep falling as bad
[11:51] because there's we can go.
