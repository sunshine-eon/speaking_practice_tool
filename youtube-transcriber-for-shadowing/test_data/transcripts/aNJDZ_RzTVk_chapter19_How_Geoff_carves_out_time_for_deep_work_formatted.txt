And think ahead, because they're not required to build code all day in design. This is the advantage you have as a PM. I always think that PMs often don't really have any special unique skills. They just have the time to do the things that nobody else wants to do or can't, or doesn't have the time to do or doesn't want to do. 

And just this really important point of just spending the time to think and not just constantly try to discuss things in meetings or, like you said, just Google around for answers that ends up being incredibly important. I just love this framework of just starting a doc with a little question at the top and just sit there and try to answer the question on your own before doing anything. I think that's a really good approach. 

I want to ask how you actually do that. How do you actually create these blocks of time? There's this concept of deep work and how valuable it is to creative work and knowledge work. How do you do that for yourself? How do you block out time and not get bugged all day? 

Because we're like really anti-meeting at Ramp, I had time in my calendar. And so what I would basically do is, the Friday before I kind of clocked out, I would look at the next week, I would look at the top questions that I needed to spend time thinking about and then I would block out that time. I also work on one day of the weekend in terms of deep work. I find that hanging out outside and doodling on my piece of paper, some thoughts is actually really refreshing because it doesn't feel like work. It feels like just me philosophizing about something. 

And so yeah, blocking out that time, finding a space where things are less busy, where you're not in the critical path either early mornings or later afternoons or a day on the weekend is the best path for it. 

What do you do if someone wants to actually schedule a meeting with you or reach out or put something on your calendar? Is there a kind of policy there to protect that time? I think that I should never really be in the critical path of anything. So largely I'm not available, but if they really need to get to me, they have my phone number. 

Cool. The thing that I found really valuable is just on Wednesday mornings and Friday mornings, I just have this huge block called Deep Work Time. If you book a time during this time, I will slap you. And I don't know if I'll.
