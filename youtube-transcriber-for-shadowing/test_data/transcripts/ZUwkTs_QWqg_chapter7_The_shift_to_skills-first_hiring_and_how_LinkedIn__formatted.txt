============================================================

Of the product and hopefully somehow how we might operate it. So I think with your vantage point at being at the center of hiring, a lot is changing within the hiring marketplace in the past, I don't know, year at this point. It used to be very candidate-oriented, where they had all the power and the salaries were crazy, with everyone bidding and trying to get people to join their company. Now, it's completely opposite. There are so many people looking, and companies have all the power. I'm curious what you've seen if that's roughly it or what you're seeing basically in the hiring market these days.

Well, first of all, the balance that you're talking about is shifting in the sense that there are more seekers in the marketplace now and fewer open jobs. Of course, that changes how many applications you get for the job and how you have to look through them. I think there's a model where people think it's shifting dramatically back to exactly the way it was. However, I actually think some of the changes that occurred during the last couple of years are sticking around. Let me give you a couple of examples of where I think things are really changing.

The first thing that happened, and maybe in my opinion, one of the big changes to the world that no one's really talking about, is the impact of skills-based hiring. For the longest time, and I'll give you a concrete example, it was March 2020, and we were just watching COVID hit. It was a heartbreaking moment where in the feed, you were seeing all these people, by no fault of their own, starting to post that they had lost their jobs. We started seeing in our data that some areas, like hospitality, were really getting hit, but some areas, like customer service, just couldn't hire enough. You would think the marketplace would balance pretty quickly, but it wasn't happening. A large reason behind this was that people were used to looking for certain titles and didn’t realize how others could do these jobs.

So, we made a pretty big push in something we call skills-first hiring. This was the idea that we could translate people's experiences into a set of skills. By doing that, we could help them really start balancing the marketplace with a much different system. Instead of saying, “I need to have this talent,” you could say, “I need someone who can do negotiation, and I need someone who can help me understand how to de-escalate a customer situation.” We found that a lot of people in hospitality have about 70% of the skills needed in customer service, and of course, you could train up the rest. We started seeing skills-first hiring really take off, and at this point, roughly 47% of our recruiters explicitly use skills when looking for candidates. That’s a pretty big change that we’re actually seeing.

Another significant trend is that more people are starting to look for jobs based on values. They’re saying, “Look, job sites work; you come in and look for a job and a title, and that’s how you navigate the world.” We started realizing that a lot of people wanted to come in and instead of looking at it that way, they might say, “I really want a job that aligns with my purpose or even my interests.” For example, I may want something in AI. We started launching collections and ways to filter these things. We’re still seeing some of that being used.

I think the job market is rebalancing, but it’s being done in a very different way that seems to be a change that holds through these ups and downs. It will be interesting to see how it evolves. What’s fascinating is that this change isn’t happening on its own. As you know, you’re the biggest job marketplace in the world, right? You have a lot of professional jobs on your platform and many professional seekers. I imagine it is, I don’t know, I guess Indeed might be a competitor, but let’s say it’s one of the bigger job markets. You influence the way jobs are sought and posted, right? 

In a sense, it sounds like there was an internal decision to focus on a skills approach. What’s cool about that is it changes the way hiring happens in the world. It’s one of the things I find so interesting about building products today: it has to clearly be something people want. If we had just said, “We’re going to go like this,” and every hire was like, “I don’t want to do this,” or every job seeker said, “This doesn’t matter to me,” I don’t think anything would click. We also have to be receptive enough to amplify that signal and allow it to work through a system so that it could actually be easy to use.

I don’t know if it was a conscious decision to say, “Hey, we’ve got to go and do this value of this thing.” I think we started feeling it and hearing it from members, and as we adapted, these things started amplifying as they came through. I do think that’s something I think about a lot: let’s just make sure that we keep a pulse on what people want. We need to ensure that we can get that through a system at a pretty fast pace because then we will hopefully continue to be a place where people want to go look for jobs and make hires.
