============================================================

I appreciate it. Congrats to you too, Brian. Things seem to be going great. I'm excited that you're here. I want to start with the elephant in the room for a lot of listeners of this podcast. What is going on with product management at Airbnb? You made some comments at FigmaConfig. A lot of people got this impression that you eliminated product management at Airbnb. I've heard from a lot of product execs having boardroom conversations as a result of that. They were trying to decide, should we remove product management from the company? Should we significantly cut product management? I'm just curious to hear from you. What is the latest on your thinking on product management and what's happening with product management at Airbnb?

I spoke at Figma four or five months ago. I spoke to a room of designers. I then got off stage and saw someone tweet that said something to the nature of that I said I got rid of the product management function, and all the designers started cheering. I want to talk about two things: what I actually meant because I didn't actually get rid of the people, and also why did the people in the room cheer? That's also a thing we should ask ourselves. I hope everyone listening to this podcast understands where that place came from. The 5,000 designers in the room cheered because they thought I eliminated the existence of a function. If I said I eliminated the engineering function, no one would have cheered. It was specifically that function. I want to talk about what that might mean.

It wasn't the people; it's the way they're working together. We no longer have the traditional product management function as it existed even a few years ago. We didn't get rid of people helping drive the product. What we did is we combined what one might call the inbound product development responsibilities of product managers with the outbound or marketing responsibilities of product marketing. That's the first thing we did. The second thing we did is we off-boarded much of the program management functions that product managers may do to actual program managers. A lot of people with the product management title are actually program managers. We actually started off-boarding some responsibilities to program managers.

The last thing we did is we made the group smaller and more senior. We don't really have a lot of junior product marketers. The most senior people are called product marketers, but everyone has to understand how to talk about the product. The basic idea is this: you can't build a product unless you know how to talk about the product. You can't be an expert in making the product unless you're also an expert in the market for it. A lot of companies, what they do is they ship a product, and it doesn't work. They say, "We tried that. It didn't work." If you say you tried it and it didn't work, my question is: was it a bad product, a bad strategy, or bad execution? Maybe it was a really well-made product, but you had no distribution plan. You had no way to talk about the product. If you build a great product and no one knows about it, did you even build a product?

That is essentially what we do. We have a much smaller function. The people are much more senior, and they have much more responsibility. The other thing, though, is that they do not control or drive design or engineering. We are a fairly purely functional model. They manage by influence; they do not have control. Now, you might ask, how does that work in a company where people can only manage by influence? Here's the amazing thing: we built and designed a company where you can manage by influence, and no one has to like you. You don't actually have to win people over.

The last thing I want to say is, why did 5,000 designers cheer when people thought I removed the product management function? I don't know if I can speak on behalf of all the designers, but having talked to a lot of designers, I think designers in the Valley are very, very frustrated with the product development process. Not to say the product managers, but they're extremely frustrated. I think a lot of designers feel like they're compromising. Many designers I know, heads of design, well-known heads of design, I told them they're not designers; they're design administrators. They're running a design service organization.
