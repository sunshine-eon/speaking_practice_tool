============================================================

When you're trying to decide which side of the marketplace to focus on and prioritize, do you have any kind of lessons or rules of thumb? Should you focus on the customer and index towards their happiness versus the supply or the delivery person? One thing that marketplaces need to realize is that, first and foremost, you need to be operating in a stable marketplace. All sides need to be stable enough so that they're not going to go away. I think that's the starting point, and it's an important one. Once you have established that, you can then determine which kind of customer you're in the service of and which customers you will really focus on.

For example, Amazon is very clearly a customer-centric company. If they have to make a choice, they won't because they need to maintain a stable marketplace. Sellers are also very important, but they may be slightly more important than the customer. Take Taobao in Alibaba, for instance. Their aim is to create life-changing experiences for 10 million Chinese sellers. They build a marketplace from the sellers' perspective, ensuring that it can actually sell. They also have a consumer app that works alongside the seller platform. They are fundamentally in the service of sellers.

You really need to derive your approach from the company's vision. Initially, we had to clarify our values; our first value used to be "customer comes first." However, that was confusing because everyone is a customer—the restaurant is a selling customer, and so on. We clarified that the end consumer, who is actually eating the food, comes first. As a convenience company that delivers to the end consumer, we work with restaurants and delivery partners because we are all in service of the customer. Therefore, you will build your app from that perspective, considering both the restaurant side and the delivery partner side. We are all together in the service of the end customer.

I feel like you have probably 100 more frameworks and processes and acronyms we can talk about, but I know you have to go. Is there anything else you wanted to touch on or anything else you want to leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round? Just a few last words to revise: work backwards from an amazing future. The first thing is to creatively imagine a future and then work backwards from that. Essentially, think about what will make that successful and be paranoid about everything going wrong. Hence, you need to ensure that it all comes together. "Only the paranoid survive" is great advice to leave people with.

Now, we’ve reached a very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready? 

Yeah. 

What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people? One book is "Working Backwards," which we've covered. The other one that has shaped my beliefs a lot is called "How Brands Grow," by a professor named Byron Sharp. There are two parts to it, "How Brands Grow" one and two, both of which are very good. Another book that I really love, which was recently suggested by Kunal Shah, the founder of Cred, is "The Luxury Strategy." I love that book because it delves into the depth of human psychology behind hierarchies and how social hierarchies have shaped how people think about aspirational products.

What's a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed? I really enjoy reruns of "The Office." I keep going back to it and watching various episodes, especially the U.S. version, not the British one. I do watch both, but the U.S. one has a lot more seasons.

Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates when you're interviewing product managers specifically? I like to ask which products they decide speed is more important for versus which products they decide excellence is more important for. This gives me a good understanding of their frameworks and reasoning. We then delve into concrete examples where they chose one approach over the other.

What do you look for in a good answer to that question? I look for their assessment of risk and how well they've assessed the market and the competition. If their answer is something like "let's ship something and we'll find out," that gives me insight into their understanding of the product. It suggests they may not realize that the product they're discussing may not be viable or differentiated enough to be marketed effectively. It’s important to understand whether their approach aligns with the needs of the user, especially if they’re considering speed versus excellence. There are some products where there’s a clear competitive differentiation and a market gap, and I want to learn something, even if it is hard.
