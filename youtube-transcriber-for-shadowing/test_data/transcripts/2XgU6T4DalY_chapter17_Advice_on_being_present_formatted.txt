============================================================

Kind of related to this, we have a mutual friend who connected us: Allie Rao. She was a data scientist at Airbnb and is now at Uber. Allie had a question she wanted me to ask you about how good you are at being present. She’s noticed how 100% present you are, no matter who you talk to. Do you have any advice for people to get better at this? It’s so hard in the age of email, iPhones, and Slack. Her question is, when does she respond to things if not sometimes in meetings?

I actually think I'm the most present when I'm having conversations like this one. I preserve a lot of time for one-on-one conversations where I'm genuinely curious about how someone is doing, how I can help them, and what they're excited about. That’s authentic for me. While my EA might cringe at the idea of me spending time on those one-on-ones, it’s relatively easier for me to say that the human connection is part of what I enjoy about this. I think that’s true for many people regarding what we get out of work and life. 

However, I try to live that in those meetings. I’ll admit I’m probably not as good when it comes to meetings with 30 people, where I find myself multitasking. But I treat one-on-one conversations as sacred. One thing I’ve noticed that helps me invest in that is that some of my greatest friends and connections, including people like Allie, are those I met along the way professionally. I worked closely with Allie's husband, Keith Henwood, at multiple places, including Analysis Group and Lyft. This has created opportunities and points of connection. 

You get back what you give, basically. There are people in my life who are part of it because I worked with them or crossed paths with them. I like to think that if I can make a positive mark on them, it will come back and benefit me at some point too. To distill that, I truly enjoy it; it’s what I get out of work, and it’s my community. That has served me really well over time. I’ve given people advice that this is a small community, so think about what you’re investing in others, as that will matter down the line for yourself too. I try to live that myself.

That’s such good advice. Two things come to mind: one is to treat people the way you want to be treated—someone once said that, maybe. The other is to pay attention to what gives you energy and what you’re good at, and just double down on that. Make it more of a superpower.

That last part resonates with me. It’s been a big part of my personal and professional practice to reflect on how I’m feeling, what I’m excited about, and what I’m enjoying. I believe it helps me be more grounded, which might help me be more present or a better manager or leader. That might be part of the secret sauce too, but it’s part of my practice.

I can’t help but ask, is this an actual practice for you? Do you do this regularly, or is it just something you think about occasionally? 

I wish I could say I meditate and have all this structure, but it’s more that I mentioned I’m an introvert. I spend some time alone to recharge. Early mornings are especially quiet for me, and those who know me might be horrified at the time I send emails. But I try to have a daily check-in during that time: how are things going? Why am I feeling anxious? Why am I feeling excited? It’s kind of a muscle you build. 

While I don’t write in a journal or have a meditation practice, I do have a time of day I try to keep protected from other things so I can think for a moment. I think about Jeff Bezos’s approach in the morning; he calls it “puttering around.” He has no meetings until 10 or so and just wants to read newspapers and see what’s going on in email. I’m trying to do that too. I really like that—it feels good. I’m just going to putt around. 

I’ve never heard that term before; I’m going to adopt that language. It’s puttering! 

Elizabeth, is there anything else you wanted to touch on or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round? 

I’m ready for the exciting!
