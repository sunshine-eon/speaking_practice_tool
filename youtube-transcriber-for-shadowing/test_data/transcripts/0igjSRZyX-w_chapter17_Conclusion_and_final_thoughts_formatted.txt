Cool. Does there anything that we haven't covered that you wanted to cover? Is there any last piece of wisdom you want to leave listeners with before we let you go? 

I feel good. So I think we covered a lot. Thank you for asking amazing questions. This was really fun. This was incredible. 

Okay. So let me just ask you this then. Where can folks find you online? Where can they check out Superhuman, what should they know before they try it out? And then just how can listeners be useful to you? 

If you want to find me online, I'm generally on X, that is x.com slash Rahul Vora, R-A-H-U-L-V-O-H-R-A. And my DMs are open. So for your feedback to ping me, if you're going to do that, I would suggest also emailing me. That's rahul at superhuman.com. And hopefully I'll see your message soon. 

If you haven't tried Superhuman, then gosh, what are you doing? I think this is my call to you to do so because your time is worth more than whatever you think it might be. So go download Superhuman and give it a shot. Invite your team. The metrics are real. I know they sound like the kind of metrics that startups make up, but getting through your email twice as fast, responding once to two days sooner, saving four hours or more every single week. They're all real. 

Actually, speaking of which, the consulting firm I mentioned earlier, because they're so into data and into analysis, they wanted to corroborate those numbers for themselves. And so they did. They ran their own internal case study on Superhuman and they were like, yeah, you're saving our partners 3.3 hours per person per week. And there's only one other tool that we've bought that does that, which is chat GPT. So thank you. We love Superhuman. We're rolling it out. If that sounds interesting to you or your company, please do give it a shot. 

That is super cool. Reflecting back on what I imagine this conversation would look like, a lot of contrarian thinking and attention to detail. I think that's exactly what it was. Really awesome. Thank you so much for being here. 

Thank you. Bye, everyone.
