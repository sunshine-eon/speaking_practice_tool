============================================================

[00:00] Yep.
[00:01] Maggie, we've gone through everything that I was hoping to get through and more, which
[00:04] is awesome.
[00:05] Great.
[00:06] Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you want
[00:09] to share, touch on, think might be useful to leave folks with?
[00:12] I hope that people, my hope is always that people listen to stuff like this and realize
[00:17] that it's messier than you think.
[00:19] You can fail a lot and still be successful and that they should have fun.
[00:24] I think that also, that gets missed in a lot of the product content is like,
[00:28] have fun, enjoy it.
[00:29] People are weird.
[00:30] People do weird stuff and you build stuff for people, which makes it all very entertaining.
[00:34] So I've always found a lot of joy in the job.
[00:36] And to your point of carrying the water as a PM where you're kind of doing all the things,
[00:39] it's like, you can create that fun.
[00:41] You can make the team your own fun and change the culture, create the culture.
[00:46] I find that so underappreciated for a PM.
