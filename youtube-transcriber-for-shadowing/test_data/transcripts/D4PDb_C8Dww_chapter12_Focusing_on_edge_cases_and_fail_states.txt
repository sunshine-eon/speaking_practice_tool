============================================================

[00:00] With metrics, we're often looking at the average.
[00:03] And I think we talked about this a little bit earlier,
[00:04] but making sure that you're looking at the edge cases
[00:07] and your fail states is also really important.
[00:10] And so we often will set goals actually
[00:14] and create metrics around those edge cases.
[00:17] So like the disaster delivery
[00:20] is the ones that go terribly wrong, right?
[00:22] So we have this concept of never delivered,
[00:26] which is orders that are never delivered.
[00:28] We're really great at naming things at DoorDash.
[00:31] And they're very rare, right?
[00:34] And so if you were just looking at the average effect
[00:38] or the average consumer experience, it would never come up.
[00:41] If you were just measuring quality
[00:45] based on sort of average values of delivery times
[00:48] and lateness and sort of those two,
[00:50] you would, these wouldn't show up
[00:52] because they are so rare, but they're terrible.
[00:54] I mean, they're just,
[00:55] they're terrible experiences for consumers.
[00:57] They lead to churn.
[00:59] They're incredibly expensive
[01:01] because you're refunding an order or repurchasing food
[01:04] and having to send another dasher to deliver
[01:08] that repurchased food.
[01:09] So they're very expensive.
[01:11] They're costly from a consumer experience standpoint.
[01:13] And I think if you're not looking for these fail states,
[01:17] they are often missed.
[01:18] So I think when you're picking metrics,
[01:21] yes, you want to improve engagement
[01:24] and you want to improve conversion.
[01:27] And there's a lot of things
[01:28] that are kind of averages overall that you want to move.
[01:32] But it's so important to find these edge cases
[01:35] in these fail states
[01:36] and actually set concrete goals around eliminating them
[01:41] because it can be really powerful.
[01:43] So the tip here is actually make that a goal.
[01:45] Like never deliver it.
[01:46] Some team just keep cutting that down.
[01:49] Exactly.
[01:50] So we have part of our quality analytics team
[01:53] and we have product engineering and ops on it as well.
[01:57] Their goal is to eradicate never delivered.
[02:01] And in order to do that,
[02:02] you have to understand why they happen.
[02:04] Sometimes it's human error, sometimes it's fraud
[02:07] and then figure out ways that you can prevent them,
[02:11] that you can kind of fix them while it's happening
[02:15] and ultimately just get rid of them from the system.
[02:19] And you're never gonna completely get rid of them
[02:21] but you can make a meaningful impact to make them
[02:25] even more rare than a fraction of a fraction
[02:29] of a fraction of a percent.
[02:32] Yeah.
[02:33] And I feel like people may be hearing this and like,
[02:35] of course, why would you not focus
[02:36] on terrible board experiences?
[02:39] But I think in most companies,
[02:40] they look at the big numbers,
[02:42] they look at the averages as you said,
[02:43] like, oh, it's almost never happens.
[02:45] Why do we even spend any time on this?
[02:47] And your point is you should actually spend time
[02:49] on these really terrible experiences.
[02:51] Even if it's a tiny portion of your business.
[02:53] I guess maybe share why that's important is that just
[02:55] because that has trickle down effects on the brand.
[02:59] Yeah, I mean, I think it's a couple of things.
[03:01] So just because something doesn't happen frequently
[03:03] doesn't mean that it's not important.
[03:07] So the Never Delivered example is a great one
[03:10] in that this is leading directly to churn
[03:14] and it's also costing a lot of money far more
[03:18] than its frequency would suggest.
[03:21] And I think the fact of the matter is
[03:23] is when you have things that cause churn,
[03:24] you're losing all of that consumer's subsequent orders.
[03:28] And that is not necessarily observed.
[03:31] You're just seeing one bad experience.
[03:33] You're not seeing all of the lost orders
[03:36] because they're lost.
[03:37] And so I think that sometimes this is an area
[03:40] where the data doesn't show you the full picture
[03:43] and being able to quantify the impact
[03:47] on engagement, on profitability,
[03:50] will make it stand out as something that really matters
[03:53] that you would maybe miss
[03:55] if you weren't really looking for it.
[03:57] And then I think the other thing is
[03:58] with something like login errors,
[04:01] sometimes you don't see it in the data
[04:03] because people can't even get into the data.
[04:06] If you're not able to log in, right?
[04:08] You're not making any purchases, you're not ordering.
[04:11] And so you may not see it in the data
[04:14] that you're looking at.
[04:15] And so that's also something
[04:16] that I think is important for data folks to think about
[04:19] which is what data don't we have?
[04:20] What data might we be missing?
[04:22] Where might there be opportunities
[04:24] and things that we actually need to identify and fix
[04:28] that we may not see because in this case
[04:30] with login failures, they're not able to log in.
[04:34] And so we're missing out on there,
[04:36] they're not in the denominator.
[04:38] And so we're missing out on them from the dataset
[04:42] entirely.
