Wow, I feel like I've just learned so much about you and how you think just from that question and how you approach this problem on this humor piece. I'm curious if you have any lessons to share on how to be funny. One of the tricks of the trade in humor, particularly in stand-up comedy but applicable to any comedy, is something I hadn't thought of in this way. It’s very tactical, but it works and is easy to apply.

Let’s say you're looking at humor, and most of us in it, you know, we're not stand-up comedians. We're not going to tell jokes in the classic sense, right? Even stand-up comedians don’t just tell jokes; they actually have stories that happen to have punchlines. So here are two tactical pieces of advice. 

The first tip is that when you're telling a story, whatever the funny bit is, those have to literally be the last words of that particular segment. Once you deliver it, you have to stop talking. The reason for this is that the audience needs about half a second to react, and then they want permission to laugh. If you keep talking, it makes them feel awkward, and it can diminish the humor. Even if it feels weird to place those words at the end, do it anyway, because it will actually work better.

The second tip is to have a story where you can spend time setting it up, but then include multiple funny bits or punchlines. You've already invested time in establishing context, so leverage that by squeezing more humor into the end of it. Stand-up comedians do this all the time; just because a laugh is a laugh doesn’t matter if it’s still the same story. 

I feel like the entire podcast could just be this one thread, but I need to move on to other topics. One quick question: you mentioned that the ideal laughs per minute is around two to three, is that correct? 

Yes, two plus is hard for a business talk. The reason comedians can achieve that is that their primary goal is LPM. In business talks, you have another agenda beyond just being entertaining; you’re trying to promote an idea or a product. For most normal circumstances, if you can get above a 1.2 to 1.5, you're in the top decile among non-professionals.

Wow, this is incredible! So after every talk, do you run the transcript and audio through your program to see how you did? 

Yes, I do. Are you ever going to publish and release this program? That sounds really cool! I have this notion of what I call solo wear, and it’s exactly what it sounds like—software built for exactly one person. In my case, that one person is me. I’ve been doing this for about 30 years, building things that I find useful.

One of the many nice things about it is that the UI is only for one person. You don’t have to do a lot of testing because it only needs to work for me. The most important aspect is that if it stops being useful, I can just turn it off. If you have users, even just ten, and you put something out there, people would be disappointed if you took it down for any reason. 

So, the capital I go through is whether it’s useful enough for enough people to be worth the effort of making it non-solo wear or even microwear. I just made that term up! But yeah, I’m curious to see how the YouTube comments react and how many people would want this and be willing to pay for it.
