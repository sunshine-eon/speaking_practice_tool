============================================================

[00:00] This kind of advice comes up a lot actually on this podcast, especially for product managers
[00:04] that there's a lot of power in just trusting your instincts and not just being this kind
[00:10] of unbiased participant in a product team.
[00:13] Having actual like, here's what I think it works from your own experience using the
[00:16] product from your own life experience.
[00:18] But this came up with Brian's, Brian Jeske's episode, a lot of people, like he's running
[00:22] the company, he's telling everyone basically, here's where we're building.
[00:25] A lot of people said, okay, that'd be great if our CEO was also a designer, very
[00:30] product minded person.
[00:32] Many people aren't that many people don't have actual, like, enough experience to
[00:35] have built amazing instincts.
[00:37] So do you solve that by just hiring people that have a lot of experience?
[00:41] Is it like a hiring thing?
[00:43] Is it trust people that have a lot more experience, more, you know, because not
[00:48] everyone's going to have the right instinct?
[00:49] It's true.
[00:50] I mean, look, Brian's probably one of the greatest CEOs around today.
[00:55] But, uh, I can't, I like, I like small businesses.
[01:00] So he knows how to run a bigger organization.
[01:02] I wouldn't.
[01:02] So I don't know, I can't really step into that answer from that perspective.
[01:06] One of the reasons we stay small, I think it's so we can all rub off on each other.
[01:10] And, and when we hire, we can be very, very selective because we only hire a
[01:14] few people a year.
[01:16] And so when we, when I, when I only hire designers and product people,
[01:20] David hires programmers and different people in the company hire different people.
[01:23] But when I hire designers, I'm curious about their taste.
[01:27] I'm curious about what they like.
[01:28] I'm curious about what other products they think are, are good.
[01:31] I'm curious about what they've seen that they admire or who they, like, I'm
[01:36] always asking about that because that helps me get a sense of who they are
[01:40] and what lens they see the world through and, and how, what, what kind
[01:44] of influences are going to bring to bear.
[01:47] So that's the kind of stuff I'm looking for.
[01:49] And, and one of the things that we do, uh, during the interview process
[01:53] for designers specifically and product people, which is the same thing
[01:58] in my mind is, uh, they do a project for us at the end.
[02:01] So the last like five finalists will do a project for them for us.
[02:04] We'll pay them to do the project.
[02:05] They'll have a week to do it.
[02:06] They'll do it.
[02:06] And then I'll critique it with them.
[02:09] Even if I love it, I will push back in certain areas.
[02:12] And one of the things I'll often ask is like, if you another couple
[02:15] days, what would you do with this?
[02:17] And I want to see where people go with that.
[02:20] To me, that is where you can see, they don't have any time to think.
[02:24] So like, where does, where does our gut go?
[02:26] What, what are their instincts?
[02:27] Where do they, where do they arrive after having to riff on the spot
[02:33] with something?
[02:34] So what's behind what they built?
[02:36] Cause what they built should just be some of what they had in mind.
[02:40] It shouldn't be like everything.
[02:42] Not now they're like exhausted of every future idea.
[02:45] And I've seen some people who we thought were really good.
[02:47] And in that moment, they don't know where to go with it.
[02:51] Now, that's not to say some people don't need time to think and think
[02:54] it through and what, but I'm still looking for people who, who just
[02:57] their gut is filled with ideas.
[03:00] And so it doesn't always translate, but that's how I try to suss out
[03:06] whether or not someone has a good gut instinct on, on where to go.
[03:09] And it almost doesn't, doesn't necessarily even matter where they
[03:12] go with it, because this is raw, just raw gut.
[03:16] But I want to see that they have one and they're willing to lean
[03:20] into it and not be afraid of saying things that may not make any sense.
[03:24] But like, yeah, I've got some other ideas and we could try this
[03:26] and we try this and I kind of play with this idea.
[03:28] And I don't know, you know, actually now that I'm thinking
[03:30] about it, maybe we try that.
[03:31] What if we did that?
[03:31] What about this?
[03:32] And then I would say something and we'd riff and we start riffing.
[03:35] And when we start riffing, there's a synchronicity that I'm
[03:37] looking for when I feel that synchronicity and that, and that
[03:40] resonance, like the two wavelengths are just perfectly vibrating together.
[03:45] Then I know we have something.
[03:46] So that's the kind of stuff I'm looking for when I hire people.
[03:48] And I do think that that translates to people with a better gut
[03:52] field than someone who's more of a, let's call it like an academic,
[03:56] a product person, which, which can be very, very fine to other places,
[04:00] but it wouldn't really work here.
[04:02] That's really great advice for someone looking for someone
[04:04] that has a good instinct and good.
[04:05] And I think it's interesting because that's often the opposite.
[04:07] What you described is what many people don't want.
[04:09] Someone with just a ton of ideas, because a lot of companies,
[04:12] a lot of leaders are like, we got plenty of ideas.
[04:14] We just need you to help us ship stuff.
[04:16] Can I, can I, because I think that I don't want that either.
[04:19] So I don't want just ideas.
[04:20] So they have to make something that's clear.
[04:24] First of all, it has to be good and clear.
[04:26] And then they also have to be able to riff on the spot and think
[04:29] about how else they could take this thing.
[04:31] So they can't, like we've had some people who were just like,
[04:33] so scatterbrained and, and like, they've got a million ideas.
[04:37] But when we asked them to execute something for this project,
[04:39] it was a total mess.
[04:40] You could see their time management skills were off
[04:42] and they focused on the wrong things.
[04:44] That is not a go for me.
[04:46] That's a no go.
[04:47] What's a go is like, that's a clever design, well executed, thoughtful,
[04:51] clear, and here's where they could take it from here on out
[04:56] if they had a few more days.
[04:56] Or even if we had 15 minutes, what would you do with that?
[04:59] So that's the kind of stuff that I think ultimately,
[05:02] like, is the meat of it.
[05:04] Like, ah, and so I always think of it in terms of play.
[05:07] You know, this is, this is play.
[05:09] I want to play with this product.
[05:11] I want to play with this design.
[05:12] I want to play with this idea.
[05:13] It's play and you've got, you know, play is, is a thing.
[05:16] It's a very clear thing versus like a rigid, boring approach
[05:22] to product development, which can again, can be successful,
[05:25] but it wouldn't work at our company.
[05:28] Great clarification.
[05:29] I completely agree.
