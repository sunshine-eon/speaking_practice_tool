Question: What are some classic examples of high leverage tasks that PMs should try to do more often? It's important to think about what kind of tasks fall into that category. Even though you pointed out that many tasks could fit into various buckets depending on execution, there are certain tasks that PMs should prioritize.

It turns out that PMs often implicitly know what their high leverage tasks are. These are the tasks that tend to bother them the most, either because they are not doing them or because they are not executing them as well as they know they should. A classic example is when a PM acknowledges the need to work on strategy but feels too busy firefighting and dealing with execution issues. They often console themselves by saying that next month will be different and they will have time to focus on strategy. However, when the next month arrives, the same issues persist.

The reason for procrastination on these tasks is twofold. First, PMs recognize the significant impact these high leverage tasks can have, but they may feel a bit scared about tackling them. Second, these tasks require dedicated attention, and there is often a fear of not having anything interesting or valuable to contribute. This fear can lead to time becoming a convenient excuse for not addressing these important tasks.

I can relate to this experience. I have been that person who procrastinates on high leverage tasks, whether it's working on strategy, writing a PRD for a challenging feature, or aligning two teams for impactful collaboration. The difficulty often lies in the fear of engaging with others or having tough conversations. Instead of addressing these tasks head-on, I might opt for easier alternatives.

To better target high leverage tasks, I have found two tactics particularly useful. The first is the concept of placebo productivity. In the days leading up to tackling a high leverage task, I intentionally fill my schedule with neutral and overhead tasks. This approach tricks my mind into thinking that after completing these tasks, I will be ready to tackle the more significant task at hand.

The second tactic is changing my location. For me, nothing combats procrastination on high leverage tasks better than working from a different place. If I typically work from my desk, I will choose to work from a coffee shop or co-working space on the day I plan to tackle a high leverage task. This change of scenery helps shift my mindset and enhances my focus, allowing me to complete the task efficiently.

There's so much wisdom in this advice. The idea that high leverage tasks are often the ones we know we should do but avoid resonates deeply. It reminds me of a quote I often reflect on: "The cave you fear contains the treasure that you seek." This serves as a reminder that the most challenging tasks often hold the greatest opportunities. It's crucial to pay attention to our fears, as they can guide us toward what we truly need to address.
