============================================================

[00:00] So just simple idea that is clearly going to benefit you and your team.
[00:05] And so, and it's interesting that people don't, don't often do this or
[00:08] haven't even thought about doing this.
[00:10] And so just to get a little bit deeper, how would you, how do you actually
[00:14] execute this meeting?
[00:15] Who do you invite?
[00:16] What, what are the questions you ask?
[00:17] When exactly do you, do you do this, that kind of stuff?
[00:20] As I started doing pre mortems, they got more and more popular at Stripe.
[00:24] Other teams started doing them.
[00:26] And then afterwards I helped some startups kind of also do pre mortems.
[00:32] And at some point I decided I should just like write down my template for pre
[00:36] mortems.
[00:37] So I worked with the folks at Koda to create a Koda doc, which you can find
[00:42] and we can put in the show notes if possible.
[00:44] Basically that's an entire kind of template for how to run pre mortems using
[00:49] this method that I talked about, including tigers, paper tigers, elephants, all of that.
[00:54] The main thing about a pre mortem is to include people from every function that
[01:01] is going to be involved in, say, if you're doing a launch.
[01:05] And so if it's a really large launch, sometimes I will separate it into two
[01:10] groups.
[01:10] One is everything related to kind of like the engineering side of things where
[01:16] you can kind of bring in, usually the engineering team is fairly large.
[01:18] So you can bring in every engineer.
[01:20] So that's really important.
[01:21] Every engineer needs to be in the meeting.
[01:24] And so it might be a meeting of 10, 15, 20, whatever engineers and maybe a PM,
[01:29] maybe design counterpart and so on.
[01:32] That's just focused on the product engineering side of things, like what
[01:37] could go wrong.
[01:39] And then again, for a large launch, I like doing a separate pre mortem for the
[01:43] go to market side.
[01:45] And so that will involve sales team, support team, marketing team, the involved
[01:51] design team, some of the core engineering leads will also need to be at
[01:56] that meeting.
[01:57] And then over there, PR will be there.
[01:59] Over there, we'll talk about more of the go to market risks.
[02:02] So that's what I like to do for a very large launch.
[02:05] For a smaller launch, I just like to do one meeting where everybody is present.
[02:10] And like I said, start with the prompt of imagine this has failed.
[02:13] So as the pre mortem meeting leader, it's my responsibility to share the prompt.
[02:18] And then I like doing these pre mortems where we alternate between speaking and
[02:22] quiet time.
[02:23] So I'll share the prompt and then I'll say, okay, now the next five minutes or
[02:27] the next 10 minutes is quiet time where I already have that template, like the
[02:31] code of doc, where people start entering their own kind of tigers and paper
[02:35] tigers and elephants in a way that nobody else sees.
[02:39] And so people do that.
[02:41] And then we go around the room and kind of share.
[02:44] And the one other innovation I added as I did this often was I also, after
[02:50] people shared, I asked people to pick the tiger that they find more scary, but
[02:57] then somebody else mentioned, so not their own tiger, but some other tiger that
[03:03] somebody else mentioned that they found more scary.
[03:06] So that ends up being a sort of, you know, people basically are voting.
[03:10] And then as the pre mortem leader, it's my responsibility to take all of that,
[03:15] like output that the team has generated in this document and then prioritize.
[03:21] Cause again, the point is not to solve every problem.
[03:24] Right.
[03:24] The point is to identify threats that we are not talking about openly or that we
[03:29] might just be missing or we might be assuming that somebody else is going to
[03:32] deal with it only to find nobody was thinking about it.
[03:35] So then I like to create a post pre mortem action plan and then share that
[03:39] with the team and kind of keep myself as the leader accountable for actually
[03:43] making progress on it.
[03:45] Having started doing this, have you noticed a less need for post mortems?
[03:49] Basically projects failing less than having less problems.
[03:52] Like what kind of impact have you seen executing on this idea?
[03:55] Yeah, absolutely.
[03:56] I've seen us identify certain issues that just wouldn't have come up and likely,
[04:02] you know, you can't really run a simulation and see what the counter
[04:05] factor looked like in real life.
[04:07] But those likely would have resulted in a problematic situation afterwards.
[04:12] Like, you know, a great example is sometimes you'll see a company announced
[04:17] something and they have massive backlash.
[04:22] And then, you know, a reasonable observer might say, well, how did this
[04:29] company miss this?
[04:30] Right.
[04:30] Because what happens is they have the backlash.
[04:32] Then the company realizes, oh, we have this backlash.
[04:36] Then they start doing damage control.
[04:39] They sometimes might even backtrack and undo whatever they did.
[04:42] They'll say, sorry, we didn't think about these issues.
[04:45] Like give us some more time and we'll kind of come back and we'll perhaps
[04:48] relaunch the feature, but in a better way.
[04:51] Right.
[04:52] To the casual observer, like it may seem like that it should have been obvious.
[04:58] And sometimes it's not.
[04:59] But oftentimes.
[05:02] I agree.
[05:02] It should be obvious to these teams what issues these things are going to cause.
[05:08] In fact, it is obvious to team members, some team members, but the problem
[05:13] is that they perhaps haven't created that psychological safety and that
[05:18] vocabulary to be able to talk about it in an objective way and to decide with intent.
[05:23] Are we going to solve for this or not?
[05:26] So I do see a lot of those scenarios in our industry, which end up just actually
[05:30] wasting a lot of time.
[05:32] Whereas a premotem is like a very sort of inexpensive way to see these things
[05:38] because all it is is one meeting followed by some work that the leader
[05:44] needs to do to prioritize, followed by some mitigating actions, which you
[05:48] would have had to take anyway.
[05:50] So that's why I'm a huge fan of premotems is it's one of those very
[05:53] low downside, but very high upside things that I've experienced.
[05:57] I'm excited to see this template.
[05:58] I haven't seen it yet.
[05:59] I don't know that you put one together.
[06:00] So that's awesome.
[06:02] And yeah, we'll link it in the notes.
