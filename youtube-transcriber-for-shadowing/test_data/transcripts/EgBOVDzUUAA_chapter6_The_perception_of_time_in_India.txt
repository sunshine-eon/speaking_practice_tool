============================================================

[00:00] One more thing is the value of time as a concept.
[00:03] So one of the things you'll notice then is that
[00:05] no Indian has ever been paid an hourly salary in their entire life.
[00:09] But let me ask you a question.
[00:11] What was your first ever job and how were you paid?
[00:14] My first ever job, I was tutoring women on bad computers
[00:18] and passing Microsoft certification test.
[00:20] And I was paid, I'm pretty sure, hourly.
[00:22] Now, most likely you will remember what the hourly income was.
[00:26] And even though you've started making a lot more,
[00:28] you still have the concept of what the value of your one hour is.
[00:33] But if you ask most Indians and if you ever come to India
[00:37] and do this exercise when you meet them,
[00:39] ask them what's your income per day or income per hour.
[00:43] Nobody will be able to answer, no matter what their job is.
[00:46] There could be staff at the restaurant to somebody who's doing really basic work
[00:52] to anybody enough, any fancy job,
[00:54] because we've never, ever be paid an hourly salary.
[00:57] So when you are not paid an hourly salary,
[00:59] the concept of time is not the same.
[01:02] And then the concept of time is not the same.
[01:05] Paying for time is hard to do, right?
[01:08] And therefore you'll see a lot of Indians who make,
[01:11] say, I don't know, maybe $100 an hour,
[01:14] still spend an hour to send $10 on a flight ticket,
[01:18] because that's what it is.
[01:20] And if you, by the way, discuss that with many of the Indians in the West also,
[01:24] you'll realize that this is a common job
[01:26] that they will still fight for the $10
[01:29] because the value of time is something that is harder to get used to
[01:33] unless from your childhood, the unit of time was moved smaller and smaller.
[01:39] That is really interesting.
[01:41] And you're saying that comes from just the fact that people never get paid hourly.
[01:44] It's always a salary and so people don't break down.
[01:46] The concept of value in time,
[01:50] like many Indian languages do not have a word for efficiency.
[01:54] Wow.
[01:55] And that's true for many Asian languages.
[01:57] The word for efficiency does not exist.
[02:00] So then how do you evaluate it if it's not in a vocabulary?
[02:04] Fascinating.
