============================================================

With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready? I'm ready. 

First question: What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people? All right. I'll start with a guide to Midwest Conversation. So I'm based in Kansas City. I'm a proud Midwesterner. And us Midwesterners talk in a certain way. I think, you know, you hear about Minnesota nice, but we tend not to say what we mean. It is a very funny primer into what Midwesterners actually mean when they say what they say. So I highly recommend reading that. I like that they give that to people just like, "Here's what I might be telling you, which you may not read." My wife is German, and I gave it to her. I can see German being the opposite of that. Very different.

Another book—this is a good one—is Fate is the Hunters. This is a really cool book. It's a memoir of one of the early commercial airline pilots. It is wild to hear the stories about what flying was back in the day. You know, I'm a former management consultant. I flew every week for almost six years, and I never once had to worry about, "Am I going to make it to the other end of this flight alive?" That was not the case back then. Some of the stories about what it used to be like to be a pilot on some of these planes before modern aviation technology are fascinating and make you really appreciate what we have. It feels good to read a book like that being a software PM or engineer, whatever—like how different that life is. Hardware is hard. It's not haptic design.

OK, next, unless there's any other books you're going to share. 

Great! What's a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed? So I have two kids. I watch a lot of Bluey. It's really good. I swear it brings me no shortage of joy. But for an adult show that is not meant for four-year-olds, I just finished the latest season of Emily in Paris. Man, wonderful! I realize it's not the highest brow of television, but just like beautiful people in beautiful cities solving problems that are not, you know, earth-shattering. Sometimes it is nice to just tune out. Also, I'm learning French on Duolingo—a slight plug for the app. I can understand a lot of the French that is being spoken. There is no better joy than having invested as much time as I have in French and actually being able to use it. So, huge fan of Emily.

That is so funny. What a fun diagram of interests! My mother-in-law loves Emily in Paris. I saw someone tweeting about it like, "What is she on? How is she still in Paris?" Yeah, you best just not ask questions. There are a lot of questions for this show that are better left unasked.

Do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really like, other than Duolingo? Last week, I went to Home Depot and bought a new ladder. Ladder innovations you don't think of often, but you can make one of the legs go a little bit further than the other leg. As somebody like myself who has a house that is built on a slight slope, every time I go up on my ladder, I take my life in my hands. But with this ladder, I'm always even. I cleaned my gutters twice last week just because of how awesome this ladder has changed my life. So, ladder innovation—I don't think it gets talked about enough. I'm happy to give it the spotlight it deserves.

I appreciate you doing that, and it's the first ladder recommendation we've had on the podcast. 

Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you really find useful in work or life that you share with folks? This probably will not be much of a surprise based on how I've talked about our willingness to test things, but you miss 100% of the shots that you don't take. I'm a big fan of just trying things, even if your possibility of success is not 100, because you learn a lot along the way.

So, final question. Do you have any fun traditions at Duolingo amongst either the PM team or the company in general that might be delightful to share? We have way too many traditions to count. I will share the weird tradition that we do at every retention stand-up. This started during the pandemic. We obviously used to stand up in person, and then when we went remote, we did this thing where whoever's the last person to go would count down three, two, one. Then we'd all try to clap at the same time, which was kind of fun and dorky, but we fell in love with it. Four years later, we're still doing it. Recently, we've added that we all say "yee-haw" in unison afterwards. I can't tell you why, but trying to synchronize a clap via Zoom and then all shouting "yee-haw"—I did this in a phone booth the other day, and after I came out, someone told me, "You know that those aren't as soundproof as you think." But you know, when you get a good opportunity to give a "yee-haw," you kind of can't pass up on it. 

I love these little things. They sound so minor, but they're such important elements of team culture and tradition. It's so important for PMs to find ways to just have fun and do something ridiculous. I will say it took a while to get people behind shouting "yee-haw," but now that we have people doing it, you can't take it away from us. We all love it. 

Oh man, I called our all-hands for a while "y'all hands." Feel free to steal that. 

You get it, Lenny. 

Yeah, I get it. Jackson, this is incredible. I feel like people are going to listen to this with notebooks and just think, "OK, here's a bunch of ideas we should try with whatever we're working on, whether it's streaks or not." Thank you so much for being here. 

Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more about Duolingo? I know you're hiring product managers, so share more there. And finally, how can listeners be useful to you? 

Yes, you can find me on LinkedIn. That is where most of my online social media is—Jackson Shuttleworth. As for how people can be useful to me, yes, as you said, we are hiring. We're actually hiring for my team. Are you interested in thinking about streaks as much as we do? We might be the right home for you. Please, you can find our website. We're also hiring for a number of other product management roles, and they are all as thrilling as this work is. 

I'm always interested in how other companies have implemented streaks and what they've learned. So, what I'd say is if you're a company that has implemented a streak, maybe in a different way than Duolingo has, or you've found a ton of success in another vector or element to the feature that we didn't talk about today, I would love to know more. I used to catalog basically every streak I found out there, and as it's become more of a popular feature, it's just been hard to keep up on. So, if you have interesting streak insights to send my way, I would love to hear them. 

I love that collection of all the best ways of doing streaks. Jackson, I just want to say congrats to your team and you for having so much impact. This is like the dream of a lot of PMs and teams—to see this much impact and continue to ship wins. So, congrats. Nice work. 

Thank you very much. Keep your attention. 

And with that, Jackson, thanks so much for being here. 

Yeah, thank you, Lenny. This was a lot of fun.
