============================================================

[00:00] Before we get to a very exciting lighting round, is there anything else that you wanted to share,
[00:05] touch on, or leave listeners with? I think one of the most important things, though,
[00:10] to remember, and I got to it in another answer, is just like,
[00:16] humans tend to complicate things. And a lot of things are hard, but they're still simple
[00:24] until you make them complicated. And just keep that in mind, that you can make a lot of progress with
[00:30] two people. And you can do a lot of great work four weeks at a time, max. And you can figure things out
[00:38] as you go. And you don't need to know exactly where you're going. And you can be profitable business.
[00:43] And you can find customers who are willing to pay for things. Like, these are all possible
[00:47] things to do. And you don't need to be a big, huge company to be successful. And you don't
[00:51] need to be a big, huge company to make significant amounts of money. Like, you don't need to do that.
[00:54] You don't need to raise money. So it's like, all those things make things more complicated,
[00:58] actually. Some people think they might make them simpler. If I have a bunch of money,
[01:02] it's simpler. It's actually not simpler. It's harder. In a sense, the more,
[01:07] because those things come with expectations. And again, they sort of, they erase your
[01:12] scrappiness. And like, there are side effects here, those things come with very,
[01:17] very thick and strong strings attached. And you got to think about what are those strings attached to?
[01:23] And what do they prevent you from doing? You don't have a full range of motion anymore.
[01:28] So that's, I'll leave people with that, even if I sort of touch on some of those issues.
[01:32] So that's some of those ideas earlier on. And there's a really great way to summarize.
