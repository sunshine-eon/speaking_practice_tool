[00:00] and not show. So column A is the traditional, just like work from today's world. Column B is work
[00:05] from this dream reality and work backwards from how to achieve that. Exactly that. This is exactly
[00:10] the way actually Brian Chesky thought. I worked at Airbnb for a long time and it was always just
[00:13] like think about the world, the dream, and then work backwards from that. So there's a lot, clearly
[00:18] also worked out. So clearly this is an important lesson. In the example of Canva, just what is,
[00:23] what would have been column A for what Canva could have been? And what was the, how did you think
[00:27] about the column B approach of what Canva in a dream land could be? So column A would have been
[00:32] nothing, frankly, because the reality was when I was a university student with no company and no
[00:40] business or product or software experience, the reality would have been not very much.
[00:47] And so it was all column B. It was all thinking about the wild future that we wanted to create.
[00:52] I imagined what would be publishing in the future, what would communications look like in the future.
[00:57] And it seemed really impossible that it would stay on the desktop. It would stay really complicated.
[01:02] And it just seemed so apparent to me that in the future it was going to be completely different.
[01:07] Could I build that future? I had absolutely no idea. But the idea seemed completely
[01:14] likely, completely improbable, that it wouldn't be the case that in the future
[01:18] design would be online and collaborative and really simple. And so starting from that,
[01:21] we then took that concept and applied it to the school yearbook market in Australia
[01:26] with our first company, Fusion MOOCs. And then we applied it to Canva, where we want to take it
[01:30] much, much bigger. Let's talk about just how to actually go about building a
[01:34] column B company. Say a founder is listening to this and they're just like, okay, I want to do this.
[01:38] What do they do? What are the steps? Where do you start?
[01:40] I really like to start by just imagining what is the future that you actually want?
[01:45] What is the world that you want to live in? What is the future of transportation? What is the
[01:50] future of healthcare? What is the future that you want to live in an existing?
[01:55] And for example, right now I have a wall in my house in my office, which is my vision for what
[02:00] I'd like the world to look like in 2050. And so it's not necessarily that you can bring that into
[02:05] existence or you can build that into existence. But just to start to get clearer on what you
[02:10] would like that world to be like, would you like it to be more inclusive? Would you like it to,
[02:15] for me, one of the things I desperately want is everyone on this planet to have their basic human
[02:19] needs met. What are those things that you believe are so important that you would love to see exist
[02:24] in that future? And I think an exercise we often do is like, what is wild success for X or what is
[02:31] wild success for Y? And then equally, what is terrible failure for those things? And you can
[02:36] apply that just to abstract thinking in different industries. You can do that, apply that for,
[02:42] we do that for the whole company, for different areas of the company. And I think just taking that
[02:47] very long time scale of 10 years and getting a really crisp idea of what you want or what you
[02:53] don't want, that's sort of the first step. And I think a lot of people don't spend quite enough
[02:59] time imagining that. And then the next part is you don't want to have this crazy big dream
[03:04] and then do nothing about turning into reality. You kind of want to have a ladder that goes all
[03:08] the way up to the moon, which is your crazy wild vision. And then you want to have rungs that just
[03:13] like work its way up step by step. And so you want to get that really clear picture of the future
[03:18] that you would like, and then just take little step after little step after little step. And it
[03:22] doesn't matter how small that first step is, or how seemingly inconsequential, if it is working
[03:28] towards that future that you want to will into existence, then you'll keep on climbing up that
[03:32] ladder in the right direction. I think a lot of people hearing this might feel like, I do this,
[03:37] yeah, I have a vision, I kind of, I know where I'm going, I have this big idea. What do you think
[03:41] they might be missing about just what this actually means and why they're probably not
[03:44] thinking big enough, they're not making the time to think like this? I think it is easy to be discouraged
[03:51] by the two, because they're completely two complete odds, they're completely different ends of the
[03:56] spectrum. So one is dreaming about the future, not the think you can will into existence, just the
[04:01] future that you want. And then the next part is taking the tiny step that might be extremely
[04:07] microscopic. And it feels a little embarrassing to be like, I want a future that is whatever it
[04:13] might be, and then to take such a microscopic step, because I think they often have the future in one
[04:19] side or don't spend much time thinking about that, you're just thinking about the bricks before you.
[04:23] And so I think it's also naturally, we all get distracted by day to day. It's your email, your
[04:31] Slack, the things that are kind of in your face, the reality that lives around you every day that
[04:35] kind of pulls you into this moment right now. And so I think actually just making time to spend
[04:42] thinking about that is probably one of the most critical pieces, like just literally dreaming
[04:46] like what is wild success in 10 years, what is terrible failure in 10 years is a really great
[04:52] place to start is just like spending some time there. And then like even if that is so big and
[04:58] so vast and so wild, having that very first step is so important, because then you've taken that
[05:04] little tiny first step, and then the next step. And then that compounds, for us, it's been compounding
[05:08] over a decade as we continue to work towards that same mission and vision. I want to hear
[05:13] how you operationalize this. I heard from one of your team members, Melissa Tan, that there's a deck
[05:19] like this for every project you kick off, there's this big vision deck that talk about what that
[05:23] looks like, because I think that's where people are like, okay, how do I actually do this? Talk
[05:26] about that deck. So we have this concept of chaos to clarity. And every idea starts in the chaos
[05:33] side. And then you have to work all the way to the other side, which is clarity. And so chaos can
[05:37] be an idea, it can be a problem, it can be a philosophy or a belief. And I've got a joke that
[05:44] I find funny, I'm not sure if you will, but how do you go from chaos to clarity? You add clarity.
[05:52] And so the idea is that like each like little step from chaos to clarity is like the very first step
[05:58] might be literally writing it down. So rather than it being in your head, you've written it down.
[06:01] Then the next step might be starting to create a pitch deck on it. And the next step might be
[06:07] starting to refine that, turning it into some designs, turning it into a prototype.
[06:11] And then as it kind of goes from chaos to clarity, it starts to become more and more real and more
[06:16] and more people can see it. And so just like taking those little incremental steps that adds
[06:20] clarity with every single step, then starts to help will it into existence, rather than it being
[06:25] something that's completely amorphous and just stays in your head. So I think that's why, you know,
[06:30] visual communication for us is so important is because otherwise if it's just in your head,
[06:34] no one else can see it and you can't will it into existence.
