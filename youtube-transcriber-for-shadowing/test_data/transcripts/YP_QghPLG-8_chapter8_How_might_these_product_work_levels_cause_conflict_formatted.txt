============================================================

And often, like CEOs are the ones, the founders are the ones that are thinking about what is the impact to our brand. Right? And so the CEO is thinking at the impact level, you're thinking at the execution level. There is that mismatch. We litigate the minutiae of whatever issue we're discussing, but we never really recognize that it's because we are kind of default thinking at different levels. 

This realization helped me better understand why there were conflicts between two very smart and well-intentioned people or groups within a company. Time and again, I noticed that, and I was myself guilty of this as well earlier on in my career. We keep litigating the specific issue without understanding that there's actually just like a fundamental mismatch. It's not like people are stuck at one level and can never think at a different level; it's just that we tend to default to certain levels. Sometimes our preferred level requires a nudge to switch.

That observation helped explain a lot of things, including what kind of people an organization will promote. Does it promote people who default operate at the impact level? Does it promote people who more often default operate at the execution level or at the optics level? This has very wide-ranging impacts on how an organization functions.

What's an example of optics and when optics matters? When you might not be thinking about the importance of that? Just unpacking that one a little bit. Yes, so optics is about creating awareness of the impact and the execution that you're doing or your team is doing. That is the most compact definition I can come up with for optics. 

Optics is a good thing, right? I'm not saying don't think about optics whatsoever. I think it's actually important to think about optics. Now, I'm talking about just internal optics. External optics is an entirely different thing, and that's like marketing PR, which is definitely highly important. But even when we limit scope to internal optics, I’ll make the observation that you should be spending some time on internal optics because it creates energy, awareness, excitement, and opportunities for feedback. Those are all really great things that will enable greater impact and better execution for you.

The challenge with optics is that in certain organizations, that balance gets thrown off. Sometimes optics becomes the goal. Implicitly, the organization or its culture has indicated to its people that as long as you do the optics well, you are going to be fine. You’re going to be appreciated here, and you’re going to be rewarded here as long as you do the optics fine. It’s not like the organization woke up in the morning and said this is the culture we want to create; it just happens through little actions that occur every day. 

It happens through who you hire, who you fire, who you promote, and what kinds of things you appreciate at all hands as the CEO or the founder. Do you appreciate a launch? Do you appreciate results? Do you appreciate an awesome status update that somebody sent? A status update doesn’t on its own accomplish anything. I mean, they are important, but a status update is an optics activity. It is a necessary optics activity, but if you start appreciating the necessary optics activities constantly, the signal you are sending to people is, “Oh, you’ve got to focus on this optics activity.” So then that becomes the goal, and that can be really harmful.

So, there are these three levels of product work. Do you have advice for whether I should just default to one of these normally based on just like as a PM? Should I always be thinking about impact? Or is it more important to ensure alignment with your leader and your team? Yes, I think that’s the more important takeaway. 

Now we have a vocabulary that we can talk about in an objective manner without kind of pointing fingers. It’s like, “Oh, you tend to be fixated on all these execution details, and that’s not the right thing.” That’s the type of feedback sometimes that gets shared. Once you have that vocabulary, you can as a team decide what is most important given your context.

For early-stage teams, of course, they need to be thinking about the eventual impact. But I think most early-stage teams should actually optimize for execution. Assuming that they have come up with a reasonable hypothesis about what’s going to win, their main emphasis needs to be on execution because you will not see impact readily on a one-week horizon or a one-month horizon or perhaps even on a quarterly horizon. 

That’s an example of a situation where we need to be explicit. We need to get great at execution. We have a set of core insights that were informed by our desire to make an impact. But now that we are responsible for converting these insights into a product, let’s be largely operating at the execution level.

As an example, say there is a platform team that has had some issues lately with availability that has disrupted some other teams within the company and their products. Perhaps that platform team should have a conversation that, yes, we need to focus on impact to avoid this negative impact. But also, let’s pay some more attention to optics because we haven’t been communicating with teams as much—teams that rely on us. Let’s create a better communication channel with them. 

The point is not so much that this is the right level and all other levels are wrong. It’s about being sensitive to what’s right in this situation.
