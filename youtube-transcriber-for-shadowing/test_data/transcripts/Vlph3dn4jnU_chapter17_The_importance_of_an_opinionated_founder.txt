============================================================

[00:00] I want to ask your insight on this idea that people might be listening to this and feeling
[00:06] like, oh, we need to build a team that just builds great product and is not constrained
[00:11] by metrics and driving growth short-term, thinking long-term, thinking 100 years.
[00:15] This is inspiring, I think, to a lot of companies because the sounds great.
[00:20] What do you think it takes to make something like that work?
[00:24] Because in a bad case, this team just sits around and builds whatever they want
[00:28] and the rest of the company is like, God damn, this sucks.
[00:30] I have to show success in metrics and moving a metric in this team over there
[00:33] just build beautiful things.
[00:35] Is it like you need a founder like Toby that prioritizes this and values it
[00:38] and has a really good taste and intuition?
[00:41] Like, what do you think are important elements of something like that,
[00:45] of this approach working at a company based on what you've seen?
[00:49] I think it needs to have a very opinionated founder or set of people
[00:55] who are driving what it looks like.
[00:58] I think if it is, and I think Shopify, you know, a few years ago, before maybe
[01:04] sometimes drifted into the mode of we are just going to build stuff
[01:07] and each kind of team is just going to build stuff, not really accountable for it.
[01:10] And that is a very, very bad state to end up.
[01:14] So I think you either have to use, my sense is metrics as accountability,
[01:17] which is the most common kind of way to drive accountability and focus
[01:22] or extremely strong founder or set of folks who have extremely strong opinions
[01:28] on what good is and what taste is.
[01:31] If you have one of those two, you can make it work.
[01:33] But the worst case is let's just go build a bunch of cool stuff
[01:36] and kind of a haphazard way that I don't think would work.
[01:42] Yeah, this is great.
[01:43] So either you need metrics to tell you you're doing the right thing
[01:46] or really correct and good taste in your founder.
[01:54] Correct.
[01:54] Cool.
[01:55] I think that's a really good way.
[01:56] And like, I imagine every founder is going to think, oh, that's me.
[01:59] I have this. I can do this.
[02:01] I think it's rare in real life.
[02:02] Like it's rare that you're like a Tobias, Brian Jeskier or Elon.
[02:07] Yeah.
[02:07] He's just, you know, it's hard.
[02:09] Yeah, it's hard to internalize that, but I think that's the reality.
[02:13] So most people will be more successful
[02:15] in building things that are driving metrics they can track in an experiment.
[02:19] Yes. Awesome.
[02:20] This is very fascinating.
[02:22] I'm so happy we're spending so much time on this.
