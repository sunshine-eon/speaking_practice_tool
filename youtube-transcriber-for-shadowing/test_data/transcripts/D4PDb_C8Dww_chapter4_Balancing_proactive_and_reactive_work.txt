============================================================

[00:00] team. There's like so many threads I want to follow here. One that's kind of a tangent, but
[00:04] something that I think a lot of people struggle with is you talked about how you want your data
[00:08] team, your analytics team to be proactive to find opportunities to give you ideas to help
[00:14] you figure out what to build, not just answer questions. At the same time, there are many
[00:17] questions that teams need to get answered. Do you have any advice for just how to set up
[00:22] a team where they both find time to explore, dig, show opportunities and come up with big
[00:29] ideas and also, hey, we just need to figure out the funnel conversion on this thing or,
[00:33] hey, what do you think? What's happening in China right now? Thoughts there?
[00:37] Yeah, I mean, such a good question. I think it's something that never gets easier. You have to
[00:41] be very intentional to carve out time for exploratory work for deep dives because,
[00:48] as you mentioned, there are always more questions and more work to be done than
[00:52] hours in the day. I think being intentional about it and setting goals for your team around
[01:00] finding these insights through self-directed work is an important mechanism for
[01:07] holding ourselves accountable to that goal because it tends to be the first thing that goes when you
[01:13] get a lot of inbound. You're like, all right, well, this deep dive on something that I don't
[01:19] know if it's really something, the could be high ROI, could be low ROI, I don't know, so the expected
[01:25] value is lower than this known thing that I can deliver and make someone happy. I think
[01:33] to prevent that time from just slipping away, you really have to be intentional. We would do
[01:40] hackathons for our team to carve out days to just go and look into these really interesting
[01:46] things and find opportunities. I think we have the support of our business partners because so many
[01:51] great insights have come from these deep dives. It really has been some of the work that drives
[01:57] future roadmaps. They're always really great at allowing us to have this time and actually
[02:04] encourage us often to have this time for some self-directed work to go find the next
[02:09] big opportunity. If there's no answer that comes to mind, that's totally cool, but is there an
[02:16] example of one of these insights that someone on the data team came up with that led to something
[02:22] big for DoorDash that you're able to share? One interesting example was from a hackathon we
[02:28] did a couple years ago where we were looking at referral as a channel for consumer acquisition.
[02:36] When you compared that channel to others, it was below average in terms of the engagement you'd
[02:44] see from consumers who came through that channel and the payback period. We, rather than just
[02:51] lowering spend on referrals and moving right along, we really wanted to understand what was
[02:57] happening. During the hackathon, we did a deep dive into referral. We actually tried referring
[03:05] each other. We tried committing referral fraud, creating new accounts to get around rules. We
[03:11] uncovered a lot of fraudulent behavior through this deep dive. We ordered so many cupcakes to
[03:17] the office, I remember, using referral credits because you had to place an order to be able
[03:23] to get the referral bonus, so we would create the account, place the orders, and so we just
[03:27] kept ordering cupcakes. What we noticed was that referral as a channel was a bit misleading when
[03:36] you would look at the average in terms of payback and that it was really a bimodal distribution.
[03:42] You had one group of really great consumers who were referring, other really great consumers,
[03:49] and the payback on those consumers was really strong. In fact, if that's all you saw, you would
[03:56] spend a lot more on that channel. Then what was happening was you had this other group of consumers
[04:04] that were not as good, people who were posting referral codes online and getting people who
[04:11] were just in it to get free discounts and credits. We had, at that point in time,
[04:17] pretty lax fraud rules and we didn't have caps on these things, all of which came about from
[04:24] this deep dive where we found that this group of consumers was really a drag on the efficiency
[04:32] of this marketing channel. That's an example of a few things that we like to do at DoorDash,
[04:40] one being these deep dives and taking the time to really understand the problem and then
[04:46] ultimately make a bunch of recommendations for what we should do, including better fraud checks,
[04:51] caps on referrals, et cetera, et cetera, but also how the average can be incredibly misleading,
[04:58] and so looking at distributions and trying to break down what you're seeing to find
[05:06] ways that you can optimize and ways that you can gain an efficiencies.
[05:10] That's an awesome story. Great memory to come up with that one.
[05:15] So this is a really good example of a way to carve out time for the data team to think long-term,
[05:21] think, look for opportunities, find big ideas. So the hackathon is one idea, imagine many data
[05:27] people are struggling often to push back on asks that are just like, oh, we need to know, we
[05:31] just need this one thing. Here's a question, just answer this one question first.
