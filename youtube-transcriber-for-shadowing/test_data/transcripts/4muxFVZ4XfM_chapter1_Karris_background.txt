Time: 00:00 - 04:25
============================================================

[00:00] My belief is that like any domain or industry, the more it matters, the more the design matters.
[00:06] What happens is like whenever there's like a new paradigm, I don't know, it's like the mobile or
[00:10] the web or something. The first iterations of those products existing there, they don't have
[00:15] to be like super well designed necessarily because they are the first. But then like as you built
[00:20] the hundred, like thousand like different email clients, any email client now has to be like
[00:26] pretty good to be even considered like reason of like an email client. It's like that the bar is so
[00:32] high. So I think like today, it's almost like a very basic thing now. Pretty much from the very
[00:37] beginning, you need like pretty high level design to people to even like pay attention or consider
[00:42] yours seriously. Today, my guest is Kari Saranen. Kari was the founding designer, coinbase principal
[00:51] designer at Airbnb, co-founder of two previous startups, and most recently is the co-founder and
[00:56] CEO of Linear, which I am fairly confident is the fastest growing and most beloved issue tracking
[01:02] tool in the world and something that a growing number of product teams are using to build their
[01:06] own product. Kari and his team are building their company and their product in a really
[01:11] unique way with a huge focus on craft and quality, no AB tests, no metrics face goals,
[01:17] instead a focus on taste and opinions, also no durable cross-functional teams, instead teams
[01:23] assemble around a project and then disperse once it's done. Also, they have just one product
[01:27] manager as the head of product and that's it. In our conversation, Kari shares how he built
[01:32] a culture around quality and craft, how he makes trade-offs, and how he operationalizes
[01:37] quality and thoughtfulness, where design can be a differentiator in competing against incumbents.
[01:42] We talk about something called the linear method of building product, which is big on
[01:46] building opinionated software, working in consistent cycles amongst other principles.
[01:51] We also get into Linear's unique hiring approach, which involves a paid work trial where candidates
[01:56] work alongside a team for a number of days, instead of just having an interview. Also,
[02:00] a glimpse into how Linear got their first 10 customers, found product market fit,
[02:04] and scaled their growth engine. There is so much golden in this episode,
[02:08] I am very excited for you to hear it. With that, I bring you Kari Saranen after
[02:12] a short word from our sponsors. This episode is brought to you by Mercury,
[02:18] who I also happen to use for my business checking account. I've tried a lot of business banks,
[02:23] and there is nothing even close to the experience you get with Mercury. I moved cash
[02:27] over from another bank and it literally took less than half an hour to set up the account
[02:31] and wire money over at no cost. They kind of make you want to use the site more often,
[02:35] which I've never felt with another banking site. Mercury is banking engineered for the
[02:40] startup journey, a modern solution to help your company become the best version of itself.
[02:45] And Mercury isn't just a place to hold and send money. It's software built to help you scale,
