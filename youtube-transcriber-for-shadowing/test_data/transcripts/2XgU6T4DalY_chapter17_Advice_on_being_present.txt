============================================================

[00:00] Kind of related to this. So we have a mutual friend. That's how we got connected.
[00:04] Allie Rao. She was a data scientist at Airbnb. Now she's at Uber. And she had a
[00:09] question that she wanted me to ask. And it's about how good you are at being
[00:13] present. So her question is something she's noticed about. Something I've
[00:18] noticed about her is how 100% present she is no matter who she talks to. Do you
[00:23] have any advice for people to get better at this? Because it's so hard in the day
[00:26] of email and iPhones and Slack. Her question is like, when does she
[00:30] respond to stuff if not sometimes in meetings? I actually think I'm the most
[00:35] present when I'm having conversations like this one. And I do preserve a lot of
[00:46] time to have one-on-one conversations where I'm genuinely curious about how
[00:52] someone's doing. How I can help them. What they're excited about. That's
[00:59] authentic. And so while my EA would probably cringe at saying I like to
[01:07] spend time doing a lot of those one-on-ones, it is relatively easier
[01:12] for me to say like the human connection is part of what I enjoy about this. I
[01:17] think that's true for a lot of people in what we get out of work and life. But I
[01:21] try to live that in those meetings. I'm probably not as good when we're talking
[01:26] about meetings of 30 people and I'm multitasking. So I will admit to doing
[01:30] that for sure. But I think the one-on-one conversations I treat as being
[01:35] pretty sacred. And one of the things I've noticed that helps me continue to
[01:40] invest in that and maybe is helpful for other people is some of my greatest
[01:51] friends and connections, including people like Allie, are people I met along
[01:56] the way professionally. So I worked very closely with Allie's husband, Keith
[02:00] Henwood at multiple places, both analysis group and at Lyft. And that means that
[02:07] it's created opportunities and it's been points of connection. And so you get
[02:12] back what you give basically. There are people in my life who are part of my
[02:17] life because I worked with them or because I crossed paths. And I like to
[02:21] think that if I can make a positive mark on them, it'll come back and be a
[02:26] benefit at some point too. So I think to distill that is that I truly enjoy it.
[02:31] It's what I get out of, especially work. And then it's my community. And that
[02:37] served me really well over time. And so I have given people advice of this is a
[02:42] small community. Think about what you're investing in other people because that
[02:46] will matter down the line for yourself too and try to live that myself.
[02:51] That's such good advice. There's kind of two things that come to mind.
[02:53] That one is treat people the way you want to be treated. Someone once said that
[02:57] maybe. And I think you come back to this a couple times, this idea of just pay
[03:02] attention to what gives you energy and that you're good at and just almost
[03:06] double down on that. Just like make that more and more of a superpower.
[03:10] Yeah, that last part resonates. It's been a big part of my personal and
[03:16] professional practice to reflect on how I'm feeling, what I'm excited about,
[03:26] what I'm enjoying. And I do think it helps me be more grounded, which maybe
[03:31] helps me be more present or helps me be a better manager or leader. That might be
[03:36] part of the secret sauce too, but it's part of my practice.
[03:40] I can't help but ask, is this like an actual practice? Do you do this on a
[03:43] regular basis or is this just something you think about like I should reflect
[03:46] back? I wish I was so advanced to say I meditated and I create all this
[03:52] structure. It's more that I think I mentioned maybe I'm an introvert. So I
[03:59] do spend some time alone. That's how I recharge. And early mornings, especially
[04:05] people who know me sometimes are horrified at the time of day I send emails.
[04:10] But early mornings are a quiet time for me where I do try to have a daily
[04:16] check-in of just how are things going? Why am I feeling anxious? Why am I
[04:20] feeling excited? And it's kind of a muscle you build. So while I don't I
[04:24] don't write in a journal, I don't have a meditation practice. I do have a time
[04:27] of day when I try to keep it protected from other things so that I can think
[04:32] for a second.
[04:34] What I think about there is Jeff Bezos has this approach in the morning he just
[04:38] calls the putters around. He has no meetings until I think 10 or something
[04:41] just wants to putt around read the newspapers see what's going on in
[04:45] email, which I'm trying to do. I really like that. That feels really good. I'm
[04:49] just going to putt around. I have no responsibilities in the morning.
[04:51] I like I've never heard that. I'm going to adopt that language.
[04:55] It's puttering.
[04:57] It's puttering. Elizabeth, is there anything else you wanted to touch on or
[05:02] leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning rep?
[05:07] I'm ready for the exciting.
