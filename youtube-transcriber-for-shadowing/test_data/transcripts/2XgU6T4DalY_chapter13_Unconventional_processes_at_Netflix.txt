============================================================

[00:00] This is kind of what you always hear from people giving founders advice is just
[00:05] hire amazing people, get out of their way, and let them do their job, which is
[00:10] often not a successful experience. What are examples that come, either things that
[00:17] came out of this freedom, I don't know, products or features or ideas that came
[00:20] out of this, or policies or processes you don't have that everyone else might have.
[00:24] So I know there's no vacation time, there's like unlimited vacation time,
[00:27] I assume, is that still a thing? Unlimited vacation time? Okay, cool. Yeah. Alright,
[00:33] great. And then no performance reviews, we talked about that. So I guess in either
[00:38] direction, like as an example of something that came out of this freedom, or some
[00:42] process that would surprise people that you don't have a framework or system.
[00:46] We've been able to deliver, you know, speak to my own team around innovations in
[00:53] our content delivery network, or innovations in encoding, or innovations in
[00:58] discovery and personalization. We're not driven by some leader saying, I think
[01:04] this is a priority. They were driven in many cases by individual contributors who
[01:10] had great ideas for innovation. So a lot of the stuff that Netflix has succeeded
[01:14] in came from creating space for people on the team. So there's probably thousands
[01:19] of examples of product features and things like that that came out of creating
[01:23] this space. And right now, the trick is finding the sweet spot so that we can
[01:27] operate efficiently at this type of scale without snuffing out some of that,
[01:34] what was kind of the core beauty of the culture.
