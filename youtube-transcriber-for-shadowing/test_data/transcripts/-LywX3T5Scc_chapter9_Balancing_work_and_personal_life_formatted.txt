You're doing, you're actually doing. I want to come back to that. That's a whole really cool process. Do you have with closing the loop with customers? But something else I want to talk about while we're on this topic of growth is every time I saw you post something about how you had to realize you had to slow down and not just work, work, work like crazy. Talk about just that realization and why that ended up being so valuable.

In the early days, I would just work seven days a week around the clock. In our very first company, we actually had printing presses because we were printing the yearbooks in my mom's house and then delivering them to schools around Australia. And in the early days of Canva, we certainly were working all weekend, all hours of the day. It was just constant. But when you've been doing this for a while, if you just keep working at that pace, I don't think it's good for anyone's health, mental health or anything else.

So I think finding ways to continue—like I still work extraordinarily hard—but to continue to have that balance in my day-to-day where I actually go to sleep, I find time to do things like going for walks or doing yoga, journaling. I find extraordinarily helpful to make sure that I can always bring my best to everything that I'm doing.

It's easy to say that kind of stuff. It must be really hard to actually make time for those things. Is there anything that you do that allows you to actually protect that time to do these things? Because, as you said, there are a billion things that are just looking for your attention constantly.

I feel like I've developed some healthy habits over the years. I don't have emails on my phone. So when I shut my laptop, I actually tune out. And then if there's a real issue, I'll get an emergency call or page. But I think trying to delineate is really important. So when I'm working, I'm all in. And then when I'm not working, I'm all out. 

Actually giving that mental space, I think, is really important. I've spoken to a lot of founders that haven't quite found that and then do struggle with it. So when they're working every weekend, it feels like the right thing. But then sometimes you can miss the forest for the trees when you're just working harder and harder. But maybe you're actually working on the wrong thing. And so I think being able to step away a little just to be able to get perspective is crucial.
