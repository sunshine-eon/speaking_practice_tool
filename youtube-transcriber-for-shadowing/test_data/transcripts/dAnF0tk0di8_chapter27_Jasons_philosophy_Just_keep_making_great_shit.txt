============================================================

[00:00] I'm same way with the newsletter in the podcast. There's no way I can grow this thing with money really
[00:04] I've tried a bunch of little experiments and nothing really does anything. It's just it actually comes back to you
[00:09] Let me find this quote. They have of just like your business strategy in a nutshell
[00:13] Just keep making great shit. Keep your cost in check charge appropriate prices for your work share as much as you can
[00:17] I'll let the chips fall where they may
[00:21] That's that's basically it I mean one of the things I don't think I said there was like enjoy it have fun
[00:27] Enjoy the ride, you know
[00:29] Love who you're working with and create a great environment to do great work
[00:32] And so other people can do great work and thrive as well. That's all like baked into that
[00:37] It's it's not like set targets. It's not try to be a billion-dollar business. It's not aim for an exit
[00:44] It's not, you know, be on the cover of whatever. It's it's it's not many of those things
[00:49] It's it's like it's it's that maybe it's the Midwestern-ness in me, you know growing up in Chicago
[00:54] Like I don't know like it's just that like my dad
[00:58] Best business advice I've ever got I got for my dad. It's just a simple line. It's like no one ever went broke making a profit
[01:05] and
[01:07] Maybe that's just my guiding light ultimately
[01:09] It's like because you can go broke generating a lot of revenue a lot of companies do but you can't go broke generating a profit
[01:15] And I think it's just really tight. What a great quote
