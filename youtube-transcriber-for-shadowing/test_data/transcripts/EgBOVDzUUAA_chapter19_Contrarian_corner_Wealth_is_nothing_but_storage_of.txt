[00:00] Amazing. Okay. I have just a couple more questions before we get to our very exciting lightning round.
[00:06] First, let's visit contrarian corner. I'm curious what's something that you believe that very few other people would agree with you on?
[00:15] And why do you hold that belief?
[00:18] Our understanding of wealth is flawed and what wealth is.
[00:22] To me, wealth is nothing but storage of energy and therefore the reason wealth is not zero sum because energy is and we are just finding all ways to convert energy in our advantage.
[00:34] We are the only species that have managed to convert all forms of energy to our advantage.
[00:38] So, I have a strong view that we will never, never have equality of wealth. In fact, chasing that is actually a bad idea.
[01:04] But if you let people do well and chase wealth, they will have enough wealth for everybody else and it could take a lot of people out.
[01:13] And I think it's complicated because we can have all these democratic arguments and oh, the wealth is concentrated and all that stuff.
[01:20] But that's the physics of wealth. It will always be concentrated. It changes mediums, companies, countries.
[01:28] To me, wealth is nothing but an entropic complexity that will keep changing its form and shape.
[01:35] You can keep fighting it or accept physics and take the benefit of that physics.
[01:40] I think if Elon had this interesting point that wealth is just a database where everyone's wealth, I guess, is just a row in the database and here's how much everyone has and you're just transferring numbers around and that's the whole economy.
[01:54] No, but the more that is important is that you can actually increase the database size infinitely and therefore his vision of sun's energy.
[02:04] Like if you really convert all the energy to our advantage, the amount of wealth we create for humans is disproportionate.
[02:10] And all the species that have managed to collaborate and cooperate to create wealth, for example, let's define wealth as biomass.
[02:18] So let's say ants and bacteria and humans are the only few things that have the largest biomass on this planet because we forgot how to make energy work to our advantage.
[02:28] Wow. I love all the directions.
