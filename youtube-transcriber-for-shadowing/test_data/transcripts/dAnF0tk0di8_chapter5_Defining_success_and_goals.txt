============================================================

[00:00] They're awesome. They're great. So around this idea of staying small. So one is small is not
[00:03] just a stepping stone. Small is a great destination itself. Also, if you think you're too small to
[00:09] be effective, you've never been in bed with a mosquito. Now, that's not my quote. That's someone
[00:14] else's to be clear. Okay, okay. You probably quote though. Okay. And then there's one more.
[00:17] You don't need to outdo the competition. It's expensive and defensive. Underdo your
[00:21] competition. We need more simplicity and clarity. And I think a lot of these things
[00:25] point to like, there's a few paths to success and goals for people. One is build like,
[00:30] I've massively scaled everyone's using kind of product like Figma notion and build a venture
[00:34] scale hundred billion dollar company. And then there's this path, which is we're just going to
[00:38] make a bunch of profit. We're going to make individually, like we're going to take home
[00:42] a bunch of cash. We're not trying to have everyone in the world use it. I know your
[00:45] focus is the you call it the fortune 5 million versus the fortune 500. So maybe just
[00:51] whatever you want to share about just like this, what success means to you how you think
[00:54] about what success is for you for the company like you're building. For me, you know, it's really
[01:01] about what I want to do this again. If the answer is yeah, like that was enjoyable. I
[01:07] enjoyed that. That was worthwhile. I'm glad I did that. I'd like to do that again,
[01:10] then it was successful. Now, you could find you could carve out some extremes there.
[01:15] Like I'm sure someone who's addicted to drugs might go, you know, that felt great.
[01:19] I should do that again. Like, so you got to be careful with that. In a sense,
[01:23] obviously, I'm not talking about that. Addiction is a whole different story, but in general,
[01:26] with this kind of stuff, like, that was fun. Let's do that again. That worked. Let's do that
[01:30] again. Or that didn't work. I didn't like that. That was a pain in the ass. That was too
[01:34] complicated. That took too long. Let's not do that again. So it really is about,
[01:37] do you want to do that again? That's what success is to us at a sort of root level.
[01:42] Now, on the business side of things, we have to be profitable. Now, that doesn't mean that
[01:47] everything we do needs to be profitable. So I am not driven by data or I don't have different P&Ls
[01:55] for each product in a way where we're looking at them very carefully. It's like, in total,
[02:01] collectively, are we making more money than we spend? And that's the only thing we ultimately
[02:07] look at. Whether or not this product is more profitable than that product and this is
[02:12] behind that. It's all the things we do. It's all the things we do. And I don't even think
[02:17] you can actually draw lines back to everything and go, that was worth it. That wasn't worth it.
[02:21] I mean, it's like, what is the value of saying thank you to somebody? I mean, would you want
[02:25] to A-B test that and go, well, if it turned out that it was worse to say thank you to somebody,
[02:30] would you not do that? No, you would do it because it's still the right thing to do.
[02:33] So a lot of our things are like, what feels right? What seems like the decent thing to do?
[02:37] What kind of things do we enjoy making? And as long as we can, at the end of the year,
[02:44] look back and go, well, collectively, more work than didn't work, then didn't work,
[02:49] then we're okay. That's kind of how we look at it. We don't have financial goals. We don't have
[02:55] OKRs or KPIs. I don't have revenue targets. I don't have growth targets in terms of the
[03:01] number of customers we need to pick up this year versus last year. I don't look at any of
[03:05] those things. It's just like at the end, we make more than we spend, we did,
[03:09] then the things we did this year were worth it. And that's kind of how it goes.
