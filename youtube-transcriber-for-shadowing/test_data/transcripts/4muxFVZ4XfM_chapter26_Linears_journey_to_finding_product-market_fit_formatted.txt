============================================================

I want to hear about the story of how you started to feel product market fit, whatever that means to you. When did you start to feel like, oh, wow, this is actually going to work and maybe this is going to be a real business? 

Yeah, I think we’ve always been kind of, I don’t know, paranoid about product market fit. I guess maybe "paranoid" is a good way to describe it. We’re always wondering, do we really have it? And with whom do we have it? I think it’s true in our kind of business that we started feeling it very early on. When people first started using it, we could see that the whole company was using it, and they seemed happier using it. The feedback was good, and they had some additional requests for us. So we started feeling like there was definitely a product market fit with a certain kind of customer. 

These customers were more like smaller, early-stage companies where the founder was still running the product. They cared about the speed of shipping and had certain values that aligned with ours. It was a good fit with them. However, we always knew that we wanted to address the whole market and not just these early-stage customers. If a Fortune 500 company came to us then, or even today, we might not be able to provide them with a solution that works for them. So I don’t think the fit is there for that segment. 

For us, the way we think about it is whether we have that fit in specific segments and how strong that fit is. In the company’s journey, the first year was focused on getting the fit in the early-stage startup segment. Our goal was to be the default tool that startups pick. I think we were able to accomplish that by purely focusing on that segment and getting the product market fit there. 

At the same time, we started getting some larger companies. We saw that it wasn’t really great for them at that moment, but we thought, let’s work on making it better. So, in the last two years, we’ve been focusing on how to make the software work better and how to strengthen the product market fit in the larger company segments, which include companies with hundreds or thousands of employees. 

I think this is such a smart way of thinking about product market fit. A lot of people see it as binary—either you have it or you don’t. They often wonder when they will really feel product market fit. What you’re describing is more of a spectrum of increasing confidence in product market fit, and even more specifically, it’s about product market fit with segments of the market. It’s like a map of the world, and you’re slowly acquiring territory in the market with specific elements, and then over time it grows and grows.

I think a spectrum is a good way to think about it too. I feel like there’s this blog post written in the past that discusses how to know when you have product market fit. It’s probably like that for some social consumer apps—you know if it’s taking off or not, and you don’t really think about different segments; you just have users, and if you have millions of users, then you have product market fit. 

But in the B2B world, there are always different sizes of customers, different domains, and different categories. You might be doing really well in one category and not so well in another. The counterintuitive thing is that if you’re doing really well in some category, you should double down on that. I talked to Eric, the founder of Zoom, at some point in the company’s lifecycle, and he mentioned that in the early days, they would get one type of customer, like a university, and it worked really well for them. They focused on how to get more universities rather than trying to appeal to everyone, which isn’t possible.

So again, it’s about focus. If you see something working really well, you should concentrate on that until you reach a point where you feel you’ve captured that category as much as you want, and then you can expand into new areas. Essentially, look for pull and just follow that and pay attention to it. 

For us, it’s often like, for example, now we have most of the AI companies using us. Before, it was crypto companies. When we see these trends, we start to think, could we do something differently? Should we focus on getting more of these AI companies?
