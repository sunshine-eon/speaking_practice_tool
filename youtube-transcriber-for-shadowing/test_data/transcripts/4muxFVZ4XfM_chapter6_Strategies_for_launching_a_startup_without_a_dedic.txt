============================================================

[00:00] like that.
[00:01] Another question along this line, because there's a lot of PMs listening and they're
[00:03] going to be like, oh shit, these guys don't need PMs or PMs is over, product management
[00:07] it.
[00:08] And so just another question along these lines, somebody needs to do the work that a PM does
[00:14] basically, right?
[00:15] There's all these things that is on the plate of a product manager when they're
[00:17] at a company.
[00:18] And if they're not there, other people have to do those things.
[00:21] And what I'm hearing is basically, you give those responsibilities to the engineer,
[00:25] designer, and maybe other functions within team.
[00:28] Is that right?
[00:29] Yeah.
[00:30] So I mean, definitely, I think what it means is, and there is definitely like trade off.
[00:33] So like, I think sometimes when companies specialize roles a lot, it's like, because
[00:38] of its more efficient, like if the engineer just spends 100% of their time like coding
[00:42] something, then it's like they're using their skill set to the max.
[00:45] But then we just think that in order to like, build quality things or build things
[00:51] in a certain way, it's actually better if people actually also spend some time thinking
[00:55] about things and not just like executing.
[00:58] So yes, like for every project, there's a project lead that lead can be engineer or designer.
[01:04] It's not like a formal role, or it's not based on it, like, like your whatever level or or
[01:10] it's just like, you need to be certain title that you can be that it's more like an assignment
[01:16] that like, okay, now you are responsible like getting the project started and working
[01:20] with together with the team, like figuring it out.
[01:23] And then like communicating when changes or like communicating how the progress happens.
[01:29] And so it's definitely like, it means that the engineers and our designers also have to
[01:35] like do this things and like, then do you need to like communicate and then do you need
[01:39] to think about like the scope or things.
[01:42] It's a different way of doing things.
[01:44] And also not everyone wants to do that, which is fine.
[01:48] But we wouldn't in the hiring from try to hire people that are kind of interested
[01:52] in the broader scope than just like that, that they're like specific skillset that they
[01:57] have.
[01:58] Yeah, I think those last two points are really essential is one people often don't want
[02:04] to do this work.
[02:05] And they kind of are happy to offload it to a potential product manager.
[02:08] So the fact that say engineers have to do all these boring PM things like communicate
[02:12] timelines and keep peer specs aligned and make sure timelines are hidden all that
[02:17] stuff and run meetings.
[02:18] A lot of people don't want to do that.
[02:19] Because a lot of times they do.
[02:21] And I think in this case, people seem to really want to be doing that.
[02:24] The other is I think you need a really high caliber team that's very product minded.
[02:28] And the hiring bar needs to be very, very high for say engineers and designers to want
[02:32] to do all these things and be good at them.
[02:35] And so I think I think those are two necessary ingredients for this to work out.
[02:38] Yeah.
