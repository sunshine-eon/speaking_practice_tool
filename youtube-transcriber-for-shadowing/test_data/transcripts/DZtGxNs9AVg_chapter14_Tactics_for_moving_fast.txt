============================================================

[00:00] Let me ask this.
[00:02] You guys are moving super fast, scaling like crazy.
[00:05] You described a little bit about your process, weekly planning, big jam board of ideas, and
[00:10] now there's a roadmap that you're kind of thinking out in the future.
[00:12] Is there anything else that you found helps you move this fast that gives you a lot of
[00:17] leverage over the small team you have to ship quickly and move fast that you haven't
[00:22] already mentioned?
[00:23] We work from the office most of the time.
[00:26] I think it's pretty nice.
[00:27] You can say, hey, I think we're thinking wrong about this thing, or shouldn't we actually
[00:32] do this other thing?
[00:34] I think lunch together is a pretty productive hour where you're cross-pollinating.
[00:43] People are constantly thinking, subconsciously as well, about how to solve the different
[00:48] problems in which the most important ones are, and then being in office has this focus.
[00:54] Most of the time, you should be focused, but you also have this high bandwidth where
[00:58] everyone has a bit of structured communication.
[01:00] I love that.
[01:02] The answer to the CEO of a company that's one of the most advanced AI tools in the
[01:06] world is, one of your answers to how to move fast is lunch together.
[01:11] I love that.
[01:12] It's so human, and so it makes all the sense in the world, but I love that that's
[01:16] still a part of this.
[01:18] Yeah.
[01:19] Okay.
