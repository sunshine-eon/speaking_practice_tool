============================================================

Maybe it's the last question, but broadly speaking, you've gone from being an IC designer or a manager of designers to the CEO of a very fast-growing company. What's something that you've learned about leadership over the journey of Linear that maybe you didn't expect?

For some reason, it was surprising to me that being a CEO or in some of these leadership roles means you end up doing so many different things. When I was a designer, even if I was a high-level designer in some company, I was mostly focused on design, and that was my job. But as a CEO, every week or even every day, there's something different going on. Sometimes there can be problems, but a lot of the time it’s about figuring out how we’re going to handle compensation, develop a marketing plan, or organize an off-site event.

To me, the challenge has definitely been managing the variety of tasks that come my way while still trying to stay somewhat focused on the bigger picture. I haven’t necessarily fully figured it out, but I’ve learned that hiring and delegation are crucial. If you can find other leaders who can take on certain areas, it really helps. 

What I’ve found interesting is that this role exposes you to a very wide range of topics that you might not have had experience with before. You start learning about financials, legal matters, and other areas, and over time, you begin to feel like, “Oh, actually, I know something about these things.”
