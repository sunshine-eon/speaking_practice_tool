============================================================

And then another core element of the linear method is something called cycles. I know linear is all around this idea of creating cycles and working in cycles. So, what is a cycle and how does it work in linear? 

For example, the cycles are optional. Not every team has to use them, nor does the whole company have to adopt them, but they are available to turn on or off. The reason we created cycles is that any team working on software or other products often has an almost infinite list of things to do. This list gets longer every day, which can be very distracting for individuals or teams trying to decide what to prioritize. 

The cycles provide a way to say that for the next week or two, we are going to focus on these specific tasks. These are the items we believe should be our priority during this time frame, allowing the team to concentrate on those objectives. If something urgent arises, like a new task that needs immediate attention, at least there was an initial agreement on what we intended to work on. 

This way, if someone asks why we didn’t complete a different task, we can explain that we had decided to focus on something else, but circumstances changed, and we had to pivot. The concept of cycles is very similar to sprints, but we prefer to call them cycles because we are not really sprinting anywhere. 

Additionally, the cycles operate on an automated schedule. You don’t have to think about which day they start or set them up manually each time. They run automatically, which is designed to help the team focus on a few key tasks and forget about the infinite list of other items that remain in the background.
