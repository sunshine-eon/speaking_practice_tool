[00:00] I love it. Okay, so let's go back to these three. And I'm curious just what you found
[00:04] helps you become better at these things and also just like an example if you can share.
[00:09] So say with simplifying, how does one build that muscle?
[00:13] This is a tough one because some people, a broad generalization that I think comes
[00:18] up in things like when you're interviewing PMs for a job and you say things like, are
[00:22] they a simplifier or are they a complexifier? Do they make things complicated? And so
[00:27] some of it's a little bit of just who you are and how you think. But having said
[00:31] that, there's one tool that I use that I actually learned from my dad when I was
[00:36] in grade school, which is when you write something, for example, and a lot of what
[00:41] we do as PMs is written, when you write something, read it out loud. Literally
[00:46] just read the thing you wrote out loud. And half the time you'll realize it's
[00:49] way too complicated. It doesn't make sense. Or what happens is when someone
[00:53] comes to me and they say, okay, I'm working on this thing, you know,
[00:55] check it out. Can you read it? I read it. And then I put it down and I say,
[00:59] what are you trying to say? And 99% of the time they say, oh, users are really
[01:06] struggling with this problem. We found this in research and we think that the
[01:10] way to solve it is to do X. But that's not what the document says. And so my
[01:15] reaction is always and if anyone who I've worked with is listening to
[01:17] this, they're going to laugh is always just say that. You know, just say
[01:21] that thing. The thing that you said to me in conversation is the thing
[01:24] you should write. There's no reason why your prose in a document has to be a
[01:29] certain way. We're not in school. Like our goal is to get things done. So those
[01:33] are just some simple tricks that I've used to help simplify what I'm what
[01:37] I've already been working on. And as for how to boil things down and
[01:43] really find the most important thing to do, which is another part of
[01:46] simplification, I think the best thing you can do is just get as many
[01:53] reps in as you can. Have people review your work and listen to them.
[01:58] There's a thing that happens, I think with PMs where you join a company and
[02:02] then all of a sudden it's like, my boss doesn't know what they what they're
[02:06] doing and the highest paid person's opinion and the founder wants to swoop
[02:10] in and mess everything up. But those people had an insight on the market
[02:14] that you're in that made the company worth founding. And they probably
[02:17] know more than you. And so you might want to listen to them. And so find
[02:20] people who can review your work, listen to them and help ask them to
[02:23] help you simplify.
[02:25] I'll share a couple other things that came to mind as you're talking because
[02:28] this is like a very hard thing to teach and you kind of have to do it
[02:31] again and again. And honestly, I have this one manager who taught me to
[02:35] simplify it in my writing and strategy docs, one pagers and things like
[02:39] that. And I think that actually had a big impact on my newsletter success is
[02:43] learning just to strip down as much as you can and kind of anything
[02:47] that isn't necessary. So there's a couple of things that I'll share real
[02:49] quick. One is there's this book I read called on writing well, that is one
[02:53] of the most impactful books for writing for me. And the whole book is like,
[02:56] I don't know, 20 chapters and every chapter is more things you should
[02:59] cut from your writing. And they show all these examples of like, here's a
[03:03] before and here's an after and all these words were cut and nothing
[03:05] changed. They're completely unnecessary. So I think that book can help.
[03:10] And partly it's just like, what is not necessary? Like you think all
[03:13] these adjectives are important. Another thing I found really helpful is
[03:16] the rule of third, I guess the rule of three, I'm just like always having
[03:20] three, like try not to go beyond three, when you're hearing like strategy
[03:24] bets or priorities or things like that, just like try to keep things under
[03:28] three. Yeah, it's a very sort of business school ex consultant point
[03:35] of view that I do agree with and share, which is there's always three
[03:38] things or fewer, never more than three things. You have to have a nice
[03:43] round couple. And if you have a fourth, you got to figure out how
[03:45] to squish it in there because it just doesn't look right if there's
[03:47] four. Yeah, even though I've I've been guilty of more than three,
[03:50] but try hard to avoid it. You're using notion and you have your
[03:55] three bullets expanding. And there's sub bullets, but at least
[03:58] you have
