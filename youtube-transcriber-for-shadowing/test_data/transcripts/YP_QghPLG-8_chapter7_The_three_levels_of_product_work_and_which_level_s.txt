============================================================

[00:00] something.
[00:01] Speaking of fears, our third big idea is around the three levels of product work.
[00:07] Basically the three things that a PM should be focused on and how often when you're not
[00:13] aligned on what is most important to you and your team, it often leads to conflict.
[00:19] And so I'm excited for you to unpack this idea of these three levels of product work
[00:22] and I'll share what they are impact, execution and optics.
[00:26] And whenever I saw this for the first time, I always come back to these three things because
[00:30] it's so simple and so accurate.
[00:32] And so I'm excited for you to unpack all this.
[00:34] Yeah, this idea that there are three levels of product work, impact, execution and optics.
[00:41] Once you understand it, it explains a lot of what you see on product teams and organizations
[00:49] in general.
[00:50] And so I'll perhaps start with an example that most product people, product leaders
[00:57] and founders are used to seeing, which is, and something I've seen dozens of times in
[01:02] my career, is that there's a product review, say where you as a PM are presenting to the
[01:09] CEO.
[01:11] And as you're presenting, you know, what the plan is, obviously since this is a real
[01:16] world product, there's going to be some compromises that you're taking.
[01:20] So you know, the CEO perhaps asks about, okay, well, why is our customer service response
[01:27] time going to be so high in this case?
[01:32] And so and you've thought about it, right?
[01:34] Like it's not like you did not think about that issue.
[01:37] But there is a good reason why, right?
[01:39] Like you talk to the VP of customer support and they don't have the funding this quarter
[01:44] to support your product fully, which will then result in a poor customer service experience
[01:50] for this kind of new product that you're launching.
[01:53] But then you've agreed, you've used your skills of influence to agree that, okay, next quarter,
[01:57] they're going to allocate a lot more people to your product so that, you know, the customer
[02:03] service experience will get better next quarter.
[02:05] And so the CEO asks, like, why, like, why is the customer service experience going to
[02:10] be poor here?
[02:11] Or they make a remark like that.
[02:13] And then you reply with all these good reasons, like, quote again, good reasons.
[02:18] And you know, needless to say, the rest of the product review doesn't go as well.
[02:24] And you know, like after the product review, you wonder what happened, maybe you ask your
[02:28] manager like, you know, what happened.
[02:31] And particularly you're wondering, like, why couldn't the CEO see your very rational argument
[02:35] about why you can't do this at launch, right?
[02:39] Yeah, and so it's kind of like, why doesn't, like, why doesn't he or she see that?
[02:45] Right.
[02:46] And the reason is that you are thinking at different levels, right?
[02:53] Like so you as a PM, perhaps are fixated as you are dealing with this launch or this project,
[03:02] you are fixated on the execution level, which is what does it take to get something done?
[03:08] How can I do it?
[03:09] How can I hit the next milestone?
[03:11] Those are all the things we tend to think about when we are thinking at the execution
[03:16] level.
[03:17] The CEO, on the other hand, is approaching it from the impact level.
[03:23] And particularly perhaps in this case, what is the impact to the customer experience?
