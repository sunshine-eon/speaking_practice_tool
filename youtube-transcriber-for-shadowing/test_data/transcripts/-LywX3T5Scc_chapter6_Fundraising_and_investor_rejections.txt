============================================================

[00:00] Okay, speaking of investors, speaking of other hard times, there's a very famous story about
[00:05] Canva.
[00:06] Early on, you pitched over 100 investors, and over 100 investors said no to you when
[00:10] you're just starting Canva.
[00:13] I think it's more of the investors than any founder I've talked to you like actually tries
[00:17] to pitch.
[00:18] It's impressive.
[00:19] You tried that hard and went for so many pitches and finally got someone to take a bet.
[00:23] Now you're something like a $40 billion company making $3.3 billion ARR.
[00:29] I think there's something like $240 million monthly active users.
[00:33] One of the hottest private companies in the world.
[00:34] Just how does this feel?
[00:36] I don't know.
[00:37] It was really clear in my mind that it was the future and I thought the investors were
[00:40] wrong, frankly.
[00:43] But investors also gave really helpful feedback and feedback often in the form of rejection.
[00:49] So they would say, oh, your market's not big enough.
[00:51] And I would say it's going to be huge.
[00:54] And I'd add a new page in my pitch deck that said how big the market, I believe, was.
[00:58] And then they'd say you're the same as some of the company.
[01:00] And I'd say, well, coupled with rejection.
[01:03] And I would say, hey, now I've got a new slide in my pitch deck that shows all the players
[01:08] and the huge gap in the market that we believe we're going to fill.
[01:11] Or most investors knew absolutely nothing about design or the industry that we're in.
[01:16] And so we then ended up with the first few slides saying, here's the layer of the land
[01:20] today.
[01:21] Here's the problem that we're going to solve.
[01:23] And so while it was extraordinarily frustrating, their feedback made us stronger and made our
[01:29] pitch deck stronger.
[01:31] And it was sort of like, from that chaos to clarity.
[01:33] At the start, it was just like this idea.
[01:35] And then through the copious amounts of rejection, the pitch deck got stronger and more refined.
[01:41] So then when people, the first time I remember I spoke to someone for hours and they eventually
[01:46] got it, they were really committed to understanding what we were trying to do.
[01:49] But then not everyone has six hours to understand a concept.
[01:52] So being able to take all the gems of wisdom from that conversation and have that understood
[01:56] really clearly in a really short period of time and have all of the reasons that people
[02:00] were rejecting us pre-answered in that initial pitch deck was really important.
[02:06] And I think that's probably one of the reasons why when I look back at our 2012 pitch deck,
[02:11] it's so valid and really still captures what we're doing today.
[02:16] And so I think that rejection in some ways makes you stronger if you can persist through.
[02:20] Well, I think beyond that, I've never heard this part of the story.
[02:23] It's not just persisting.
[02:24] It's actually iterating and taking feedback that you're hearing to continue to evolve
[02:29] the pitch to a place where, OK, I finally get what you're doing.
[02:32] That is such a cool part of the story.
[02:33] Is there how much of the product, like how much of that vision and product change throughout
[02:36] that journey versus just the way you pitched it and convince people?
[02:40] It was pretty consistent, but the way we articulated it changed greatly.
[02:44] And so, for example, I wouldn't, in the early days, articulate the problem very much.
[02:49] And I spent into, like, here's the cool solution.
[02:51] And so then the first few pages became very much more problem-based.
[02:55] So because if people don't understand the problem, then they can't understand or care
[02:58] about your solution.
[02:59] And so there was a lot of refinement on the way it was articulated.
[03:04] But the actual vision itself, I think, was pretty...
