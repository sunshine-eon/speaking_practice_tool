Video: Building Lovable: $10M ARR in 60 days with 15 people | Anton Osika (CEO and co-founder)
Time: 00:00 - 05:12
============================================================

[00:00] Lovable is your personal AI software engineer.
[00:03] You describe an idea and then you get a fully working product.
[00:06] The reason is to enable those who have had such a hard time finding people who are good at creating software.
[00:13] That's been their absolute bottleneck.
[00:15] And let them take their ideas and their dreams into reality.
[00:19] You guys hit 4 million ARR in the first four weeks.
[00:22] You hit 10 million ARR in the first two months with just 15 people.
[00:26] You're the fastest growing startup in all of Europe.
[00:29] How did you decide on lovable is the name. It's so sweet.
[00:31] The best word for a great product is that it's lovable.
[00:34] A lot of jargon that I like to use to like emphasize what we should be striving for
[00:38] is building a minimum lovable product and then building a lovable product
[00:42] and then building an absolutely lovable product.
[00:44] So I took that jargon with me in the company name.
[00:47] People wonder just what jobs will be more important, what skills will be less important.
[00:51] Doing a bit of everything being in general is I think much more important than it used to be.
[00:56] If I'm putting together a product team today I would
[00:59] really obsess about getting as many skillsets as possible for each person I hire.
[01:03] What have you done that has allowed you to grow this fast with so few people?
[01:07] People love the product. That's the driver of the growth.
[01:15] Today my guest is Anton OCK. Anton is co-founder and CEO of lovable,
[01:21] which is essentially an AI engineer that takes an English prompt
[01:24] and codes a product for you in minutes. You can then talk to it,
[01:27] iterate on the product and then launch it to the world.
[01:30] It's one of the fastest growing products in history,
[01:33] the fastest growing startup in Europe ever.
[01:37] And as Anton describes, their goal for lovable is for it to be the last piece of software
[01:41] that anybody has to write because it'll be able to create all future products for us.
[01:46] They launched just a few months ago in the first four weeks,
[01:49] hit four million ARR in the first two months, crossed 10 million ARR,
[01:55] all with just 15 people. Absurd.
[01:57] In our conversation we covered a lot of ground,
[02:00] including a live demo of lovable, how their team operates, how they hire,
[02:03] what has most enabled their team to scale this quickly with so few people,
[02:07] pro tips for using lovable, how it all started, how he recommends you build
[02:11] product teams going forward with tools like this existing,
[02:14] what skills will matter more and less going forward,
[02:17] plus how to think about lovable versus competitors and so much more.
[02:21] If you're trying to wrap your head around how product building will change
[02:24] with the rise of AI tools, this episode is a must watch.

[02:49] This episode is brought to you by Cinch, the customer communications cloud.
[02:54] Here's the thing about digital customer communications.
[02:57] Whether you're sending marketing campaigns, verification codes,
[03:00] or account alerts, you need them to reach users reliably.
[03:03] That's where Cinch comes in.
[03:05] Over 150,000 businesses, including eight of the top 10 largest tech companies globally,
[03:11] use Cinch's API to build messaging, email, and calling into their products.
[03:15] And there's something big happening in messaging that product teams need to know about.
[03:19] Rich Communication Services, or RCS.
[03:23] Think of RCS as SMS 2.0.
[03:25] Instead of getting text from a random number,
[03:27] your users will see your verified company name and logo
[03:30] without needing to download anything new.
[03:32] It's a more secure and branded experience.
[03:35] Plus you get features like interactive carousels and suggested replies.
[03:39] And here's why this matters.
[03:40] US carriers are starting to adopt RCS.
[03:44] Cinch is already helping major brands send RCS messages around the world.
[03:48] And they're helping Lenny's podcast listeners get registered first
[03:51] before the rush hits the US market.

[04:28] securely verify individuals and businesses across the world.
