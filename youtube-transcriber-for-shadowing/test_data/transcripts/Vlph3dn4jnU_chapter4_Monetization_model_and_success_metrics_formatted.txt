Be successful. One of the main reasons companies focus so much on churn and retention is because it costs them a lot of money to drive new customers and users. I imagine there's an almost implied notion that it's really cheap for you all to find new customers because of maybe the brand and word of mouth. Is that true?

I think that definitely has some dynamics. The bigger factor, however, is the monetization model. For most SaaS companies, they're making money from subscriptions, right? They're paying 29 bucks a month, and that's the only way they can really monetize. In contrast, our business model allows us to grow with the merchant. We have folks who are paying a subscription, but as they get bigger, we monetize on the GMV that the merchant is producing. The revenue generated from payments and other services allows us to thrive alongside those successful merchants, making the whole system work well.

Got it. So basically, your net dollar retention or net revenue retention is just absurd for the winners, and it compensates for all the losers—people who have tried to build it online but haven't succeeded. When you think of the parallel with angel investing, most angel investments don't work out, but the few that do make the entire portfolio successful.

With retention not being the primary goal and the metric you focus on optimizing, how do you know if you're doing well? Is it based on a certain number of these winners emerging every quarter or year? How do you think about progress and achieving success for growth?

We look at a cohort of users we acquire in a given time period, say a quarter. Then, over the next year, two years, three years, four years, or five years, we assess how much GMV those merchants have produced in total—not on a per merchant basis, but in total. If that cohort generates GMV, it will translate into revenue and gross profit, which we can then reinvest in growing the business. So, it's really about looking at the total value based on GMV, which is a power law-based metric. That power law drives the success of each cohort.

Again, going back to investing, it's the same concept. Each vintage from a fund is assessed based on how much it returns. Ultimately, the success of the fund is driven by the few standout investments.
