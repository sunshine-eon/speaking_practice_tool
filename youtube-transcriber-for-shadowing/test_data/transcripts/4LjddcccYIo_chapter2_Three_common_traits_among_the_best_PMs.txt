============================================================

[00:00] Maggie, thank you so much for being here.
[00:02] Welcome to the podcast.
[00:04] Thanks for having me.
[00:05] I'm super excited.
[00:06] You put out so much content across podcasts, blogs, tweets.
[00:11] I'm sure there's other things I haven't even seen.
[00:13] And so what I've done is I've scoured all of your content
[00:16] as much as I could to find topics
[00:18] that we could dig into in our conversation today.
[00:22] And I thought it'd be fun to start with
[00:24] how to become a successful product manager
[00:26] and what it takes to be a successful product manager,
[00:29] especially long-term in your career.
[00:31] You've worked through a bunch of PMs.
[00:33] You've hired a lot of PMs.
[00:34] You've managed a lot of PMs.
[00:36] And so I guess the question is just,
[00:37] what are some common threads you've seen
[00:40] across the best product managers?
[00:44] Yeah, it's an interesting question,
[00:46] mostly because I've worked in startups,
[00:50] zero to one, scaling stage startups, enterprise,
[00:53] all that kind of stuff.
[00:54] And there's a lot of content out there,
[00:56] I think on how those roles are different
[00:58] and how PMs are different
[00:59] across those different types of companies.
[01:01] But what I've seen is that there are some standard things
[01:05] that are the same across the role
[01:06] no matter whether you're a consumer or B2B
[01:08] or startup or a large company.
[01:10] And in particular about what sets PMs apart
[01:13] from one another.
[01:14] And the things that I look for when I'm hiring
[01:17] or when I'm looking for promotion to promote people
[01:20] or when PMs stand out
[01:22] even when you're not looking are three things.
[01:24] First, I think the best PMs
[01:27] are really good at breaking things down
[01:30] and simplifying things.
[01:31] So finding at any moment,
[01:33] like what is the really truly the only thing you need to do?
[01:37] Especially in a big company,
[01:39] there are eight million priorities,
[01:41] there's 700 OKRs, there's 25,000 projects you could work on
[01:46] and teams will get bogged down in that complexity.
[01:49] Similarly speaking in a startup,
[01:50] you might think that it's easy to find the one thing to do
[01:53] but at the same time,
[01:53] there's so many fires that are happening
[01:55] and so many things you could do in such a world of opportunity
[01:58] that even just picking one and sticking with it
[02:00] is really difficult.
[02:01] And so the best PMs not only can find the one thing
[02:04] to work on, but they can stay with that one thing
[02:07] long enough to actually finish it.
[02:09] I think that's a really interesting point
[02:11] because it sounds simple also just this idea of simplifying
[02:13] but I think there's so much depth there partly
[02:15] because within simplifying is prioritizing
[02:18] and that's you can almost boil down the job of the PMs.
[02:20] They're just prioritizing and telling people what is next.
[02:24] And so I think that's a really powerful point you're making.
[02:27] Prioritization is a tough word
[02:29] because there's so much wrapped up in that
[02:32] and what it means to prioritize
[02:33] and I've worked for people
[02:35] who wanted to understand the formula for prioritization
[02:39] and why this thing
[02:40] and how can you prove that this is the right thing
[02:42] to work on and not that thing
[02:44] and then a week goes by
[02:45] and then they want to reevaluate the priority
[02:48] and they want to relitigate the priority
[02:50] and so it's so much more than just a moment in time
[02:53] deciding but it's the ability to stay with it
[02:56] and to make sure that it continues to be
[02:58] the most important thing that you finish it
[03:00] and actually see that it worked
[03:03] and that you can get people to continue
[03:05] to stay excited and engage in that project
[03:07] because I think a lot of when we talk about product
[03:11] it's like, oh, what should you build?
[03:12] What should you ship?
[03:13] But then you actually have to ship that
[03:14] and that can take a week, a month,
[03:16] three months, six months, a year.
[03:18] And so as a PM your job is to stay on that
[03:22] and be the person who's beating that drum over and over again
[03:24] and the best PMs are the ones who can do that
[03:27] and have the resilience and the kind of like energy
[03:31] to stay with it.
[03:32] Energy, that's a really important part of that.
[03:34] I'm gonna ask you how you suggest people
[03:37] get better at these things.
[03:38] So either we can go into how you found it,
[03:41] you get better at simplifying
[03:43] or we go through all three and then we can come back
[03:45] ever you prefer.
[03:46] Let's just do all three really quick
[03:47] and then we can dig in.
[03:48] Sounds great.
[03:49] So yeah, first one simplifying,
[03:51] I think the second one has to do with this point
[03:53] about sticking with something
[03:54] and it's following up on results.
[03:56] So many people in the spec or the one pager or something
[04:00] will say, okay, here's the metric that I care about.
[04:02] Here's what I wanna move.
[04:03] Awesome.
[04:04] Maybe they'll even write a SQL query,
[04:06] get a dashboard going, figure out what the number is today.
[04:09] That gets you some extra points.
[04:11] But the really, really good PMs remember to follow up
[04:14] because especially when you're in management,
[04:16] couple layers up in management,
[04:18] I'm not gonna remember to follow up on that feature
[04:20] but if a PM comes back to me and says,
[04:22] hey, remember we did that thing?
[04:23] Here's what happened.
[04:25] I can't tell you how rare that is
[04:27] and how many times as a leader,
[04:29] you might have to ask for that.
[04:31] And for the people you don't have to ask that of
[04:33] is one of the best things when I'm looking at PMs.
[04:36] And it's easy.
[04:37] Like it's not hard to do that,
[04:38] especially if you've set up metric tracking
[04:41] or you know how to pull that information
[04:42] or you have somebody who can help you get that.
[04:45] It's pretty easy to do
[04:46] and it's really high value activity.
[04:49] And then the third thing,
[04:50] and I think maybe we'll talk about this later too,
[04:53] is that a phrase actually we were talking about
[04:56] David can't tell before we started,
[04:58] carrying the water.
[04:59] And this was a big theme when I joined Drift
[05:02] and this is about how you can't be a good PM
[05:05] if you're not willing to do the hard,
[05:06] boring, unglamorous work of customer support,
[05:10] sales, marketing, writing copy, project management.
[05:13] Like you have to do that stuff.
[05:15] It's your job, no one else is gonna do it
[05:17] because at the end of the day
[05:18] you're responsible for outcomes and results.
[05:20] So you're the person that has to do that
[05:22] and if you're willing to do that work
[05:24] that's what's gonna make your product successful
[05:25] which is what makes you successful.
