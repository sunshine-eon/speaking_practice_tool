============================================================

[00:00] Just to push back I imagine there are expectations of like I hope this works out. I hope people adopted
[00:05] Hope he becomes the best email client in town, right? There's like a sense of like we want this to succeed
[00:10] That's pride though like that's that's a matter of like we want to be proud of the work that we did
[00:15] We really hope people like it and we want to keep doing it
[00:19] That's me that that's a sense of of caring about the work itself. It's not so much about the
[00:25] The outcome which you don't control as much as you might think
[00:29] Clearly we want people to accept the work that we do and we want to find enough people who like it to make it sustainable
[00:35] But I don't have them in mind. I mean, this is going to sound selfish, but
[00:39] I have me in mind
[00:41] First because if I'm not mine if I'm not for me first, it's hard to be for someone else
[00:46] So I'm for us
[00:47] We want to make things that we're proud of that we think are really good
[00:50] That are unique that bring something new to the world that doesn't exist
[00:53] Otherwise, there's no point in doing it that take that that bring a different perspective
[00:58] That only we can provide because we everyone has their own
[01:01] And we want to make sure ours is very visible in the products that we make
[01:04] Which is why we approach things very differently than most and our products are very different than most
[01:09] And that's why they should they should be there where we should we should provide alternatives as I said earlier
[01:13] I don't like the word competition because it almost sounds like you could be making the same thing
[01:18] I want to probably provide an alternative
[01:20] Which is a different approach a different way forward
[01:24] It could be in pricing it could be in in in the way something works
[01:28] It could be in the flows in the thing it could be the entire
[01:32] Conception of the thing, but it should be an alternative. It's not an alternative. It doesn't need to exist. So that's
[01:38] That that's that's how I think about it. But yeah, there are expectations or I should say maybe it's more like there are
[01:44] desires and hopes
[01:46] Of acceptance to some degree because it needs to otherwise we can't stay in business
[01:49] But really it's like are we proud of it first like we're we're wrapping up the hey calendar right now
[01:54] It's the calendar. We're building for our hey email service. I'm really proud of it
[01:58] I have no idea what's going to happen. It's very unusual
[02:01] But I'm really proud of the work that we did and that's enough for me. I think it's going to do well
[02:06] I don't know though and it doesn't really make any sense to wonder if it will or not
[02:10] It just it will or it won't
[02:12] All I can do is be proud of the work that we're doing and be proud of the people who are doing it
[02:16] And I feel like we're putting something out in the world that we think should be here
[02:19] Whether or not people agree is up to them
