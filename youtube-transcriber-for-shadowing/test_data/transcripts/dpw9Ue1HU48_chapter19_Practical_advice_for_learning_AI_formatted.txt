============================================================

So it's great about watching you because you kind of build in public with this AI stuff that you're just doing it. Your approach to learning about this is building and doing. When you launched Chatbot or Chat Spot, you tweeted that it took you many, many late nights of work. For people that want to understand what's going on, get ahead of where things are going, and build the skills to be relevant in the future, do you have any advice? Is it just build stuff and do it, or is there anything else you'd recommend for people that want to understand what the hell is going on?

Yeah. So, and this is very simple practical advice. This is the same thing for engineers and software as well: don't try to go learn something because you think it's worth learning. Find an actual problem that you care about and go try to solve it with that new thing. Right? Like you have something tangible that you're trying to do. For instance, going back to my book and the talk around public speaking, it's like, OK, if I had said, "Oh, I want to learn about humor and stand-up comedy," I don't think I would have accomplished the thing. But I had a goal in mind, right? Which is like, hey, I need to be able to get up on a stage and hold the thing, and I have this measurable outcome.

So whatever line of business you're in, whatever you do as a professional, I guarantee you there are ways AI can help you, even with the tools that we have out there right now. Either use the tools or build tools on top of the APIs that exist. They're very easily accessible right now and very cheap to just kind of start. Yeah, just do it and iterate. I am also a big believer in kind of learning in public. That's why I do it. Like, that's why the culture code is out there. It's like, OK, well, if you accept the fact that culture is a product, we're going to learn about things much better.

Instead of just getting feedback from the employees at HubSpot, why don't we put it out to the world? The internet is exactly good at telling you why you're an idiot, right? It's one of its core strengths. So I would recommend having a goal in mind, writing about it. I'm a big believer in writing generally, but yeah, do it in public.

And I love that advice. Is there anything else that you wanted to share or touch on or leave listeners with before we wrap up? 

We covered a lot of territory. Yeah, we did. I might do the quit while I'm ahead thing. I'll leave it with this: my definition of success that I came up with years ago and that HubSpot actually stands by is success is making the people who believed in you look brilliant. That's it. 

What I like about that is it's not an inward-facing thing. This is the kind of customer folks—like all the employees that join your company when you're a founder, who were kind of silly enough to join you on this thing. It's about responding to customers that believed in the early product that completely sucked, and investors that believed. Do what you can to make them reflect back on it and think, "Oh boy, was I smart to have believed in Lenny and what he's doing."
