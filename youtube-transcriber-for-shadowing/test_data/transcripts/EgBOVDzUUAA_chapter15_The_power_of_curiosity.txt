============================================================

[00:00] that will emerge. Kind of along these lines, something that comes up a lot in your talks
[00:06] and work is curiosity. You have a show called Cred Curiosity. You often talk about the power
[00:13] of curiosity. I'm just curious, why is curiosity so important to you and why is it important
[00:18] for other people to always stay curious and what value is there?
[00:22] I think a curious person is somebody who is constantly demonstrating that they are not
[00:30] proud of their expertise and they will demonstrate extraordinary amount of excitement when they
[00:37] face a problem which they have no clue how to solve. And therefore a lot of people stop
[00:44] growing because they want to constantly demonstrate their expertise versus demonstrate
[00:50] their curiosity. Because curiosity should come from security because imagine I'm the founder
[00:59] CEO of this company and this group of 60 people on WhatsApp, somebody post something and ask
[01:03] a dumb question, what does this word mean? You need to have the security to feel okay
[01:09] with it. But a lot of people out of insecurities try to demonstrate expertise and do it or
[01:15] Google not ask these people. I think that slows down the compounding growth.
[01:19] And I think it keeps you very good at adapting. So it's funny, I was recently, GPT is my favorite
[01:30] thing to keep asking random questions because now I don't need to really worry about Google
[01:34] having those questions answered around because I can ask the GPT. So I recently asked the
[01:38] question that which animals have managed to survive, which species or animals have
[01:42] survived for more than 100 million years without changing too much and what is common
[01:46] in all of them. So GPT came up with an interesting answer which says that it sharks, like horseshoe
[01:53] crab, crocodiles and all of these people have survived to do this thing. So three distinct
[02:00] traits were one ability to reduce metabolism at will. It's fascinating. I can bring down
[02:11] my metabolism by 20%, like one is to 20 or like crazy, crazy scale, they can bring the
[02:18] metabolism down. The second one is by the way, a lot of in ancient yogis have demonstrated
[02:24] this as well. It comes from the same yogic practice. The second thing is about and
[02:29] if you think on companies context is the same. If COVID came, did you could you could
[02:33] do so on your metabolism and survive or you burnt your way out of there and disappeared.
[02:41] The second thing that was interesting was very high conversion rate on every attempt
[02:46] to secure food. They don't go around chasing randomly and doing things. They have a very
[02:53] high conversion rate, which means high judgment and the deadliest bite. So they
[03:01] will not chase many options, but if they chase something, they will have the biggest bite
[03:04] on it and they'll convert it. And the third thing that was more interesting one was they
[03:09] have survived all sorts of crazy environmental changes. Just adapting and adaptation comes
[03:17] from curiosity. Right. And you could see those people in COVID. There were two sets
[03:24] of people who were completely gone into shell. And they were like, who are like
[03:28] this curious like, okay, so what do I do with this? Like, what happens now? Like, do I
[03:32] need to train something? Do I need to treat something? So it was changed very quickly.
[03:38] So I often feel that curiosity is that demonstration to adapt and learn and you only
[03:47] create more information asymmetry. To me, wealth is nothing but information asymmetry.
[03:53] All the best companies in the world have unfair information asymmetry. And that comes from
[04:00] curiosity because you're constantly collecting dots, connecting dots, collecting dots,
[04:06] connecting dots and end up creating this unique edge for yourself and information asymmetry
[04:12] for yourself. And if you assume that I have collected enough, I mean, there's no human
[04:18] life is going to be enough to connect and connect all the dots. Like, we never be able
[04:23] to get and sometimes I envy the stuff that you do because you're like, you're efficiently
[04:28] connecting and collecting dots by having luxury of all these people to talk to and you are
[04:35] making more dots getting connected. So your information asymmetry is growing.
[04:39] Wait till you IPO and then someday maybe leave credit and then you could start this
[04:44] podcast of your own like this and connect all the dots. And I think that's a reference to
[04:49] Danny Meyer, who's the founder of all these fancy restaurants and big on hospitality and
[04:54] as this phrase always be collecting dots, I think ABCD.
[04:57] Nice.
[04:58] Yeah. Okay, wait, this is really interesting, this list of what are the common traits of
[05:04] the most long lasting animals. They can lower their metabolism at will. They have
[05:09] a high conversion rate to get food and they've survived many types of environments and I
[05:14] think there's a lot you can transform as you've done to start ups and leaders. This
[05:19] could be its own. If you haven't written about this, this would be a cool blog post.
