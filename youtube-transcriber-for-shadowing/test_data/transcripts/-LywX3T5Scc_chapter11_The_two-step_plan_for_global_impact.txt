============================================================

[00:00] Okay, something else that I know is really important to you and also really unique to
[00:04] Canva is something that's called the two step plan.
[00:07] You mentioned this earlier.
[00:08] I want to definitely talk about this.
[00:10] What is the two step plan?
[00:11] Why is this so important to you?
[00:13] Yeah, so when you were asking about crazy big goals, I think this is our most macro,
[00:18] most crazy biggest goal.
[00:20] Step one, build one of the world's most valuable companies and step two, do the most good we
[00:23] can do.
[00:24] And in our early days, I thought I'd do step one and then step two and realize that actually
[00:30] step one can fuel step two and step two can fuel step one.
[00:34] And so that's been a really big part of Canva for some years now.
[00:38] In the early days, we took the 1% pledge, which I think is an incredible program.
[00:41] Every single person, every single company should take that where you give 1% of time,
[00:46] money, equity and profitability.
[00:49] And I think that's a really easy thing to do in the early days that then can compound
[00:53] greatly over time.
[00:54] We also knew that Canva's equity was obviously going to be a really key part of it.
[00:58] So Cliff and I owned a little over 30% of Canva and so we decided we were going to take
[01:03] 30% of Canva and use it to do the most good we can do.
[01:06] And we are doing that.
[01:09] So we're doing all of our donating through the Canva Foundation.
[01:11] We've just over the last few years, we've donated $50 million to GiveDirectly where
[01:16] they give money directly to people in Malawi who are in extreme poverty.
[01:20] And then they can use that money on their family to go to school, to get healthcare,
[01:25] to start small businesses, to get a roof so they can sleep in without being wet.
[01:31] Just like real, truly basic human needs things.
[01:34] And we've just announced that we're going to be giving another $100 million over the
[01:39] next four years to people in extreme poverty.
[01:43] And it's just like when you go and sit with people and you hear about how they're spending
[01:49] what's very microscopic amount at $550, it doesn't buy us that much but it's a life-changing
[01:56] amount of money for people in extreme poverty and it's truly transformational what it can
[02:01] do.
[02:02] And you meet people and you hear their stories and it's truly the best money I could ever
[02:07] imagine spending.
[02:09] And that crazy big dream I was mentioning earlier of everyone having basic human needs
[02:13] met, it's so completely insane that that isn't the case today.
[02:19] There's no specific reason why people don't have their basic human needs met on our planet
[02:23] but we just haven't got to act together as humanity.
[02:25] And so that is a truly crazy big dream.
[02:29] But back to the two-step plan, step one, build one of the world's most valuable companies
[02:33] and step two, do the most good we can do.
[02:36] And finding ways to do that at the same time I think is extraordinarily important.
[02:40] That's incredible.
[02:41] It makes me think about not to mention Elon again but Elon's three-step strategy plan
[02:46] and it's like build better cars versus this is like, okay, solve all the problems of the
[02:51] world and make the world a better place.
[02:54] What a better master plan.
[02:57] And something else about this that I love is a lot of companies have this, have something
[03:01] philanthropic going on with the company and it's like sitting in a dock on some page as
[03:04] part of their mission.
[03:06] It's not actually that big of a deal to them.
[03:08] What I hear from folks at Canva is something you talk about all the time.
[03:10] This is like an actually core part of how you work and think and how you set goals and
[03:15] set vision and missions.
[03:16] Yeah.
[03:17] I'm happy to hear that.
[03:18] I wouldn't do Canva if it wasn't going to have a positive impact on the world.
[03:24] Like for me, getting really rich is not a goal unto itself whatsoever.
[03:28] It's a means to an end.
[03:30] And I've been very blessed to be able to do some work and that creates wealth that can
[03:37] then go and have people's basic human needs met.
[03:39] It's completely...
[03:41] But they're working just as hard, but they don't have the opportunity.
[03:45] And even education product is now used by 100 million people each month.
[03:51] And we are in most school districts and rolled out across countries and being able to bring
[03:56] quality education tools to every...
[03:58] And we give that away for free as well.
[04:01] Being able to help empower schools all around the world and we're going to be doubling down
[04:05] and doubling down into that product to bring quality education to all.
[04:09] I think it gives so much more meaning behind work.
[04:12] We've also...
[04:13] Between our education product and our nonprofit program where we also give away our paid product
[04:17] for free, we're giving away $1.5 billion of product a year now.
[04:21] And so the impact that that can have and the ripple effect of that I think is pretty great.
[04:26] And I think for all...
