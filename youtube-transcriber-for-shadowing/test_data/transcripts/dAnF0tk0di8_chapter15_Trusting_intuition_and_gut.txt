============================================================

[00:00] You mentioned also that you have no growth goals, that you make decisions a lot on instinct and gut
[00:07] and opinion, which sounds amazing. It's great if you could pull it off. It feels also very hard
[00:12] to operationalize and maybe make the best decisions in times. Can you just talk about how
[00:17] you actually operationalize that and what you find happens when you approach things that way?
[00:21] I will just admit that that's the only way I've ever known how to work.
[00:24] I don't know how to make decisions by numbers or I don't find any joy in it, frankly. I've always
[00:32] been intuition driven and gut driven and frankly, to be honest, I think everyone actually is.
[00:38] And this is part of the thing I want to write up. I've been thinking about writing about this.
[00:43] I think everything's a judgment call. And so data can play a part. All sorts of things can
[00:50] play a part. But unless you're letting a machine make the decision that's purely rational, if you're
[00:55] asking a human to make it, it's a judgment call. They're bringing to bear thousands of things they
[01:00] know and don't know about that influence them about this particular decision. And it's why,
[01:06] like when companies hire executives, what are they looking for an executive? They typically
[01:11] judgment and experience. They're not like they can read an Excel spreadsheet. That's not the
[01:16] thing that matters. Like anyone can read that or anyone can read a chart or you can learn to do that.
[01:21] They're looking for judgment and experience, which is a very amorphous thing. It's like,
[01:28] what is it really? Well, they've been around. They've seen a lot of things. They've absorbed
[01:32] a lot of experiences and they're going to bring those undescribable things to bear
[01:39] to make decisions for the business. So out of all the things, data might be one thing.
[01:46] But there's thousands of things that go into a decision, many of which you don't even know.
[01:51] And I just feel like I'm comfortable admitting that, that I don't really know why I'm making these
[01:57] calls, but I'm making these calls regardless. And I'm not looking at a number and going,
[02:03] if this is 51% versus 49, I'm going this way for sure. That could be an input perhaps,
[02:09] but it's not the only input. And I think people should recognize that it's,
[02:14] even if you're a data-driven person, there's so much more at play here.
[02:19] So I just feel like just being honest about that and that's sort of how I've always looked at it.
[02:23] And I also will admit, as I just mentioned, I don't know the things that go into my
[02:28] decision-making process, but I'm absolutely fascinated by decision-making. I think it's
[02:32] one of the most interesting human endeavors. And I would just say that give your intuition
[02:38] credit. Give your gut credit. It's absorbed everything and plus the things that you don't
[02:46] know that absorb that are valuable.
