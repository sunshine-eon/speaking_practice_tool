============================================================

[00:00] Awesome.
[00:01] I love that.
[00:02] Coming back to this bootstrap path, there's a lot to love about it, independence with
[00:08] that trickles down all these things that you're able to do with your company that other companies
[00:11] aren't able to.
[00:12] For someone that's thinking about going down this path and wants to bootstrap their company
[00:16] and that doesn't have a lot of money because it takes cash to start a business, do you
[00:19] have any advice for just how to get started down this path?
[00:21] Yeah.
[00:22] First of all, it's hard.
[00:23] This is hard.
[00:24] I mean, wouldn't you have nothing, especially like if it depends where you are in your
[00:26] life too?
[00:27] You may have a couple of kids and you don't have a lot of time and you got to pay mortgage
[00:32] and it's tough.
[00:34] So this is hard, but it's the reality for almost every business in the world that starts.
[00:38] So the best advice I could give you is, and this sounds so trite, but really it's true,
[00:44] is stay as small as you can for as long as you can.
[00:47] The only thing you can really control are your costs.
[00:51] You can't control the alternatives in the market, the competition.
[00:55] You can't control them.
[00:56] You can't determine the market itself.
[00:58] You can't control the economy.
[01:01] You can't control how much advertising costs, but you can control your own costs.
[01:08] And the other thing I would encourage people to do is figure out how to do as much as
[01:11] they can on their own before they bring on a second person.
[01:15] Really work and struggle through something on your own.
[01:19] The moment you bring on someone else, you've got another mouth to feed.
[01:22] It becomes expensive.
[01:23] You get another personality to deal with.
[01:25] The more you rely on them and if they turn out to be the wrong person, you have to lose
[01:28] them.
[01:29] You don't have anyone to do the work that now you have them doing and now you got to
[01:32] do it.
[01:33] You're not going to be any good at it.
[01:34] So I would just, you know, you got to start as small as you possibly can and do
[01:37] much of the work, as much of the work yourself as you possibly can and keep your costs
[01:40] in check.
[01:41] Don't spend any money on branding.
[01:43] Don't go get an office.
[01:45] Don't spend anything on anything, basically, except like the tool you use.
[01:49] Let's say it's your laptop or whatever you're going to use.
[01:53] Get a good one.
[01:54] They don't cost much anymore, 1500 bucks or something like that and get a really
[01:57] nice MacBook Air or whatever.
[01:59] And like, you know, you need an internet connection and maybe you need to host
[02:01] somewhere or whatever.
[02:02] But like, use Squarespace to set up your site for 15 bucks a month or whatever.
[02:06] Like don't go hire a web designer.
[02:09] Find all the efficiencies and keep your costs incredibly low and don't make
[02:15] things hard on yourself.
[02:16] This is the other thing that all businesses at every stage need to keep in mind.
[02:21] While it's hard, things are relatively simple until you make them complicated.
[02:26] Simple can also be hard, but complicated is a lot harder.
[02:31] And I think Brian had a really, Chesky had a really good bit on this, I think, on
[02:34] your podcast about like how companies get complicated.
[02:37] And I loved that.
[02:39] And when I was hearing it, I kept hearing of this unfolding, this complex
[02:43] shape that you almost can't fold back.
[02:48] It's so complicated now that you don't even see where it came from.
[02:51] And now it is what it is and you can't put it back in the bottle and it's just
[02:54] a mess, right?
[02:55] This happens really quickly and it can happen at a small scale too.
[02:59] So these are a bunch of things and none of this
