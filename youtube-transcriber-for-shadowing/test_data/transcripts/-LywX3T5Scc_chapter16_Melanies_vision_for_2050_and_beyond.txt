============================================================

[00:00] Yeah, I like it.
[00:01] This is reminding me of you mentioned earlier in our conversation, you have this vision
[00:05] board that you set as like for 2050, is that right?
[00:08] Yeah, that's right.
[00:09] Can you share something from that vision board?
[00:11] I'll tell you why the vision board came about because it's only been in recent months.
[00:17] I did feel like as humanity we are on a bit of a freight train and that freight training
[00:22] is, I think if we take a lot of visions for a lot of different companies and a lot of
[00:26] things that are happening and you just fast forward 50 years or you do 2050 and you say,
[00:32] are we in a safer world?
[00:34] Is the world the place that we want our kids to grow up in?
[00:38] Is this the humanity that we want?
[00:41] I didn't feel that the train that we are headed on always feels great.
[00:46] In fact, it scared me quite greatly for a whole host of reasons and so I sat with that
[00:53] feeling for a little and then I kind of got to work on my 2050 walls and back to the chaos
[00:59] to clarity.
[01:00] The first thing was riding my 2050 wall and I've kind of really been loving, I've got
[01:05] a whole, on the 2050 wall started with a lot of quotes.
[01:09] Everything good was once imagined and many other quotes are along those similar lines
[01:15] and then rather than just being fearful of the things that I'm worried about for society
[01:20] and for humanity, I started to think like, what would the alternative be?
[01:24] What is that vision that I would love to see us have?
[01:28] Basic human needs for all.
[01:31] Global education being a basic human right that everyone experiences.
[01:36] All the really important things that we want as humanity.
[01:40] And again, like using vision and using imagination and just dreaming about the future.
[01:46] And I find it really fascinating in my day to day back, literally having it beside me
[01:49] as I work every day.
[01:51] The little tiny decisions that can kind of help to angle towards that future that we
[01:55] want and can I help will any of that into existence?
[02:01] I honestly don't know.
[02:03] But I feel like just by starting to write it down, some little brainstorm exercise with
[02:08] a number of other people and starting to just like etch out like how do we get closer and
[02:12] closer to that?
[02:14] On my vision of the future, it's community.
[02:17] It's the whole of humanity trying to dream bigger and to dream bigger goals and then
[02:22] us actually rising to that occasion.
[02:24] In the world we don't want, I think loneliness is right.
[02:29] Purpose is gone.
[02:30] What we teach people in schools is pointless.
[02:34] And in my vision for 2050, it's none of those things.
[02:39] Communities are bound to fall.
[02:41] We all have deep purpose.
[02:43] And that deep purpose springs from having bigger dreams that we collectively go out
[02:47] and achieve.
[02:48] With something that we're doing at our Canva World tour keynote in two weeks time, which
[02:55] I think is going to be after this is released, we've been asking people what is one goal
[03:00] you'd like to see the world achieved in our lifetime?
[03:03] And then people literally writing it down, I think is pretty powerful.
[03:09] And then people sharing that with other people, I think is pretty powerful.
[03:12] And then us actually figuring out how the hell do we turn that reality that we all deeply
[03:15] desperately want into existence?
[03:17] I think is genuinely one of the biggest questions of our time.
[03:21] But then again, rather than trying to tackle that entire thing by yourself, how do you
[03:25] take that first tiny step that starts to see that in your own life, in your own family,
[03:30] in your own community?
[03:31] And I think that's where we'll get purpose from.
[03:34] And I think that is one of the key answers to loneliness is actually working towards
[03:38] something bigger than yourself.
[03:40] Wow.
[03:41] I really appreciate you sharing all that.
[03:43] I was thinking as you're talking, just considering how wildly successful Canva has been and just
[03:48] how ambitious that was when you started, I would not be at all surprised that this actually
[03:52] happens in the YouTube, this very difficult vision.
[03:56] It's not something that I alone can achieve.
[03:58] I think we, it has to be obviously a global collective effort because there's zero chance
[04:04] I can go and achieve basic human needs for all.
[04:07] But I think that I'd like to change that.
[04:09] I'd like to help change the mood.
[04:12] I'd like to help change the way we're thinking about things.
[04:17] I genuinely think there's a little, we need to move course a little and decide not what
[04:22] are all the things that we kind of like, what's the freight train we're currently on, but
[04:28] what is it that we actually want?
[04:30] What do we want our societies to look like?
[04:32] What do we want the world to look like?
[04:34] Is it good enough that there's people, hundreds of millions of people that can't eat?
[04:38] What the hell?
[04:39] It just literally makes no sense.
[04:41] A column B world, you might say.
[04:44] Absolutely.
