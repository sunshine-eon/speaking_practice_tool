============================================================

[00:00] I appreciate it. Congrats to you too, Brian. Things seem to be going great. I'm excited
[00:04] that you're here. I want to start with the elephant in the room for a lot of listeners
[00:08] of this podcast. What is going on with product management at Airbnb? You made some comments
[00:13] at FigmaConfig. A lot of people got this impression that you eliminated product management Airbnb.
[00:20] I've heard from a lot of product execs having boardroom conversations as a result of that.
[00:25] They were trying to decide, should we remove product management from the company? Should
[00:29] we significantly cut product management? I'm just curious to hear from you. What is the
[00:33] latest on your thinking on product management and what's happening with product management
[00:37] at Airbnb? I spoke at Figma four or five months ago. I spoke to a room of designers. I then
[00:45] got off stage. I saw people, somebody tweet that said something to the nature of that
[00:52] I said I got rid of the product management function, all the desires that have started
[00:56] cheering. I want to talk about two things. What I actually meant because I didn't actually
[01:02] get rid of the people and also why did the people in the room cheer? That's also a thing
[01:08] we should ask ourselves. I hope everyone listening to this podcast should understand where did
[01:12] that place come from? That 5,000 desires in the room cheered because I thought I eliminated
[01:17] the existence of a function. If I said I eliminated the engineering function, no one would have
[01:22] cheered. It was specifically that function. I want to talk about what that might mean.
[01:26] It wasn't the people. It's the way they're working together. We don't have any longer
[01:31] the traditional product management function as it existed with even yours here. We didn't
[01:37] get rid of people helping drive the product. What we did is we combined what one might
[01:44] call the inbound product development, responsibilities of product manager with the outbound or marketing
[01:50] responsibilities of product marketing. That's the first thing we did. The second thing we
[01:55] did is we off-boarded much of the program management functions that product managers
[02:00] may do to actual program managers. A lot of people, the product management title are
[02:05] actually program managers. We actually started off-boarding some responsibilities to program
[02:10] manager. The last thing we did is we made the group smaller and more senior. We don't
[02:15] really have a lot of junior product marketers. The most senior people are called product
[02:20] marketers, but everyone has to understand how to talk about the product. The basic idea
[02:24] is this. You can't build a product unless you know how to talk about the product. You
[02:29] can't be an expert in making the product unless you're also an expert in the market of it.
[02:33] A lot of companies, what they do is they ship a product. It doesn't work. They say, we tried
[02:38] that. It didn't work. If you say you tried it, it didn't work. My question is, was it
[02:42] a bad product, a bad strategy, or bad execution? Maybe it was a really well-made product, but
[02:47] you had no distribution plan. You had no way to talk about the product. If you build a
[02:51] great product and no one knows about it, did you even build a product?
[02:55] That is essentially what we do. We have a much smaller function. The people are much
[02:59] more senior. They have much more responsibility. The other thing though is that they do not
[03:04] control or drive designing or engineering. We are a fairly purely functional model. They
[03:09] manage by influence. They do not have control. Now, you might ask, how does that work in
[03:15] a company where people can only manage by influence? Here's the amazing thing. We built
[03:20] and designed a company where you can manage by influence and no one has to like you. You
[03:24] don't actually have to win people over. The last thing I want to say is, why did 5,000
[03:31] designers cheer when the people thought I removed the product management function? I
[03:36] don't know if I can speak on behalf of all the designers, but having talked to a lot of
[03:40] designers, I think designers in the Valley are very, very frustrated with the product
[03:45] development process. Not to say the product managers, but they're extremely frustrated.
[03:51] I think a lot of designers feel like they're compromising. Many designers I know, heads
[03:55] of design, well-known heads of design, I told them they're not designers. They're design
[04:00] administrators. They're running a design service organization.
