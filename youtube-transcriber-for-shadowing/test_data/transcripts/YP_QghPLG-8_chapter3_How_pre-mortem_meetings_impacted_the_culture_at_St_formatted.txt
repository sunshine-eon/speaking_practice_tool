============================================================

So it's a good segue to kind of shifting to talk about the five big ideas. The first is around this concept of pre-mortems. There's something that stuck with me when you tweeted it. I think it was a couple of years ago at this point, and I see it come up occasionally in your tweets and amongst people chatting in your super follower threads. I also like that there's something you can actually implement and act on pretty quickly and see impact. 

I'm curious to kind of hear your thoughts on this idea of pre-mortems. Just unpack this idea for folks. Yeah, we're all familiar with a post-mortem or, as they call it in the military, after-action reviews, right? Every company I've worked at has had some form of post-mortem. When a launch had problems or an initiative did not go as planned, or we suffered an unacceptable system downtime, somebody would say, "Oh, we need to post-mortem that." 

Over the years, I really saw the effectiveness of a post-mortem. Some really great insights came out of a post-mortem about what went wrong and what we could have done better. As I saw the effectiveness of a post-mortem, that's what made me wonder, why do we need to wait until after things go wrong? Why can't we extract some of these insights before they go wrong? 

It was around that time that I discovered the idea of a pre-mortem. I learned about it from a Harvard Business Review article written by Gary Klein. The idea is simple: when you are working on an important project or initiative, you get together with your team early on in the product's or project's life to see in advance what could go wrong. 

The way I describe a pre-mortem is that if you do a pre-mortem right, you will not have to do an ugly post-mortem. You might still do a post-mortem to learn, but odds are very high that it is not going to be a bad post-mortem. The genius of the pre-mortem ritual is the initial prompt. It's not just about, "Well, what could go wrong?" The initial prompt is the genius, which is: imagine this project that we are working on has failed six months from now. 

Let's just all imagine that. Now let's work backwards from there and ask ourselves what went wrong? What could have contributed to this utter failure? That's how a pre-mortem meeting will start. The leader will start with this prompt, and then the way the meeting goes is you ask your team members to share what could have caused this utter failure. 

The magic of this type of approach, where you work backwards from a hypothetical failed outcome, is that it somehow enables two things. One is much greater psychological safety for team members to talk about things they're concerned about, but that they were just hesitant to bring up because nobody likes to be negative in modern organizations. Everybody wants to be optimistic and positive. 

So a pre-mortem setting gives everybody the license to actually think about what can go wrong. That psychological safety is a big factor in why a pre-mortem works. At Stripe, I did this regularly with launches that my team was involved in. Sometimes some teams or some people were just surprised or skeptical, like, "Is it really going to work?" 

Then we go through the pre-mortem meeting, and there's a whole process that we can talk about. But as we complete the meeting, I ask everybody, "So how did that go?" Just everybody's smiling, even though we've spent, say, 30 minutes or an hour just talking about terrible scenarios of things that could go wrong. But everybody's feeling a little lighter because it's great catharsis. 

The last thing I found with pre-mortems, now that I've done them with various other companies as well that I advise, is the shared vocabulary. The shared vocabulary that you get about being able to talk about things that will fail is crucial. I have a specific approach, which is I ask the team to talk about three things. Each member on the team should bring up three things. 

One is a tiger. You can bring up tigers in the shared document that we create. A tiger is a threat that will actually kill us, just like a tiger would. These are actual problematic things that could be really harmful to the product or the project. The other is a paper tiger. This is a seeming threat that others might be worried about, but you're not worried about. 

Then the last one, and I think this one was also used at Airbnb in other ways, is the elephant. The elephant is the elephant in the room that nobody's talking about. It might not be a tiger; it won't kill us. But you're still worried that we are not seeing reality as it is. An elephant could be, "Well, we are assuming that just because we launch this and do a bunch of PR that we'll get users." 

But are we sure we're going to get users? That's kind of like the elephant in the room that nobody's talking about. Again, this gives you that psychological safety to bring it up. What I noticed as I ran pre-mortems is that in future meetings that the team had where I wasn't even present, people started talking about, "Oh, I have this tiger. Can I bring up this tiger?" 

All of a sudden, it became okay for people to bring those things up, which I think is perhaps the best part about a pre-mortem: the shared vocabulary.
