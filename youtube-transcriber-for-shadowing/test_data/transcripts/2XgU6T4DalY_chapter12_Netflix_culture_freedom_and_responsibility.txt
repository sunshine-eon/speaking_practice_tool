[00:00] So asked on Twitter, what questions to ask you.
[00:04] And there's a great question that came in from non-you.
[00:07] He's the head of product for Linear.
[00:09] And he asks, what practices does Netflix do that other companies should not attempt to do
[00:15] because their talent level is so much higher than other companies?
[00:20] That is freedom and responsibility in a nutshell.
[00:25] So let me explain that.
[00:28] It's a good question.
[00:30] And it's kind of related to what I was saying earlier that talent density is a prerequisite for a lot of the other ways we operate.
[00:38] So if we want to create a work environment where we are not prescriptive about how people solve problems
[00:52] or the scope of problems that they could tackle, assuming they're highly impactful for the business.
[00:59] And we don't have a lot of process around that work.
[01:03] So think about being able to make large innovations to our engineering systems
[01:12] or introducing new ways to think about metrics and experimentation.
[01:17] We get a lot of those things because we give people the freedom and the space to explore and question things and experiment in a way with solutions.
[01:30] And I think that that would be very hard, if not dangerous, if we didn't have a high talent density.
[01:38] It's really not a top down, do A then B then C.
[01:43] Even in how we go through some of our planning processes or thinking about how we think about priorities,
[01:51] there is a lot of room for contribution across all levels of the team, and that requires talent density.
[01:58] And then there's things like, you know, you have to have amazing people if you're not going to have really strict guardrails
[02:04] that would influence the consumer experience or business stakeholders experience.
[02:08] And we do give people a lot of responsibility on those things.
[02:12] So I think the lack of process and prescriptiveness is all hinging on.
[02:18] We've got amazing people who are smart, but even better have strong judgment.
