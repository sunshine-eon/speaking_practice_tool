Time: 00:00 - 04:22
============================================================

[00:00] Microsoft, Adobe, Alphabet, IBM, Palo Alto Networks, even Starbucks.
[00:04] The CEOs of these companies were all born in India and emigrated to the US.
[00:08] A lot of CEOs are done well because they follow the
[00:11] Dharma of the founders quite well. These are the principles were given to me,
[00:14] and I'm going to sustain this and make it even bigger.
[00:16] I want to keep talking about India and how it's different,
[00:18] and how to build products that are successful in India.
[00:21] No Indian has ever been paid an hourly salary in their entire life.
[00:24] The concept of time is not the same.
[00:27] What do you see as the biggest opportunity for Indian startups?
[00:30] India is changing because now, for the first time,
[00:32] we're seeing founders being respected and unicorns being celebrated.
[00:36] We have a national startup day and probably the first generation
[00:39] that will have to prove ourselves to be very large profitable companies.
[00:42] I wouldn't want to be anywhere else in building.
[00:48] Today, my guest is Kunal Shah.
[00:51] Kunal is one of the most well-known and respected entrepreneurs
[00:55] and product leaders in India and around the world.
[00:58] He shares endless wisdom on Twitter and LinkedIn,
[01:01] where he's got over 1 million followers.
[01:03] He's the CEO and founder of CRED, a fintech startup based in India,
[01:08] which was last valued at over $6 billion,
[01:11] and is of a couple years ago processed over 20%
[01:13] of all credit card bill payments in India.
[01:16] Prior to CRED, he founded three other startups,
[01:18] including FreeCharge, which he sold for over $400 million to Snapdeal.
[01:23] Kunal is a deep thinker, both about product and about life.
[01:27] His background is actually in philosophy,
[01:30] which comes across very clearly when you hear him share his advice.
[01:34] In our conversation, we get deep into what makes working
[01:37] and building in India different from the US markets and other markets,
[01:41] including why trust is so essential
[01:43] and why so many people are so much more risk-averse in India.
[01:46] We talk about the biggest challenges and opportunities within the India market,
[01:50] why there are so many successful Indian immigrants in CEO roles across tech,
[01:55] and what we can learn from that.
[01:56] Also, why companies in India can quickly grow DAOs, but not ARPUs,
[02:01] and what that means for building products in India.
[02:03] We also talk about how to stay curious and open-minded
[02:06] in the power of second-order thinking,
[02:07] also stories of failure and lots of contrarian takes,
[02:11] and so much more.
