============================================================

If you're a founder, what I would tell you is the problem with finding a negotiation between how you want to run the company and the people you want is that it's a good way to make everyone miserable. What everyone really wants is clarity. They want to be able to row in the same direction really quickly. Also, if you try to appease employees, they may not even be there for the whole time. We have entire projects in the company where somebody advocated for them, it was a big commitment, and then they left. Now we're still doing the project they advocated for. It really has to be something that everyone wants to sign up for, not just the person who's there, because they might not always be there.

I basically got involved in every single detail and told leaders that leaders are in the details. There's this negative term called micromanagement, but I think there's a difference between micromanagement, which is telling people exactly what to do, and being in the details. Being in the details is what every responsible company's board does to the CEO. That doesn't mean the board is telling them what to do, but if you don't know the details, how do you know people are doing a good job? People think that a great leader's job is to hire people and empower them to do a good job. But how do you know they're doing a good job if you're not in the details? 

So, I made sure I was in the details, and we really drove the product. 

This episode is brought to you by Epo. Epo is a next-generation A-B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Muro, ClickUp, and DraftKings rely on Epo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and understanding the performance of new features. Epo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous, deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does.

When I was at Airbnb, one of the things I valued most was our experimentation platform, where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Epo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shape weeks off experiment time, an accessible UI for diving deeper into performance, and out-of-the-box reporting that helps you avoid annoying, prolonged analytic cycles. 

Epo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the A-B testing flywheel. Epo powers experimentation across every use case, including product, growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing.
