============================================================

[00:00] So many lessons there. I love this idea of a founder being an uncertainty absorber.
[00:05] This other point you made about Zuck becoming the Shiva in destruction touches on something Brian Chesky
[00:11] and I chatted a bit about is how founders often start in control giving
[00:15] very micromanagey just driving the ship and then as the company grows they delegate and power and
[00:21] then things start to slow down and then they come back play the Shiva and and
[00:27] Take control again. Is there anything there that you've seen? Yeah, but that's the universe
[00:31] It's a universe goes through the exact same phases. So if you study Indian mythology, you'll see that there's a Brahma
[00:37] Vishnu Mahesh
[00:38] Ficles and every you can is this gold goes for these three phases all the time
[00:43] Beautiful. I see so this is just inevitable. This is the circle of life
[00:47] Absolutely amazing. I love this all just ties back to your philosophy background. I love it. It's beautiful
