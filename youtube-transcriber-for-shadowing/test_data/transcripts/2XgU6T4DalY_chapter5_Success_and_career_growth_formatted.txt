============================================================

I was looking at your LinkedIn and looking at your career over the years, and it seems like you've had a meteoric rise at four different companies. I'll just walk through them briefly. At your first job, you went from associate to vice president in three years. At the next company, Nuna, you went from manager of data science to COO in two years. At Netflix, you went from VP to CTO in three years. I think that's really rare. I'm curious, what is your secret sauce to being so successful at so many places, and especially in the context of what advice can you share with folks earlier in their career?

This is one of those questions that sparks the reflection that I wouldn't normally do. So that's great. I really don't think of it as a secret sauce, but maybe I can walk through some of the things that I think have been instrumental. As you listed that out, it sounds like the two to three year point is the real sweet spot. So maybe there's something about that timeline. Some things almost feel trite in how I would say them, which is I'm very dedicated to the work and to the teams I'm part of. It's been part of who I am for a long time that I give everything I've got to the job that I'm in. 

That dedication and the joy I get from it has mattered. It matters because I enjoy what I'm doing. I do the best work I possibly can, less so for myself and my own ambition, and more so because I think of myself as being part of a team. I really need to deliver for that team. That framing in my mind and that motivation has helped me in a few fronts, particularly in the way I build partnerships with people I work with. I really care about setting other people up for success and being someone that people want to work with. 

I have found that part of that is being someone that people can leverage to translate from technical to non-technical and non-technical to technical. That has been a relative advantage in my role. While I was often sitting in more technically oriented teams, a lot of the advancement in my career was to roles that required that type of communication fluency. It grew out of being able to partner with people across the businesses who didn't necessarily have the same background, but where we needed to connect spaces so we could be more effective. 

The training for that came from Analysis Group, where it was a very quantitative set of work that we had to find a way to communicate to judges and juries for economic cases. I think I've been able to leverage that. I'm a relatively introverted only child, so I observe a lot, which means that I learn from other people. In each of these roles, I have tried really hard to watch what other people are doing, think about how I could learn something from them, whether it's something I want to be able to do myself or something that doesn't quite fit or feel authentic with my style. 

I do a lot of introspection. I have been surrounded by amazing people in all these roles, and I have a feeling that I learned a lot by osmosis and observation, which has helped me be stronger in the roles I was sitting in. A few things you mentioned are dedication, working really hard, taking your work seriously, being part of a team, setting other people up for success, translating complex tech language and problems to non-tech people, and being really good at observing and learning from others. 

Is there an example or two that you could share to make it even more concrete for people? Like dedication—does that just mean working many hours? Being part of a team—anything along those lines to share a story maybe to help people put this into practice?

No, and it's a good clarification because the dedication piece really isn't about long working hours. It's more about how much I care about excellence. Giving it my best in those situations might not mean that I work really wild hours or weekends, or that I'm the one who's willing to sacrifice vacation. I've actually tried to avoid setting that as an expectation, but more that I hold myself to a very high standard. 

An example would be, especially as I've gotten more senior in roles, there can be an expectation that it's okay for other people to wait on me. Whether it's the timing for a meeting, providing input on something, reviewing a document, or following through on something I said I was going to do, I really try to avoid that. If someone sends me something, I try to be very responsive. If I know that I said I'm going to do something, I follow through on it in the timeline I said I would. If I have a meeting, I try to be on time. Those are all flavors of dedication to the work that show up as, "Oh, it seems like Elizabeth works really hard," but the motivation factor is that other people are relying on me, and I want to show up for them.

For the technical to non-technical part, a great example is actually a very timely one at Netflix. We are making strides to offer live content types, such as live events and live TV shows. We announced this week that we're going to be hosting WWE starting later this year and early next year 2025. That is easier said than done. I know that there are a lot of entertainment companies that have live content, but Netflix has really been in the streaming content business. Live content is something new for us and will require a close partnership between our content organization and our products and technology organization because there's a content strategy, a business strategy, and a technology strategy to it.

A big part of my role is to explain how we're going to approach those technical problems in a way that builds confidence with the content team. I try to understand their content strategy in a way that sets the technical teams up for success, so we understand what we need to deliver in terms of requirements. I don't think I'd be able to do my current role well if I wasn't able to do that type of translation for something that's going to be a big bet for the business and something we want to invest in jointly. I'm going to do everything I can to make sure we deliver well for my content partners because I feel like that's what's best for Netflix.

Amazing examples. In terms of live content, I think about "Love Is Blind." I think there were some issues with that reunion stream.

Yeah, that was about a little less than a year ago now. The amazing thing about failure is you learn a lot. We learned a lot, took notes, and had a couple of successful events after that, including the Netflix Cup last October. We have some exciting events coming up. I think that's something that strengthened us, but it did reveal that we're tackling a hard problem.

Yeah, the Twitter feeds during that "Love Is Blind" reunion were hilarious. People were upset.

In terms of keeping a high bar for yourself, I love that. I think about a quote from VC Ann Murico at Floodgate. She did an interview with Tim Ferriss and shared that her dad always asked her, "Are you doing a world-class job with this? Are you doing a world-class job with your homework? Are you doing a world-class job with your piano recital?" That's the bar he always had for her, and I feel like that's a really good way to think about work and life in general, if you can.

My mother used to describe to me, probably still does, though it required more repeating when I was younger, that the last 5% is the 5% that really mattered. It is that framing of the extra effort you put into something to make it world-class or excellent. I do like to push myself that way, and I hope it sets a good example for other people too. It's very consistent with the company cultures that I tend to thrive in, where that's the general expectation of the culture, so you don't feel like you're doing it alone. Otherwise, I think you can start to feel frustrated by that.
