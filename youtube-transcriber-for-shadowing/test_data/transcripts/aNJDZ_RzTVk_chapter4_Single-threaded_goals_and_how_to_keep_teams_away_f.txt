============================================================

[00:00] fast that say we're like, velocity is really important moving fast is really important to us.
[00:04] But I feel like ramp is different is very different from that where you it's actually
[00:08] incredibly, incredibly fast. And it's actually something you come back to again and again,
[00:12] this idea of how do we move faster? Can you just share an example too of what velocity actually
[00:18] looks like at ramp and and what the reality of that is? Yeah, so when I joined, we were about,
[00:23] you know, 10 ish folks about eight engineers. In three months, we built a competitor to
[00:28] Mx. Six months after that, we build a competitor to to expensify, you know, both public and traded
[00:34] companies. We hit 100 million in annual revenue. I think we're under at that point 50 total in
[00:40] the R&D department, less than four engineers and three PMs. And then we started expanding into
[00:45] accounts payable. We basically gave a team, you know, goal of building a competitor to
[00:50] build.com. It was three engineers, one designer, one PM, three months. And and they hit
[00:55] it out of the park. And that product is moving in billions of dollars a year. And I think, you know,
[01:00] the the the recipe for all this is is constantly, you know, small teams have a single threaded
[01:07] focus. Give them the the resources they need to execute big lofty goals, very tight timelines,
[01:13] and then like shield them from the chaos that is the rest of the organization. So
[01:19] basically, don't bother them and don't even tell the rest of the company that you're
[01:21] doing these things until they find product market fit until they actually find that early
[01:26] traction and then they can bring in more resources to sort of like gravity, right? And you let
[01:32] gravitational pull to this thing. Okay, I want to double click on some of these points you
[01:36] just made. So what you find is important to help teams and people move fast within ramp is
[01:44] you talked about single threaded teams shielding them from other people trying to pull them in
[01:50] different directions, lofty goals. There's a couple more things. Let's talk about the single
[01:53] threaded piece a little bit. What is that? What does actually mean? What does that look like?
[01:57] There are very few people who are able to execute extremely well and more than one thing.
[02:02] And it's especially true for for individual contributors. And so what I mean by single
[02:07] threaded is like, there's only one goal, one threat that they're they're waking up in the
[02:11] morning to focus on. And in order to remove that, you basically need to remove anything
[02:17] else that they're being asked to do to just focus on that thing, whether it's, you know,
[02:22] any type of research, any type of production engineering, or any type of process that's
[02:26] outside of that single goal. And you know, it almost goes as far as like you just like
[02:32] saving a room in the office just for them. And they are just in that room all day,
[02:37] every day, just working on that one thing. What's an example that either some maybe
[02:41] someone's working on an hour in the past that's like a good example of a single threaded
[02:45] goal or team? Yeah, so for example, we we launched a flex product over the last summer,
[02:53] that was a single threaded team, just focused on e-commerce companies and their needs with
[02:59] more cash flow conversion and cash flow smoothing. And so we kept that team,
[03:03] again, just purely focused on just shipping that product and hitting that goal.
[03:08] If they were ever distracted by something else, I don't think we would have hit it.
[03:12] How do you as a leader avoid distracting them knowing there's so many things
[03:17] you need to do? And there's constantly this like, oh, if we just fix this one bug,
[03:22] this one customer is going to be so happy. And okay, if I just asked this 1pm to work on this
[03:26] for a day, I know there's not going to be like, here's the rule, step 123. But how do you
[03:30] actually approach shielding teams from from things that just are constantly on fire?
[03:34] So we have, for example, on bugs or issues like that, we have, we have individuals that
[03:39] are protecting those teams from those issues. So, you know, we have rotational program on
[03:43] production engineering, for example, where our engineers are protecting the core team
[03:47] from escalations from bugs from issues. We have product operators that are protecting
[03:53] the PM from the chaos that is, you know, documentation and escalations and release
[03:58] management and and enablement customer requests. So we have layers of protective
[04:05] tissue to core teams. But I would say like, for any of these like big bets,
[04:09] you basically have to pull folks from different teams and reorganize a sub a sub team. And that
[04:14] team typically doesn't have responsibility on any existing product, because these are all
[04:18] fairly new products. I think it gets more challenging when you go from one to two,
[04:23] rather than zero one. You also mentioned this idea of lofty goals. And that's
[04:26] something I've seen a lot at Airbnb. There is a very known
