============================================================

So let's talk about AI first. It feels like there's this sense of being in the right place at the right time. It seems like you guys have been building this for a while, and then AI just unlocked another stage in what you're able to do with email. I guess just talk about what you've done and how you think about AI integrating into what you're doing, and how it's enabled you to kind of take off again.

It's true that sometimes startups boil down to being in the right place at the right time. We actually had a massive AI launch recently, about two weeks ago. But even before then, we had multiple flagship AI features. Our first AI feature was "Write with AI," which allows you to drop down a few words and turn them into a fully written email. We actually match the voice and tone in the emails you've already sent. So, unlike Copilot, unlike Gemini, and unlike basically every other email app, the email sounds like you. This AI feature is way more popular than I expected it to be; on average, today, users are using it 37 times per week.

Number two, our next AI feature was "Auto Summarize," which shows a one-line summary above every conversation. As new emails arrive, it updates instantly. Again, unlike Copilot and Gemini, it's pre-computed. One of the things we do is go above and beyond to make these features really premium and feel amazing. The next AI feature after that was "Instant Reply." Imagine waking up to an inbox where every email already has a draft reply. You would simply edit and then send, and sometimes you wouldn't even need to edit. I can share that, because we just finished this analysis, over 2024, the percentage of emails that are AI-written and sent with Superhuman has grown four times, just in one year.

Then, if I remember correctly, the feature after that was "Ask AI." Email, of course, is this treasure trove of critical information—things like project statuses, customer communication, meeting updates, deal execution, and so much more. For over 40 years, we've had to rely on what we literally call Search. You have to remember senders, guess keywords, and scan subject lines. Now you can just ask, "Where is the key one offsite?" or "What are my flight details?" or "What are the top five most positive customer responses to the Ask AI launch?" A task that previously took me 20 or 30 minutes to read through all the emails and create that report is now happening in less than five seconds.

Recently, as I said, we announced our biggest evolution yet. Superhuman AI is constantly helping you. It's organizing your inbox and ensuring you never drop the ball. We have features we call auto labels. You can now write a short prompt like "job applications" or "requests to review work," and then immediately see when emails match that prompt—when people apply for a job or ask you to review work—with auto reminders. If your email needs a response, Superhuman will now automatically set a reminder. You don't have to remember to do that. Then you'll never drop the ball again. All you need to do is hit send; with auto drafts, Superhuman will now automatically draft your follow-up emails for you and will soon be drafting replies to basically every email that needs a response.

Finally, with what we call workflows, you can now turn email into repeatable automated workflows. For example, I often get emails from people who are interested in working at Superhuman. I would normally reply to that candidate and let them know that the team will take a look. I would then forward the original message, including any resume or letter, to our head of people and operations and ask her to reach out if interested. With workflows, I can now automate this entire process. You can imagine a crazy little flowchart of what has to happen. Not only does that save a huge amount of time, but with workflows, you don't even have to be in your inbox. In fact, you don't even have to be working. You could be on vacation while Superhuman AI is working for you.

This sounds like product-market fit to me. This all sounds wonderful; it just makes sense. This is the stuff we've been promised—underwater cities, flying cars, and then just email that works magically and replies for us. I love all these things you're doing for folks that are building with AI. I'm curious about what’s been maybe the biggest surprise, either good or bad, building so deeply on top of AI models that you think might be helpful for folks to watch out for or check out.

I think for me, the biggest surprise has been how unpredictable user love has been in terms of what they love and what they don't love. For example, "Write with AI" sounds like a commodity feature, and on a surface level, it is. Every email app, every writing surface has a "Write with AI" feature in it. I would wager ours is the best at emails, and surprisingly, that's what we do. The surprising thing was just how much people love it and how often it gets used. Thirty-seven times per user per week is still mind-blowing to me; I had not expected that.

On the flip side, there were certain AI features where I did expect a ton of usage, but we didn't quite get the usage that we were perhaps hoping for. Hopefully, I'm not an AI Kramer, but basically everything I thought would work out well, people used less than I thought they would, and everything I was like, "I don't know, but let's build the thing," people love that. So interesting. Maybe I should just create an anti-meet-to-do AI road mapping. That's a simple agent right there. Whatever a whole.
