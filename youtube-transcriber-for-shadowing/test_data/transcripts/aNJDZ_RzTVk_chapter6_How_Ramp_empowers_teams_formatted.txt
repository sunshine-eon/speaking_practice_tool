Teams and give them a lot of control over how they operate and what they build and how they set goals and things like that versus micromanaging them. If they give this concept of context over control, I'm curious how you actually operationalize that. A lot of people love the idea of empowering their teams, and then they do that, and then the team, they just do the wrong thing or they take too long or they set the wrong goals. So how do you actually make that work and create empowerment within your teams?

Yeah, it was one of the biggest cultural differences, I think, in ramp versus other companies that I was a part of, where, you know, my boss, the CTO, was extremely hands-off in terms of the actual product decisions because we were extremely aligned on the goals themselves. And so that's where you really just start alignment: what is the goal that you're going after? What is the hypothesis that you have to reach that goal? What is the data by which you're coming up with that hypothesis? And then what is the potential solution to test that hypothesis?

Oftentimes, you know, more junior leaders, and I was certainly in that camp earlier on, kept focusing on the solutions and debating the right solution. When in fact, you should really be debating upstream of that. You should be debating the interpretation of data, you should be interpreting, debating the hypotheses and the different ideas that you have there as to what's really going on, or you should be debating the goals themselves. 

Whenever things went wrong at ramp, it was when I was being prescriptive with regards to the solution without actually explaining and aligning upstream on the goal, the hypothesis, and the data. If you do that, you realize that the solutions actually can come much better from teams that are much closer to the ground. I think that's the biggest goal that I have now in my role: to continue giving context so that teams focus on the right goals, come up with the right hypotheses, and focus on the right data points.

I spend most of my time just repeating myself, most of my time just sharing the context that I think they might be missing, especially given that I'm in certain meetings or certain groups and certain forums that they're not a part of. My responsibility is to represent them and then share back the context for them to do better and make better decisions over time. That touches on a phrase that's come up a couple of times on this podcast: that a leader's job is essentially to be the repeater in chief, reminding people of strategy and vision.
