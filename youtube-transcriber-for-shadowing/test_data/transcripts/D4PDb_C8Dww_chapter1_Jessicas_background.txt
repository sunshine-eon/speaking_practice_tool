============================================================

[00:00] So you've built one of the largest and most respected data teams in all of tech.
[00:04] For me, analytics is a business impact driving function and not purely a service function.
[00:10] Not just answering the why but answering the what do we do now that we know this.
[00:15] One of your colleagues told me that you're incredibly good at defining metrics.
[00:19] Retention is a terrible thing to goal on. It's almost impossible to drive
[00:23] in a meaningful way in a short term. Ultimately you want to find a short term metric you
[00:28] can measure that drives a long term output. You mentioned the early team I felt extreme ownership.
[00:34] Yes you are a data scientist but your goal is to figure out what's happening and if that means
[00:40] that you're gonna pick up the phone and call customers then that is what you're gonna do
[00:44] to roll up your sleeves. Today my guest is Jessica Lax. Jessica is Vice President of
[00:52] Analytics and Data Science at DoorDash which has built one of the biggest and most impactful
[00:57] data teams in tech. She's been at DoorDash for over 10 years and was the first GM at DoorDash
[01:02] responsible for launching new markets. Previously Jessica founded Get Simple a social
[01:07] gifting startup and began her career in investment banking at Lehman Brothers.
[01:11] In her conversation we go deep on how to build and scale your data org including why a centralized
[01:17] org model is so effective what to look for when hiring data people how to pick the right
[01:22] metrics for teams to align incentives and drive the right sorts of outcomes examples of how the
[01:28] data team at DoorDash has helped the business make better decisions a bunch of great stories about

[01:55] having me I'm very excited to be here. So you've built one of the largest and most respected data
[02:02] teams in all of tech. I've heard from a number of people that look to you for advice when they're
[02:07] trying to build and scale their data teams and then DoorDash in particular is an incredibly
[02:13] complex business there's three or maybe even four sites that the market plays there's this
[02:19] operational elements from the outside it just feels extremely complicated and wild I imagine from the
[02:24] inside it's even more wild. Let's talk about some of the things you've learned about building and
[02:28] scaling the team. You have a fairly contrarian perspective on how to structure data teams
[02:33] this is referenced this was referenced when we had Elizabeth Stone on the podcast too she
[02:37] approaches data the same way so I'd love to hear just your take on how to structure
[02:41] data teams within companies. This episode is brought to you by Webflow. We're all friends here so
[02:48] let's be real for a second we all know that your website shouldn't be a static asset
[02:52] it should be a dynamic part of your strategy that drives conversions that's business 101 but

[03:05] you listening right now that's where Webflow comes in their visual first platform allows you to
[03:11] build launch and optimize web pages fast that means you can set ambitious business goals and your

[03:31] Anvil their document SDK helps product teams build and launch software for documents fast
[03:38] companies like Carta and Vouch Insurance use Anvil to accelerate the development of their
[03:43] document workflows getting to market fast is a top priority for product teams and the last thing
[03:48] that you or your developers want is to build document workflows from scratch it's time consuming
[03:54] expensive and distracts from core work you could stitch together multiple tools and manage
[03:59] those integrations or you can use an all-in-one document SDK most product managers will tell you
