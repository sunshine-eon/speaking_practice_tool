============================================================

Duolingo is a $14 billion company that's hitting all-time highs, too. It just keeps going up. I think it doubled in value in the past six months. Streaks is the most impactful feature. We have right now over 9 million users with a year-plus streak. If you look at the numbers, I think it has been our biggest growth lever. What Duolingo really focuses on is how do we help users build habits around language learning? Getting users to come back the next day is the biggest problem to solve. 

Let's get into the mother load of learnings from the journey of Streaks. We'll talk about the key lessons, insights, and also wrong turns along the way. I'd say, like, test everything. We've run in the last four years over 600 experiments on the streak. So every other day, we've actually set up really good infrastructure for copy testing. We used to say continue, our standard CTAs, and we changed that to commit to my goal, and it was a massive win. There's so much human psychology that you learn through all these experiments about how to motivate people, what motivates, and what demotivates.

Say that you played a mobile game for 3,000 days in a row. I don't know. Maybe that hits a little bit different than saying you've learned Spanish for 3,000 days in a row. Today, my guest is Jackson Shettleworth. Jackson is a group product manager at Duolingo, leading the retention team. This is a different kind of episode that I'm experimenting with, where we spent the entire conversation focused on the journey and lessons of a single feature. In this case, Duolingo Streaks. 

Duolingo is a $14 billion business. Just over the past six months, they doubled in value. They're hitting all-time highs in usage and market cap. They're also one of the very few successful and the single biggest consumer app business in the world. As you'll hear from Jackson, the Streaks feature is the single most impactful feature that most contributed to this growth and success. In other words, you could argue this one feature created billions of dollars of value, which to me means it is worth studying in depth.

In our conversation, Jackson shares the history of the Streaks feature, all of the biggest wins and wrong turns they've taken along the way, what he and his team have learned about what works and doesn't work with the Streaks mechanic, and how they set up their teams to operate in a way that allows them to run over 600 experiments on this product and continue to find big wins. I hope to do more episodes like this on features and products that you'd love to hear more about, so leave a comment either on YouTube or on Substack and tell me which product or feature you'd love to see me cover.

Jackson, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast. 

Yeah, thank you. Long time listener, first-time caller. I appreciate it. So this is going to be a really interesting conversation. I've never done an episode like this before where we basically spent like an hour and a half going into one feature of one product. But this is a very special feature. It's a very special product. Have you ever spent like an hour and a half just talking about this one feature with anyone? 

Well, internally, when we onboard new folks to the team, I actually just did this with somebody that joined the team recently. We spent an hour just talking about the streak. We got through an hour, and I got through about 30% of what I wanted to share. There's just so much. We'll talk about this, but there's so much that we've learned over the years. But never anything externally like this. I think we've shared bits and pieces of learnings, but this will be like the mother load of learnings, hopefully, of how Duolingo goes about the streak. 

We should title this the mother load of learnings of Duolingo Streaks.
