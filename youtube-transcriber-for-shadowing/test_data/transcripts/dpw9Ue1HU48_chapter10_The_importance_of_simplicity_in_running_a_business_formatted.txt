============================================================

The algorithm for seeding is a good example of this. Is there any other examples either in the product or strategy where you pushed for simplicity and then ended up being right? 

Yeah, so on the product side in the early years, and Brian gets credit for the actual implementation of this. We had a relatively broad product, and we can talk about the pros and cons of that even in the early years, but we were solving for simplicity, and we got this from Apple. We'll talk a little bit more about the genesis of this, but we had a rule in the HubSpot product as the product grew in those early years that every time you added what we thought of as a knob or dial called a feature, you had to take one out somewhere else. 

That's a net amount of, and this is a very coarse measurement, right? It's like, okay, well, not every radio button, checkbox, dropdown, or whatever menu item that you put in your nav is necessarily equivalent, but it's better than nothing. It's better than having no constraints. And so, once again, this goes to the kind of binary thing. It just, at least forces you to think about it, right? 

Because the other mistake I think people make in product all the time is that we measure the cost of a feature based on the usual, or even a new product, based on the cost of implementation. That's the first-order thinking, like, oh, this is gonna take six months to develop. It's gonna be Y engineers and Z designers or whatever. Second-order thinking is thinking through the maintenance of that feature. It's like, oh, it's not just the first version that goes live; now we have this code base that we have to support and improve or whatever. 

I get that. The third-order thinking, which I think is the most nuanced and turns out to be the most important, is the other costs that that complexity adds. So, when you go from product number one to product number two, right? It's like, okay, product number two is gonna cost us this much to develop. It's gonna have this risk associated with whether it's successful or not, all these things. 

So there's gonna be this kind of carrying cost for product number two. What companies don't think through is that that is any of the maintenance of that. It's like, oh, we're gonna need a team to kind of maintain that new product. Note what actually happens is that now when you go from product one to two, you have added dimensional complexity to your business. 

What I mean by that is not an incremental increase. Like, oh, we went from one to two. It's like, now every decision you make has to be made through the lens of now we have two products. We just hired an engineer. Do they work on product number one or product number two? We're gonna launch a marketing campaign. Do we spend five minutes talking about product number one and two minutes talking about product number two? How do we do anything? 

Every chart you look at in terms of growth, revenue per whatever, look, it's all of it. Now every chart that you've ever had now has to be sliced by product one and product two in order to really kind of capture that precision. And so now you have this new dimensional complexity that you just hadn't planned on. This applies, once again, at every level of abstraction. 

So everything you do in your business should factor in the long-term cost of that complexity. And it should be worth it. Of course, you need to build product number two and product number N, N plus one over time, but you should be mindful about the cost of that complexity. 

Is there something you've done to help operationalize that? Because I imagine this, everyone's like, yes, this is great. Don't do too many things, simplify. It's hard to do when you're like, oh, we got to drive growth. We have this awesome idea. We have this opportunity. We have a competitor. I know this is part of the culture, so maybe that's the answer. But how do you keep people to actually adhere to this principle? 

So it's really hard. I'll say that. And things that have made it easier, it's a little bit idiosyncratic to HubSpot, right? Part of what has made it easier for us to keep things simple is the early constraints we impose. We didn't know this at the time. Because we're building for SMB, we have a freemium product. 

All right, well, when you're doing that, there is literally a limit to how much complexity you can add because we don't have an army of people that are gonna spend 18 months implementing something. We have to be able to support a product that's free. Like, that's hard to do, right? It has to be simple enough that someone can get value from this thing. 

So there are these kind of self-imposing lessons I would carry away. Come up with systematic ways and mechanisms, as Amazon would call them, of putting guardrails and constraints in to the degree that you can. Because you can put words on a page and try to infuse it in the culture. It's like, oh, we believe in simplicity, we fight for this, and you can have meetings and kind of get up in all-hands meetings and reinforce that, which I encourage you to do. 

But a really, even a reasonably well-done system will outbeat any other mechanism that you can kind of try to infuse, right? Those things kind of deteriorate over time. It's hard to scale them. So I'm a big believer in kind of systems that impose constraints versus just trying to instill the principle.
