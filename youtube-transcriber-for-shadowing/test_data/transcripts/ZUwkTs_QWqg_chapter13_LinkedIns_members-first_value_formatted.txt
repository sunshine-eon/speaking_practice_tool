That made total sense to me. Are there other core values of LinkedIn that are public that you can share? I mean, you can Google them too. They’re very, very public, but probably the one that I think is most important to talk about in this world is this concept of members first. 

Anytime you run an ecosystem as complex as we do, and you think about it, even if you're trying to connect people to opportunity, there are two people involved. How are you going to decide right now who needs it? Having clarity on which piece of the ecosystem is going to be the focus helps us establish a relationship and trust first. It ensures we understand who’s getting access to data and the decisions we may make. I always love that as a principle that we've stuck by. 

Yeah, I see it on the picture. We put members first. So... great, checks out is what you're telling me. Checks out, checks out. What’s interesting is that connecting people to economic opportunity is not one of these values. It seems like it’s even broader, essentially the mission of the company. Got it. Okay. I love that. 

This episode is brought to you by Epo. Epo is a next-generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch, and Cameo rely on Epo to power their experiments. 

Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth team stack. This leads to a waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform, where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, and user stage. 

Epo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Epo lets you go beyond basic click-through metrics and instead use your North Star metrics like activation, retention, subscription, and payments. Epo supports tests on the front end, back end, email marketing, and even machine learning clients.
