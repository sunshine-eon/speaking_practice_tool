============================================================

[00:00] And I'd say like one of the bigger bottlenecks is now they're not integrated into the current way that you have your existing products and so on
[00:09] But it is again better so fast so fast
[00:13] I think the best thing for people who are interested in this or like interested in just being a part of the future economies
[00:21] Get your hands very dirty with these tools because being in the top 10% in using them is going to be to absolutely set you apart in the coming
[00:29] Months and years. So let me follow that thread to say
[00:33] You are magically able to sit next to
[00:37] Everybody that is
[00:38] Using lovable for the first time and you could just whisper a tip in their ear to be successful with lovable
[00:44] What would that tip be it takes a lot to master using tools like lovable and being very curious and
[00:52] Patient and I we have something called chat mode where you can just ask and I like to understand like how does this work?
[00:57] Like is I'm not getting what I'm what I want here
[01:01] Am I missing something? What should I do?
[01:04] is
[01:05] Is is the best way to be productive is also one of the best ways to just learn about how software engineering works
[01:12] Which is and you don't have to write the code anymore
[01:15] But it is useful to understand how software and you or how building products works
[01:19] so that so I think that's the patience and
[01:22] Curiosity is it's a super useful the second part that we spoke about is that being I
[01:30] Would if I would sit next to you I would probably say like hey
[01:34] You're not being super clear here. Like for example, don't say it doesn't work just explain
[01:40] Exactly what you're expecting and which parts are working and which parts are not working
[01:44] And that's a lot of that's something that a lot of people don't do naturally
[01:50] I love that like when you have an engineer you're working with that is a very expensive
[01:55] mistake to miscommunicate something to just forget about a feature to forget about a requirement and here it's
[02:01] You do that and then like 30 seconds later. You're like, oh, okay. Sorry. That was wrong and then you could just try again
[02:07] That's true. It might be more costly with humans
[02:11] Okay, and the first step so the first step is chat mode so you could just so your advice is chat with
[02:16] The what do you call it you call it an agent you got what's like the the term for the thing that you were talking with
[02:23] Yeah, loveable is a name just loveable. Yeah, okay. So you're talking about loveable. By the way, where did you
[02:28] How did you decide on loveable is the name? It's so sweet
[02:32] I think it's all about building
[02:35] I mean a great product. Um, that's what I want more people to be able to do and
[02:42] The best word for a great product is that it's loveable
[02:45] Yeah, the a lot of jargon that I like to use to like emphasize
[02:50] What we should be striving for is building a minimum loveable product
[02:53] And then building a loveable product and they're building an absolutely loveable product
[02:58] So I took that jargon with me in the company name
[03:02] That is great. Absolutely. Loveable product a lp then use the new mvp
[03:07] Okay
