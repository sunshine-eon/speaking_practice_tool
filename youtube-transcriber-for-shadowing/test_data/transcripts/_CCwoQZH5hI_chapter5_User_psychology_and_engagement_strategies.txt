============================================================

[00:00] much of the engagement from this feature.
[00:01] There's so much human psychology that you all learn
[00:04] through all these experiments of just like
[00:06] how to motivate people, what motivates, what demotivates.
[00:09] It was like, you guys should write a book
[00:10] on human psychology and motivation.
[00:13] I feel very much like a amateur armchair psychologist
[00:17] with everything that at least as far as people
[00:20] who want to learn languages on their phone go.
[00:23] Right, right.
[00:24] I really understand those folks.
[00:25] So one kind of theme I'm hearing here so far
[00:28] is you guys are basically just like mining for gold,
[00:31] just like looking for like a vein in some mine.
[00:35] And once you hit it, you're like, ooh, this worked.
[00:37] You just go crazy on just testing all kinds of things
[00:41] to see how far you can take that one little thread.
[00:44] Yeah, and I think, you know, I shared that,
[00:48] how this idea came partially from, you know,
[00:51] monetization, win that they had.
[00:53] I think there's a lot of, you know,
[00:55] because Duolingo runs, you know,
[00:57] I don't know what percentile we're in,
[00:59] but it's got to be a very high percentile of, you know,
[01:02] per capita experiments run for a company,
[01:05] you know, based on company size.
[01:07] We're just constantly learning so many things
[01:09] and there's a really great cross-sharing of monetization
[01:12] to say, hey, this thing worked for us.
[01:13] Is that something you can use?
[01:14] So I'd say it's rare that we go into something
[01:16] where it's just like, well, let's just try something.
[01:18] Typically we have some insight
[01:20] because of all of these experiments that we've run
[01:22] that, hey, if we do this, I don't know,
[01:25] it's one year or it's worked here,
[01:27] it's driven this user engagement.
[01:29] If we, you know, sort of massage that and make it,
[01:32] you know, try in this, you know,
[01:34] scenario or like a different screen,
[01:36] you know, we come in at least
[01:37] with the strong hypothesis that this will work.
[01:39] A lot of times we do look and we're like,
[01:41] you know, a lot of the apps that we look at
[01:42] actually are games themselves.
[01:44] So it's like, all right, you're playing Royal Match
[01:46] or, you know, there's the new Pokemon trading card game
[01:50] that I'm spending way too much time on.
[01:51] You know, you look at these games
[01:53] and see what they're doing
[01:54] and it's really good fodder for what we can do.
[01:57] But a lot of times you're at least going
[01:58] with the strong hypothesis
[01:59] based on what you've seen work elsewhere.
[02:01] You got it.
[02:02] So just to double down on that point,
[02:03] it's not like just random experiments.
[02:04] It's, here's a hypothesis we're fairly confident
[02:07] or has a chance to be true.
[02:09] Let's try it.
[02:09] It's not just like, just try everything.
[02:11] And I think that like,
[02:12] how strongly you feel about the hypothesis
[02:14] directly ties to how hard that experiment is.
[02:17] Like with copy, for instance,
[02:19] we've actually set up really good infrastructure
[02:21] for copy testing.
[02:22] And I'm of the opinion that companies should run
[02:25] as long as you have the user base to do it,
[02:26] like copy test constantly.
[02:28] Like the amount of copy tests that we've had
[02:30] that is just like that have won and you,
[02:32] I don't know, you just try things
[02:34] and you figure out what wins is definitely legion.
[02:37] And if ship like massive weds from little copy changes.
[02:40] Is there an example of that or just like the impact?
[02:42] Going back to that goal screen,
[02:44] we used to say continue are like standard CTAs continue.
[02:48] And we changed that to commit to my goal.
[02:51] And it was like a massive one.
[02:53] Even just, you know, and again, it was like, okay,
[02:56] users tapping on that.
[02:57] What are we asking them to do commit to the goal?
[02:59] What is that going to lead them to do commit?
[03:01] Not, you know, churn, just that little copy change
[03:04] that one time right there led to huge wins.
[03:07] And in copy changes are so cheap.
[03:10] Like it's just your translator, you know, for us,
[03:13] you know, we have a lot of, you know,
[03:14] users all over the world on the UI languages.
[03:16] So, but like just come up with a bunch of ideas,
[03:18] translate some strings.
[03:19] This is one where, you know,
[03:21] that the feedback that you'll typically get from Louisa.
[03:23] So all of our changes at Duolingo
[03:25] go through product review that, you know, are reviewed by Louisa.
[03:27] Louisa reviews every single change that, you know,
[03:30] we propose or every experiment that we run.
[03:34] To believe with copy, he's just like, I don't know, test it.
[03:37] Like there's nothing better than to be told by Louisa.
[03:40] I don't think this is going to win,
[03:41] but sure, if you want to.
[03:43] And a lot of times, you know,
[03:44] today's credit, he's right.
[03:45] And a lot of times, you know,
[03:47] our intuition was right,
[03:48] but it's just so cheap to do it.
[03:50] I think when the lift is smaller,
[03:53] it's great to have hypothesis,
[03:55] but you know, you don't need to beat it up too much.
