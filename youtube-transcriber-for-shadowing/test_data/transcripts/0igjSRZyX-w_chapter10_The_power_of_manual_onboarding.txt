============================================================

[00:00] The next area I want to spend time on and I imagine we'll have much insight is some
[00:06] of the contrarian ways you approach building superhuman that a lot of companies never thought
[00:12] about doing that you did that worked out for you.
[00:14] So the first is manually onboarding every single new user.
[00:20] Sure startups have done this like, you know, founders bring on some folks and then like
[00:23] cool show it show it to them and then they stop doing that and then it's like self service
[00:27] or sales teams.
[00:29] How far did you scale this manual onboarding phase of your of your company?
[00:36] Like how many people did you have onboarding people?
[00:37] How many people did you man any on board?
[00:40] Yeah, so for folks that don't know in those early days, we insisted on one to one concierge
[00:45] onboarding and it was absolutely the right thing to do.
[00:48] You couldn't use superhuman unless you went through the onboarding experience.
[00:52] And now it's almost the reverse almost every new superhuman customer goes through self
[00:56] service.
[00:57] The onboarding experience is still there.
[00:59] But again, it is absolutely the right thing to do.
[01:02] To answer your question at peak, we had about 20 people doing manual onboarding.
[01:08] OK, so it's not that many people.
[01:09] That's really interesting because I always imagine it was like a massive team, but 20
[01:14] people can do can handle a lot is the takeaway there.
[01:17] What was the scale, I guess, where you stopped manual onboarding just for folks that are
[01:21] like thinking about doing this and then went to stop.
[01:23] So I think the reason to stop is that there will always be certain personality types who
[01:28] do not want to go through a one on one onboarding.
[01:31] And at a certain point, those people will become very important and you will need to
[01:35] be ready with a world class self service option.
[01:39] When we started building self service, it seemed nearly impossible.
[01:44] In fact, it was terrifying because.
[01:48] It's difficult to overstate how much the entire DNA of the company was built around
[01:56] this idea that we would.
[02:00] Onboard users manually.
[02:03] And after all, we did so much in our one to one onboardings and there's only so much
[02:07] that software can do that we did after a lot of grind and persistence eventually figure
[02:11] it out and we have a world class self service experience today, but we did not at the time.
[02:17] So the flip side is why would you even do this to begin with?
[02:21] Well, we found two things.
[02:23] Number one, the user metrics are excellent for things like engagement, retention, product
[02:28] market, Fittscore, MPS, Boralicy.
[02:30] For all of those metrics, I think you will significantly beat your industry benchmarks
[02:35] if you go to the effort of one on one onboarding your early customers and it becomes so powerful
[02:42] to have that early cohort of super fans when it comes to things like building a brand.
[02:48] And if folks remember that conversation from way up at the top, what is it that creates
[02:52] true virality?
[02:53] It's not viral mechanics.
[02:56] It's word of mouth.
[02:57] It is brand.
[02:58] This is how you can kickstart a brand.
[03:00] And number two, in a world where you can easily and quickly raise funding, like for example,
[03:05] the zero interest rate phenomenon era, you can actually use dollars to avoid building
[03:10] a first time user experience and all of the normal growth loops that you would then have
[03:14] to build.
[03:15] You would then instead focus all of your engineers on finding product market fit or in solution
[03:20] deepening or in market widening.
[03:23] But not for example, on a first time user experience.
[03:28] Not for example, on activation because you have humans doing activation for you.
[03:33] And by contrast, I saw other companies often competing spend almost half their engineering
[03:37] dollars on those things.
[03:40] Uh, and probably cornering Naam and their
[03:46] marketing management forces bomb
[03:58] S Vanguard.
[03:59] AI companies have that again today. So if you can weave this into your strategy, I think
[04:04] you should, but you should also know when to stop.
[04:08] Super interesting. So I guess some factors to think about, because I wanted to ask you,
[04:12] when should people consider doing this if they're hearing this and like, this is awesome.
[04:16] So many problems solved if I just have somebody onboarding every new user, everyone's activated.
[04:20] Amazing. So some of the variables you're sharing is, do you have like cheap cash to invest in,
[04:26] say like it doesn't have to be 20 people, it could be a few people to start. And then if there's
[04:32] like an LTV kind of ACV element of just like, are you going to make enough for a new customer?
[04:37] Imagine that's a variable. Is there anything else you think founders should think about?
[04:42] Absolutely. You don't want to lose money doing this. And we always made money doing onboarding
[04:46] to be clear. It's just that at a certain point that the mass market, whether it for us as enterprise
[04:53] or all of the prosumers in the world, you hit a top of funnel with it needs to be wide enough
[05:01] where manually onboarding no longer makes sense.
