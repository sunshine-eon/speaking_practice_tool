============================================================

So just to summarize so far, if no metrics, you have no experiments, you have essentially no PMs, just one product leader. You spend a lot of time on design and craft and making things awesome. I'm curious just what you think it takes to make a company work in that way because this is pretty different from how a lot of other founders think and a lot of other product teams work.

We like to talk about this internally, this mixture of magic and science and how we describe this. There's always some level of science that we do, and I think some companies are very scientific on their product management; they like to measure everything and they do a lot of tests and things. But we just decided we don't think that's necessary or that's good for us.

So the science for us means that we do talk to users a lot. The whole project we start with involves some level of user research, and as founders, different people on the team might have weekly calls with customers or users. We also encourage everyone on the team to go to the customer Slack, where they can answer people's questions. We have shared Slack channels with customers, and I sometimes go in to answer questions there. I also see when they complain about something.

I think the first part is that the whole team has to really understand the product and the customers, as well as the problems people are facing. They need to have that empathy, along with an understanding of what the state of things is today. We talk about that, and sometimes we might pull up stats to see if there are any patterns, like, "Oh, I wonder if these kinds of companies are using this thing more. What do we think about it?" Usually, we have some kind of question we want to answer, rather than just pulling metrics to decide that we should increase a certain metric.

The magic part is what happens when you build this understanding. When everyone in the company builds a better understanding of the customer and product, we can have discussions about what we should be doing or what decisions we want to make. Everyone is much more informed about the actual reality of the customers or the product, and then we think you can rely more on intuition or thinking to make those decisions without needing data or metrics to back them up.

So, I think the main thing is that the whole company has to be engaged with the customers, to talk to them, and to understand where the product might work well or where it might not.
