============================================================

[00:00] Okay. I'm going to try to bring us back on course. The other thing you mentioned that
[00:04] I think is really interesting is hiring a president. A lot of founders and leaders might
[00:08] be hearing this and be like, going from eight reports and doing all these things I don't
[00:11] want to spending most of my time on the product and design and marketing. Amazing. What did
[00:16] this president take off your plate and what is their responsibility and that allowed you
[00:21] to do the stuff you wanted to do?
[00:23] The biggest thing was taking off the operations and the management of the executive team and
[00:31] the rest of the company. So think of the president role in superhuman as an operationally
[00:38] extremely challenging and very growthful role. Like it is, it's perfect for someone who wants
[00:43] to go on to be a CEO in their next role. And instead of hiring and firing that team, instead
[00:52] of managing and setting their goals, instead of the accountability conversations, someone
[00:58] else is now doing that. In addition, because that's not the only job, in addition, they're
[01:03] also a very strong thought partner when it comes to corporate strategy, when it comes
[01:10] to where do we take Act One, our email product, how far do we go down the multiplier path?
[01:18] How aggressively should we lean into AI? What's a reasonable gross margin in a world with
[01:24] AI? Are we from a financial perspective, okay, dipping now and then coming back later? When
[01:30] should we start building our second product? How do we think about our R&D strategy? Should
[01:35] we keep on hiring in the Bay Area or as we've done for many of our recent hires, should we
[01:39] continue hiring in Latin America? Should we consider other time zones as well? And so
[01:46] on and so on and so on. I mean, I'm just randomly coming up with questions, but the
[01:49] list is truly endless. It is another way to think about it is it's like a, it's almost
[01:56] like a grown up co-founder. The two people I co-founded the company with, Comrade and
[02:01] Vivek, they've long since gone from superhuman. We're now a 10-year-old organization and I'm
[02:05] one of those rare founders that is persisting and thriving actually 10 years in. That said,
[02:12] the journey never gets easier. It gets different and you still need that co-founding energy
[02:18] around you. And I have a handful of people in the organization who are in their roles
[02:24] providing that kind of energy, that kind of inputs and who thrive off doing so. And the
[02:29] president role is definitely one of them.
[02:31] Incredibly interesting. There's so many, so much there. One, just a couple of things I'll
[02:37] share and then I want to move on to a different topic. One is just, it's cool, the solution
[02:41] to helping you move faster and do the work you want to do is org design. That feels like
[02:47] a really doable thing. If you're finding you're not spending time on things you want to spend
[02:53] on time on and things aren't moving as fast as you want, it's essentially you can find
[02:57] people to take on things that you don't want and shift the way that the org is structured
[03:02] and that could solve a lot of problems. That's what it did for you. And then I think it's
[03:05] also really interesting. There's this lesson here of as a founder, if you're just feeling
[03:09] like, I don't know, depleted or just like not, don't have the partner you want, you could bring
[03:13] someone on. That could be that person.
[03:15] Absolutely.
[03:16] Yeah.
[03:17] Okay. There's so much there. That was much more of a rich area than I even expected.
