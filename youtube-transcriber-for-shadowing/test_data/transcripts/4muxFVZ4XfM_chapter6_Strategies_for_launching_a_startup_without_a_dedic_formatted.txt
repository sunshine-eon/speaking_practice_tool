============================================================

Another question along this line, because there's a lot of PMs listening, and they're going to be like, "Oh shit, these guys don't need PMs," or "PMs are over, product management is dead." So just another question along these lines: somebody needs to do the work that a PM does, basically, right? There are all these things on the plate of a product manager when they're at a company. If they're not there, other people have to do those things. What I'm hearing is that you give those responsibilities to the engineer, designer, and maybe other functions within the team. Is that right?

Yeah. So I mean, definitely. I think what it means is there is definitely a trade-off. Sometimes when companies specialize roles a lot, it's because it's more efficient. If the engineer just spends 100% of their time coding something, then they're using their skill set to the max. But we think that in order to build quality things or build things in a certain way, it's actually better if people spend some time thinking about things and not just executing. 

So yes, for every project, there's a project lead. That lead can be an engineer or designer. It's not like a formal role, nor is it based on your level or title. It's more like an assignment where, okay, now you are responsible for getting the project started and working together with the team to figure it out. Then you communicate when changes happen or how the progress is going. It definitely means that engineers and designers also have to do these things, and they need to think about the scope and communicate effectively. It's a different way of doing things, and not everyone wants to do that, which is fine. But in our hiring, we try to find people who are interested in a broader scope than just their specific skill set.

Yeah, I think those last two points are really essential. One, people often don't want to do this work, and they are happy to offload it to a potential product manager. The fact that engineers have to do all these "boring PM things" like communicating timelines, keeping peer specs aligned, and ensuring timelines are met—running meetings—many people don't want to do that. However, in this case, people seem to really want to be doing that. 

The other point is that you need a really high-caliber team that's very product-minded. The hiring bar needs to be very, very high for engineers and designers to want to do all these things and be good at them. I think those are two necessary ingredients for this to work out.
