============================================================

[00:00] driver. You know, one of the earliest experiments we ran was going from you still only be able to
[00:04] have one streak freeze, and then we let you have either two or three. So we tested two different
[00:09] arms. It was again, another huge DAUN. This actually is funny. It was something that this is,
[00:15] again, kind of a callback to that growth model post from Jorge. It actually was really bad
[00:21] for Kerr because we were basically saying, hey, you can take a day off. You know,
[00:26] that's okay. But it was really good for, this is going to be like alphabet soup, IWAR,
[00:31] an active, weekly active user return rate. So basically, users who had taken a day off,
[00:36] we were getting them to come back more at higher rates. And so it made up for our losses
[00:40] and Kerr. But effectively, what this meant is that, you know, why two streak freezes work
[00:45] better than one was, I don't know, sometimes people just need a little more flexibility
[00:49] than one day. But one of the, again, the really interesting insight of this experiment was
[00:53] that three streak freezes was actually no better than two streak freezes. And there were
[00:57] two competing things here. And I think this is important if you're going to build a streak,
[01:01] you know, to figure out what your flexibility mechanic is. We are getting more users to return
[01:06] after longer times away to an intact, you know, to an intact streak. But if you start taking
[01:11] three days off from any habit, it's just going to be less likely that you return even four
[01:16] days later. And so we had these competing things where users might, more users might
[01:20] be returning to a streak. A lot of users were also just not coming back. We were training them to,
[01:24] you know, take more time off. So that flexibility, what's the right amount of, I mean, we've,
[01:30] again, this is another area we've run hundreds of experiments on, what is the right number of
[01:35] flexibility? What is the right amount of flexibility? And we, we are constantly
[01:39] surprised here, we don't, I still don't have the answer for at every point in your
[01:44] streak journey, how much flexibility you need. One thing that I can say with certainty though
[01:48] is give more flexibility when a user is starting their streak. Again, one of our biggest streak
[01:54] freeze experiment when I feel like I'm constantly saying this, one of our biggest wins, but they
[01:58] all were really, really big. One of our biggest streak freeze wins was when you start a new
[02:03] streak, we give you two streak freezes. And again, it's so funny to think back. It's like,
[02:07] how are we not doing this to begin with? But at the time, the streak freeze was kind of an
[02:10] overly gamified mechanic. You had to buy them with gems. That's our in-app currency,
[02:16] because we wanted the whole idea of this to feel like it was really something you earned,
[02:23] that there was a little bit of pain to getting that streak freeze. And so we tested though,
[02:28] what if we just give users when they start off their streak to streak freezes?
[02:32] And holy smokes to that win. It's sort of obvious now in retrospect, but
[02:37] if you have a one or a two or a three day streak, it's really easy just to let it die
[02:42] and restart. Again, you need to get to seven days, what we've seen in the data for it to
[02:46] really lock in. And so giving users more flexibility so it's harder to lose their
[02:51] streak initially. And then conversely, and this is what we keep learning,
[02:55] eventually once people get on long streaks, you kind of don't want to give them as much
[02:59] flexibility because there's a lot of times where, yeah, users don't add, I'm like this,
[03:06] I've got like a 400 day streak. Note that that is a lot less time than I've been at Duolingo.
[03:11] I have lost and restarted streaks a lot of times at my time at Duolingo. But you start getting a
[03:15] lot in streaks and you really care about this feature. You really care about your streak. And
[03:20] most people, as long as you're not like backpacking through, I don't know, the back country of
[03:26] Utah, you'll be in a place where you can get service. And so figuring out
[03:33] where is the user, who is the user that actually could use Duolingo and not conditioning
[03:38] them to start taking days off that they didn't otherwise need to do is important to figure out
[03:45] sort of where that line is for your future. This is fascinating.
