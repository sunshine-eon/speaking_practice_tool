============================================================

[00:00] bug backlog. We fix every bug once they're surfaced almost. So it's, it's, it's part of the production
[00:08] engineers job really just to fix those things. I think where we get to nuance is like user experience
[00:14] improvements. The metric there that I really look at is how many support tickets come in
[00:23] that were due to a customer being confused. So we track that. And if that number is
[00:30] slightly elevated, we're basically saying you can't ship any new features, you need to fix,
[00:33] you need to fix these things. And so yeah, there's just these types of controls, but
[00:38] basically trying to standardize across the teams. This is your percentage of operational
[00:42] burden. This is your CSAT. This is your NPS. And this is the number of customers that are
[00:46] confused. As long as you maintain those metrics, you do whatever you want. But
[00:50] the moment that these things are under the red, you can't ship new features and you need to revert
[00:54] back to me. Something funny that happened after our post on how ramp built's product came out.
[01:00] Someone on LinkedIn, a product manager posted half jokingly that her CEO came to her and every
[01:05] PM's CEO came to them after that.
