============================================================

[00:00] Awesome. What a cool peek at something coming out soon. Or maybe all by the time this comes out.
[00:06] And with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got a bunch of questions for you. Are you ready?
[00:12] Yeah, I'm ready.
[00:13] All right. Well, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?
[00:19] Time was way of building by Christopher Alexander. Like he is this like, he wasn't really an architect, but he I think thought in
[00:29] Berkeley. And I think he has this like interesting thoughts about like, building things. And I like, he focuses on buildings
[00:36] and towns and these kinds of spaces. But I think there's a lot of like things that are also interesting for
[00:41] building software. The other the other book that I like is like the Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance,
[00:47] because it's also like talks about the quality of things. And I think that's one of the main themes of the book. And like,
[00:55] that the thing is also that quality is so hard to define. It is like, if you actually like start thinking about it,
[01:02] it's like, how do you define it? It's it's like, it's kind of like, it's really hard to pin pin down.
[01:07] But it's all kind of like, when you try something or see it, then you kind of know if it's quality or not.
[01:12] What are some recent movies or TV shows they've really enjoyed?
[01:16] I think that then the movie is like, probably the John Wick 4. I think it's, it's, it's like, kind of feels like, I mean,
[01:23] obviously, it's like, there's no a story in that movie. But it's like, I think it's very true to its nature. So I like that
[01:30] fact. And then also, recently, I started watching the silo on Apple TV. And I think I kind of like it. It's like a good
[01:38] mystery. And then also, it's kind of reminds me of the Fallout game. So, so I kind of like it that way too.
[01:45] I actually read the silo books. And I was really excited for the show to come out. But we mentioned this on a previous
[01:50] podcast, the show is like so little to do with actual books, like the core ideas are the same. But there's all these
[01:55] stories that they're just making up on the show. So I kind of stopped watching because I was just, it's not what I was
[02:00] hoping for. But maybe I need to check the books later. And like, once I watch that show,
[02:06] definitely read the books. But there's three of them. And only the first one is actually good. The other one
[02:10] they're not actually pretty good. And I should not have read them because it just just went off the rails a
[02:14] little bit. Anyway, next question, what is a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates when you're
[02:20] interviewing them? I think usually I like to ask, like, what is what is the candidate most proud of and why, like
[02:26] what, like on their professional life or otherwise, like what they're most proud of and why. And then I think we can
[02:32] go deeper on that. But I think it's kind of like, gives you a little bit indication like what the person
[02:37] values and like how they think about things. And also, like, I think it's always nice that people can share
[02:42] something like they think they did really well, and we can spend time on it versus just like, asking
[02:48] something like more like negative things. What are some favorite products if you're usually discovered that you
[02:54] really, really like?
[02:58] Not sure if I discovered them recently, but like recently I've been in this home office, I've been
[03:02] installing some of this hue lights. And I really like them because like, throughout the day, I can like have more
[03:09] like kind of harsh lighting, because it's I'm in meetings or something. And then like in the evening, I can kind of
[03:15] like change the temperature, like I make it much more like red or orange or something. So it's just like, I
[03:21] think it's nice to like you can kind of transition to space is like, okay, now I'm working and now I'm
[03:25] like, doing something else and you can use the lights to kind of like indicate that.
[03:30] That is so cool. Do you like automate the schedule or you manually change the color?
[03:34] Yeah, I just manually change it. So I have like, like on my home app, I have like scenes that like, so there's the
[03:41] night scene and then there's the day scene like the morning scene. And so I just like, click that button and then
[03:47] then it turns, changes the lights.
[03:49] That is extremely cool. I'm going to try that myself. What is a favorite life motto that you like to
[03:57] repeat yourself or share with people, something you kind of come back to a lot?
[04:00] Go slow to go fast is I think for me, it's it's it's about that. Sometimes people have tendency to rushing to
[04:09] things and especially in, I think in startups, but other places too that you kind of have this like, I
[04:15] think urgency is important. But but then sometimes you you have like too much urgency and you are rushing
[04:21] things and what happens is that you, you rushed it and then now you need to come back to fix it. So I
[04:27] think sometimes we I like to think that like, you should take some time to actually like think about it
[04:32] and like, what are you going to do and then do it? Because then it's in the end, it's going to be faster
[04:36] that way than like going back and forth and fixing things.
[04:40] What is the most valuable lesson that your mom or your dad taught you?
[04:44] I think it's like respecting people and things. So I think it's, I mean, I think the people respect us is pretty
[04:50] obvious. But I think that I think with the things you have also, I think that you should take good care of them
[04:57] like when you when you use them, you should like, I don't know, clean them or put them away and then they like
[05:02] ready for the next time. So I think I like that though, like you rather than like you treating things
[05:07] like that they are trash or or kind of like not that valuable, you should kind of like treat things that
[05:13] they are, they are valuable.
[05:15] Final question. You were born in Finland. I think you grew up in Finland. What is a finished food that people should
[05:21] definitely try to get as soon as they can?
[05:24] One is like this salmon soup. And it might sound weird, like a fish soup, like maybe it's not going to be that
[05:32] interesting. But it is like, it's like a creamy soup with some like potatoes, carrots and other things.
[05:38] And it's kind of like almost like a sweet, little bit like sweet flavor to it. So that's one thing like you can
[05:45] you can make it yourself at home or or you can like, if you go to Finland, there's probably like a few restaurants
[05:50] that offer it.
[05:51] Okay, amazing. Is that something we could get here or you have to go to Finland to get it?
[05:55] I don't think I've never seen it here in in the US in any restaurant. But it's not very hard to make it
[06:00] yourself if you can really Google recipes. It's basically you just need some salmon and some some
[06:07] some like basic spices and some cream and and some fruit fetch the post.
[06:12] All right, next episode, we're going to do a cooking show with Kari. Kari, thank you so much for being here.
[06:18] You're building a very special company in a really unique way. And I think many founders and many product
[06:23] builders can learn a ton from watching you operate in the business that you're building.
[06:27] So again, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if
[06:31] they want to reach out, maybe ask you some more questions? And how can listeners be useful to you?
[06:36] Yeah, so I'm on Twitter. My name Kari Sarnen and and and we also have the linear account, which is I think
[06:43] is interesting. So that's at linear. And then yeah, I think like, I hope everyone can like check out
[06:50] check out linear and like see if it could work for them in their company and like figure out
[06:54] if there's a pilot, like I think we always happy to assist on those things that like if you
[06:59] just want to try it out and try it with the team, we can help you to set it up and and
[07:05] like help you to like understand how to use the product.
[07:08] Awesome. And it's just linear that app, right? Is that the URL?
[07:11] Yes.
