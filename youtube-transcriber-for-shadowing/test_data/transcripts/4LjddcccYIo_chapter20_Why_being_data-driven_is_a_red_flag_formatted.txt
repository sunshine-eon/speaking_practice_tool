============================================================

What is something that you believe about product management that maybe other people are less convinced by? The one I like to have in this area is that people who are really excited about being data-driven, to me, that is oftentimes a red flag for their product thinking. Especially if it's, you know, an executive who's saying things like, "Oh, we're so data-driven. We make all our decisions, you know, with our dashboards." 

To me, that says that the team is over-emphasizing quantitative data at the expense of qualitative data, and they're not using good judgment. They probably don't do a lot of direct user research. They don't really understand the humans who are using the thing, what they need, what they care about, and they're managing via a dashboard. Maybe if they got really, really good at picking metrics, it would be fine. Oftentimes, maybe it is fine. Maybe you have a high-volume business that's really easy to run experiments on, and that works for you. 

But for most PMs, most jobs, most products, you're going to be better off talking to ten users. You'll get more and better insights out of why things are happening than you would with any dashboard. So the takeaway there is just like, be careful when someone is saying they're super data-driven, our team is super data-driven, our company is super data-driven. Yeah, and maybe it's true, right? And that's great. I'm not saying that you don't need data. You absolutely do need to instrument your products and understand if it's working at scale, but you can't forget that you need to know why. 

It won't tell you why anything is happening. If you don't understand why it's happening, I don't think you can come up with good insights about what you should do next. Wait, one quick story on this. I remember really early on in my career, Adam Medros, who was the VP at Rata Detriburvisor, we were in a room. We just had this meeting called Product Review that was amazing when I first joined, and someone was justifying this project. 

He just, and I hope he is okay with me saying this because this is my memory of this moment, he was just like, "This is an obviously better thing. Like just do it. Stop doing all the stuff that you're doing. Stop with these numbers." Whatever it was they were doing, he said, "If it's obviously better, if it's logically better, use your good judgment to do that thing and let's move on." 

I've always thought about that. You can just do the obviously better thing. Yeah, I love that. I pull that card sometimes, but I think you almost have to do it that way. Just like, "Okay, everyone. This one's just obviously a good idea. Let's just do it." Yes. Enough research.
