Video: How Revolut trains world-class PMs: The “Local CEO” model, raw intellect & building wow products
Time: 00:00 - 03:41
============================================================

[00:00] Everyone is striving for talented, skillful, smart people.
[00:04] Revolute values way more raw intellect and this unquenched hunger to build things rather than experience.
[00:12] I hear one of the ways you approach early products differently is you guys invest a lot in actually making it good.
[00:18] It's not getting traction.
[00:19] Is it because the underlying idea is wrong or maybe your product just sucks?
[00:24] By forcing everyone to build a product that people will love.
[00:29] We kind of cut out this part of uncertainty.
[00:32] We can cut down the product in terms of functionality to just most critical features,
[00:38] but we will never compromise on the quality and UX and aesthetics.
[00:42] Is there anything that you figured out about just how to set up new products for success?
[00:47] If something is 99% done, it's closer to 0% rather than 100%.
[00:53] Today my guest is Dmitri Slakazov.
[00:56] Dmitri is global head of product at Revolute,
[00:59] which is a finance supra offering customer savings and checking accounts,
[01:03] crypto, investing, joint accounts, even mortgages.
[01:06] Not only was it last valued at over $60 billion,
[01:10] but in the research that I've been doing to which companies hire and incubate the best product managers,
[01:14] Revolute was right at the top alongside Palantir and Intercom.
[01:19] And so in our conversation, we dig into what Revolute has learned about producing and hiring great product leaders,
[01:25] including a focus on ownership, having people solve really painful and complex problems,
[01:30] while making the experience wow and lovable by users,
[01:34] also indexing towards hiring really smart and driven people early in their career,
[01:38] versus people with a ton of experience in the space.
[01:40] And so much more if you're looking for a job that will accelerate your product career,
[01:45] or want to help your product team level up.

[02:08] This entire episode is brought to you by Stripe.
[02:11] There's a reason that I've had more guests on this podcast from Stripe than any other company.
[02:16] It's because they hire the best people and they build incredible products.
[02:20] You probably know them for their payments platform, which powers my newsletter,
[02:24] and also companies like NVIDIA and Salesforce and Zoom and DoorDash.
[02:29] What you may not know is that they have several other products that can help accelerate your revenue,
[02:33] such as Stripe billing, which powers billing for companies that you may have heard of,
[02:38] OpenAI, Anthropic, Figma, Atlassian, and over 300,000 other companies.
[02:45] Stripe billing lets you bill and manage customers however you want,
[02:48] from simple recurring billing to usage-based billing to sales-negotiated contracts.
[02:53] There's also Stripe's Optimized Checkout Suite, which is a plug-and-play,
[02:57] super-optimized payment flow that natively supports over 100 global dynamic payment methods.
[03:03] There's also a product called LINK, which is an accelerated checkout experience built
[03:07] specifically to increase your checkout conversion.
[03:10] Every single one of the Forbes top 50 AI companies that have a product in the market today
[03:15] use Stripe to monetize it.
[03:17] Half of Fortune 100 companies use Stripe.
[03:21] $1.4 trillion flows through Stripe annually, which is equivalent to over 1% of global GDP.
[03:27] Use Stripe to handle all of your payment-related needs,
[03:30] billing, manage revenue operations, and launch or invent new business models.
