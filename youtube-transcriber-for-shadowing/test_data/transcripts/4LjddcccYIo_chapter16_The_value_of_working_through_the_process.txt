[00:00] Awesome. This reminds me a little bit of, I just, I keep mentioning this chat with Bill
[00:04] Carr that I had who was an early Amazon exec and how the narrative approach at Amazon,
[00:10] one of the benefits of that and the reasons they go there is probably for you to realize
[00:14] this is a bad idea before anyone even needs to give you feedback and that's why they
[00:18] forced you to write six pages in depth about your idea. And then it goes in these concentric
[00:23] circles through the company and ideas like, here's, okay, and this is just not
[00:26] a good idea. Here's all the reasons why. So I think there's a lot of similarities there.
[00:31] Yeah, I, there are many, many times when, if you combine this, this artifact and process with
[00:39] the point about simplification, where through that process, you just start cutting so many
[00:44] things. Because then what happens is, let's say you've gone through this exercise and
[00:48] you're like, okay, I know exactly what my three things are that I want to work on.
[00:53] Then you, there's a moment where you take the strategy and then you look at your roadmap.
[00:58] And they're never the same. And the roadmap is just bloated with all of this random stuff that
[01:04] like, oh, well, we have to do that because of this or we have to do that because of that.
[01:07] This thing we're still working on, this is like six months away, it's we're still going to do
[01:10] the thing. And then all of a sudden you've got 90% of your resources committed to things
[01:16] that don't track against your strategy. And it's a really interesting moment as a leader,
[01:19] especially to sit there and go, well, what do we do? Like what do you do when you, when you
[01:25] have that problem? And, and especially if you're a PM, you probably don't have the agency to say
[01:29] scrap the entire roadmap and work on my new strategy. But at least it allows you to think
[01:33] about critically about whether you should be doing what you're doing and allows you to
[01:37] evaluate whether those things are still the most important things to work on.
