Video: Behind the product: Duolingo streaks | Jackson Shuttleworth (Group PM, Retention Team)
Time: 00:00 - 06:00
============================================================

[00:00] Duolingo is a $14 billion company that's hitting all-time highs, too.
[00:03] It just keeps going up.
[00:03] I think it doubled in value in the past six months.
[00:06] Streaks is the most impactful feature.
[00:08] We have right now over 9 million users with a year-plus streak.
[00:13] If you look at the numbers, I think has been our biggest growth lover.
[00:16] What Duolingo really focuses on is, you know, how do we help users build
[00:19] habits around language learning?
[00:22] Getting user come back the next day is the biggest problem to solve.
[00:24] Let's get into the mother load of learnings from the journey of Streaks.
[00:27] Talk about the key lessons, insights, and also wrong turns along the way.
[00:30] I'd say, like, test everything.
[00:32] We've run in the last four years over 600 experiments on the street.
[00:36] So every other day, we've actually set up really good infrastructure for copy testing.
[00:41] We used to say continue, our, like, standard CTAs continue.
[00:44] And we changed that to commit to my goal, and it was, like, a massive win.
[00:48] There's so much human psychology that you all learn through all these experiments
[00:52] of just, like, how to motivate people, what motivates, what demotivates.
[00:55] Say that you played a mobile game, that you've done it for 3,000 days in a row.
[00:59] I don't know.
[01:00] Maybe that hits a little bit different than you've learned Spanish for 3,000 days in a row.
[01:07] Today, my guest is Jackson Shettleworth.
[01:10] Jackson is a group product manager at Duolingo, leading the retention team.
[01:14] This is a different kind of episode that I'm experimenting with,
[01:18] where we spent the entire conversation focused on the journey and lessons of a single feature.
[01:24] In this case, Duolingo Streaks.
[01:26] Duolingo is a $14 billion business.
[01:30] Just over the past six months, they doubled in value.
[01:32] They're hitting all-time highs in usage and market cap.
[01:36] They're also one of the very few successful and also the single biggest consumer app business in the world.
[01:42] And as you'll hear from Jackson, the Streaks feature is the single most impactful feature
[01:47] that most contributed to this growth and success.
[01:50] In other words, you could argue this one feature created billions of dollars of value,
[01:55] which to me means it is worth studying in depth.
[01:59] In our conversation, Jackson shares the history of the Streaks feature,
[02:02] all of the biggest wins and wrong turns they've taken along the way,
[02:05] what he and his team have learned about what works and doesn't work with a Streaks mechanic,
[02:10] and also how they set up their teams to operate in a way that allows them to run over 600 experiments on this product
[02:16] and continue to find big wins.
[02:18] I hope to do more episodes like this on features and products that you'd love to hear more about,

[02:44] Jackson, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.
[02:48] Yeah, thank you. Long time listener, first-time caller.
[02:50] I appreciate it.
[02:53] So this is going to be a really interesting conversation.
[02:56] I've never done an episode like this before where we basically spent like an hour and a half going into one feature of one product.
[03:05] But this is a very special feature.
[03:07] It's a very special product.
[03:09] Have you ever spent like an hour and a half just talking about this one feature with anyone?
[03:13] Well, internally, so when we onboard new folks to the team, I actually just did this with somebody that joined the team recently where we spent,
[03:21] and I was like, hey, let's spend an hour just talking about the streak.
[03:24] We got through an hour, and I got through about 30% of what I wanted to share.
[03:29] There's just so much.
[03:30] We'll talk about this, but there's so much that we've learned over the years.
[03:33] But never anything externally like this.
[03:35] I think we've shared bits and pieces of learnings, but this will be like the mother load of learnings, hopefully, of how Dueling goes both the street.
[03:42] We should title this the mother load of learnings of Dueling of Streaks.
