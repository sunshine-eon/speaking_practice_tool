============================================================

[00:00] speed of engineering and the engineering team.
[00:02] And they find that quality goes up
[00:04] as your product velocity goes up.
[00:07] You think it'd be the opposite.
[00:08] The faster you move, the lower quality ends up being.
[00:12] But exactly to your point,
[00:13] because you can fix things really quickly
[00:15] and you can get things out the door
[00:16] and there's not this like huge chunk
[00:18] you have to wait for people to review
[00:20] and release and break things ends up being higher quality.
[00:23] So very much aligned with their experience.
[00:26] Yeah, and you have to create a system
[00:28] by which those folks are getting that feedback, right?
[00:30] And so we really focused on what are the control mechanisms
[00:36] that ensure that your high velocity
[00:38] doesn't tank the business.
[00:40] And so examples of that is we have a voice
[00:43] of customer processes where every single negative review
[00:48] that is shared on to our products
[00:51] is shared back to the tech lead,
[00:53] the PM and the designer on a monthly basis.
[00:57] We report back NPS and CSAP.
[00:59] We report back operational overhead,
[01:02] meaning the percentage of tickets
[01:04] that come from your product area
[01:06] normalized by the number of users
[01:08] that are using that product.
[01:09] And that's a core contract that the team has
[01:13] to maintain a lower part of operational burden.
[01:17] We also have bugs and issues
[01:20] being directly assigned to the engineer that's on call.
[01:24] So they feel that pain
[01:26] and then they can continue to your point,
[01:29] leveraging velocity to solve those problems.
[01:31] Velocity is just a magnitude.
[01:33] It's not necessarily a specific direction.
[01:36] With these bugs that are coming in
[01:37] in quality issues versus a team's goal
[01:41] and their KPIs that they're trying to hit,
[01:43] how do you recommend teams balance those two things?
[01:47] We don't have a...
