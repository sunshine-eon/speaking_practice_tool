Time: 52:10 - 58:43
============================================================

[00:00] Okay, let me take this opportunity to try to summarize what I've learned from you so far in terms of what you guys have figured out about creating incredible product leaders that go on to do wonderful things.
[00:10] And basically one of the top three most successful companies at this. So there's kind of these two buckets as I talked to you and the Palantir guy.
[00:19] There's kind of like the hiring piece and then there's that what you do to help incubate this kind of forge for incredible product leaders.
[00:25] So in the what you do internally, kind of the four bullet points I've got here is give people a lot of ownership. There are essentially GM's of the product, the future.
[00:36] There's a lot of focus on depth and complexity and getting really good at solving really gnarly problems.
[00:42] And then there's building a focus on building Wow products amazing lovable products that are very that have a very high bar.
[00:49] And then there's kind of like a subtle point that I think is probably impactful here is just working closely with detail obsessed founders or product leaders like you and learning from you all and just like seeing the value and impact of being super detail oriented.
[01:05] On that bucket. Is there anything else you think is super core that I missed before we get to hiring?
[01:11] Yeah, I would just maybe highlight the aspect of this like going deep into details. Right. It's it's there are two main streams. First is let's say being technical understanding how underlying systems work. But second is also, you know, building empathy towards customers understand the possible context.
[01:31] And making sure that your product will satisfy each one of them.
[01:36] That's a great point. So it's like actually understanding the bare metal of what is happening and how it's possible and then making the experience as simple and Wowable as possible.
[01:45] There is also a third aspect. But it's a boring one. And it's it's like a compliant with all possible regulations and making sure that your product, you know, will satisfy the regulator. But it's also an important part of the job.
[02:03] Like what I get from that is just building patience.
[02:06] I would say I would say it's actually being able to to unblock your team. And that sometimes require product owners to steamroll changes.
[02:18] It also means that, you know, you could easily get stuck with a lot of people just looking into each other and thinking, okay, can they approve it? Can they not approve it? We try to innovate on it. We try to automate as many things as possible. We use even AI models for that. But
[02:36] It also requires a product owner to be able to to get things done, you know, just just getting people down to to consensus and understanding who you stakeholders, how to get them to the necessary decision and then blocking your team so that eventually, like the value is shipped to to customers.
[03:00] Awesome. So essentially, it's just getting shit done, plowing through blockers, dealing with many stakeholders.
[03:07] Yeah, that's always the most important.
[03:10] Okay, that that's a great addition. I could see why that would be really helpful for folks that are trying to get ahead in their career. Okay. And then on the hiring piece, which you look for is raw intellect, drive hunger, passion, essentially, those are the first two. And then interestingly, non senior non, not people with a ton of experience in the problem space, more
[03:30] so focusing on intellect and hunger. Is there anything else in that bucket that you think is important that leads to people being really successful?
[03:38] Most importantly, it's again, getting things done, getting your hands dirty. And, you know, like, great product owners are very hands on. They don't think of themselves as
[03:52] managers who just give tasks to people and wait them to complete it. They just go and get things done. And they understand that most important things, they will likely have to do themselves. And they understand that there needs to be relentless focus on execution. And if something is 99% done, it's closer to 0% rather than 100%.
[04:18] Wow. Say more there is the kind of insight there is just like things seem like they're 99% done, but they're actually very far from being done.
[04:26] Like, sometimes the product is built. But then product owners are the ones who also, you know, make sure that, for example, customer care team or sales and marketing team are using it to a full extent. Because without it, it could be just another useless feature which no, and no one knows about it.
[04:46] That is super cool. I like the mentality.
[04:49] Let me ask you something completely different. What's kind of the story of you landing at Revolut? I know you had to move your family and was a whole adventure.
[04:57] My journey into Revolut actually coincided with me moving to the UK. So it was a completely new environment for myself. It's a huge stress load for the brain as well.
[05:13] And it's not only about, you know, using the other side of the lane on the road in the UK, but also it's a lot of things, for example, in the industry, like some concepts that I've never heard about.
[05:28] Actually, I've never worked at FinTech before. So I also changed the industry. So it was like a complete turnaround for me and for my career.
[05:41] But I was very determined and excited about it because everyone who I've been talking to, they were saying Revolut is like top talent.
[05:51] He's a travel look like all best product people and I travel it. And I really wanted to be part of this great team.
[06:00] Eventually, it actually appeared to be advantageous for me because I also had this fresh view on things.
[06:08] And even in the Revolut app, which is actually way, way better than other banks products, right?
[06:17] But even there, I found some things that for me, because of this lack of context, they were not intuitive.
[06:24] And I worked hard with the team to change that.
