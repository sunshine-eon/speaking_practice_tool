So then the pandemic occurs. I had this image in my mind; it was like a dream where I could run a company much more like a startup. I remember going on a walk with Joe, Nate, and Balinas in October 2019. During that walk, I shared my dream of leaving the company ten years ago, only to be asked to come back. I expressed my horror at what I found upon my return. 

They asked me, "What did you find?" I replied that I discovered a company with an amazing culture and people, a great mission, and a brand that people really loved. However, we had lost our design roots. We weren't investing in the long term; instead, we were obsessing over hitting metrics. There was no cohesive understanding of what we were doing, making it really hard to get work done. Many of our great people were leaving, costs were rising, and growth was slowing. That was exactly what was happening. 

Then the pandemic hit, and we lost 80% of our business in just eight weeks. Suddenly, we were faced with a crisis. I remember staring into the abyss, and while I've never had a near-death experience, it's been described to me as a moment where your life flashes before your eyes, and you gain clarity. That’s what happened to our business; we had a near-death experience, and everything flashed before our eyes. 

In that moment, I knew I had to take action. I decided to run the company differently, to get back into all of the essential elements that had been neglected.
