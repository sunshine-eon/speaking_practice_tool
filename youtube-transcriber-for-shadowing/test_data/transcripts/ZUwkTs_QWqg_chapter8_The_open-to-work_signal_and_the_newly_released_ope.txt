============================================================

[20:22] where people wanna go look for jobs and make hires.
[20:25] What I was thinking about as you were just chatting
[20:27] is this open to work feature that LinkedIn has
[20:30] and how, I remember days before that existed
[20:33] and there's people used to just like, Jerry Rigg,
[20:35] hey, I'm hiring or I'm looking for a job.
[20:37] And there's always the sense that if you're open to work,
[20:39] you're not as good.
[20:40] Cause why would you be amazing and open to work and not hired?
[20:44] And I'm curious if you were even part of this experience,
[20:47] just like, what was it like to come up with that approach
[20:49] to how to communicate that you're open to work?
[20:51] It's been through phases.
[20:52] And I think those phases really reflect on
[20:55] kind of perception of how it's changed.
[20:56] I mean, in the beginning it was, you could say
[20:58] you're open to work, but it was a secret signal
[21:00] to recruiters, if you will.
[21:01] That certainly still exists, but now we said
[21:03] you could more publicly say it,
[21:05] and maybe it'd be a feed post.
[21:06] And then we kind of started launching it
[21:08] actually was around COVID when a lot of the stigmas
[21:10] of unemployment changed dramatically
[21:12] because everyone started understanding
[21:13] you're in this different situation.
[21:15] And we started putting the frame
[21:17] and that's kind of the more iconic way
[21:20] I think people are associated with now.
[21:22] It's funny, just this week we tried something new
[21:24] and I feel like it's almost the same journey.
[21:28] There are many customers as you imagine
[21:29] have LinkedIn learning and LinkedIn learning
[21:32] is typically an enterprise product.
[21:33] It works across your employee base.
[21:35] So we're trying to do open to internal work
[21:37] where you can say I'm actually at the point
[21:39] where I may want to next play internally in my role
[21:41] and an internal recruiter can see you.
[21:43] And as you can imagine, I would actually maybe argue
[21:45] more stigma about being concerned about
[21:47] setting your manager and certainly
[21:49] there's different cultures and companies about this.
[21:52] I have a feeling in, sometimes we like to think
[21:55] five, 10 years out, I think it's gonna go on the same journey.
[21:58] That's kind of one hunch I have that it'll also be
[22:00] an employment driven kind of way internally
[22:03] for people to find their next play.
[22:04] And it'll be interesting to see how it plays out,
[22:06] but already it's you can feel a little bit of that tension
[22:08] right when we launched it and kind of knowing
[22:10] I hope that let's see how this goes.
