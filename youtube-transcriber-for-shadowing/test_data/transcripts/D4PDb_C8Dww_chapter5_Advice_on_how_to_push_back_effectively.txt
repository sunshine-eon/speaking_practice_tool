============================================================

[00:00] Do you have any advice to data people to get better at pushing back?
[00:05] Sounds like a bit of like cultural, like we have time we need to work on these bigger things,
[00:08] but just any advice for data leaders or data ICs to find time for these sorts of things?
[00:14] Yeah, I mean, say no to someone is never fun. I think as a self-proclaimed people pleaser,
[00:22] you don't want to say no, especially when it's something you can do and you know that you
[00:25] can very easily with maybe an hour's work make someone happy. I think it's really important for
[00:31] to establish a culture and for leadership to really sort of establish the rules of working
[00:38] in that operating model so that some of the junior folks aren't forced to always have to say no.
[00:44] And I think one of the ways we do that is through our goaling. So because our goals are the same
[00:50] as our business partners, we're able to pretty easily say, hey, we've got a limited amount of time.
[00:55] These are our goals. What are the most important things that we are going to work on this week
[00:59] or this month in order for both of us to hit our goals? And so when something comes up to be
[01:05] able to say, hey, is this data poll that you want me to do, is this more important than
[01:13] these other three things that I was going to be working on? Yes or no? And I think when
[01:18] you sometimes people don't necessarily realize the trade-offs and when you make them apparent and you
[01:25] put them front and center, they realize that, oh, actually, you know what? That that's not
[01:30] important. That can wait. So I think that that's definitely something I would recommend, which
[01:34] is always share the trade-offs. Don't kind of suffer in silence with how am I going to do
[01:38] all four of these things. Bring it up and say, hey, this is what I was planning to do.
[01:43] If you want me to do this extra new thing, then one of these other things is going to have to drop.
[01:49] And I personally don't think that your ask is more important than these three things. But
[01:54] maybe there's new information. Maybe there's context I don't have. So let's talk about it.
[01:58] Rather than just being like, no, I won't do that. I don't think that's not a great approach
[02:03] either. I think having the conversation and constantly reevaluating your prioritization to
[02:08] make sure you're working on the most important things or your team is working on the most
[02:11] important things is really good hygiene to have with your business partner. So some teams
[02:16] do that through a weekly kind of stand-up of like, here's what we're going to do this week.
[02:21] Do we like this prioritization? Do we not? Some folks do it less formally than that. I think,
[02:26] you know, you've got to figure out what works for you. But to the earlier point, it's a
[02:31] conversation with your engineering partner, your product partner, your ops partner,
[02:36] you're all on the same team. You're all trying to achieve the same goals. And
[02:40] you're all incentivized to have your analytics team working on the most impactful things.
[02:46] This advice is great for any role, basically. And like if I were to summarize it to a couple
[02:52] words, it's just like prioritize and communicate what your priorities are. And then align on the
[02:58] trade-offs, though, shifting your priorities. Every once in a while, you just kind of throw
[03:02] one over and say, you know what, this is quick. I'll do it. At least I do. I think,
[03:06] you know, sometimes just knock it out, build some goodwill. I think that that's also important.
[03:11] But usually it's not something you can do in five minutes. And in that case, it's that
[03:17] ruthless prioritization, for sure. And then there's also the side that you talked about,
[03:21] of just show that you can provide value doing these things that are longer term,
[03:25] like prove your worth. Hey, look at all these opportunities I found for a team over time.
[03:29] Like I should keep spending time on these other areas versus on fire stuff.
