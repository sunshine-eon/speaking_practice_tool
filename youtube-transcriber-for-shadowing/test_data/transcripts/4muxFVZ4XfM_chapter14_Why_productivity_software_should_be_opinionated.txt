============================================================

[00:00] I think there is this ideas or notions in the world
[00:02] that flexible software is great.
[00:05] I'm like, I think it can be great sometimes,
[00:07] but what happens is people start spending a lot of time
[00:11] figuring things out, like how does this feature work?
[00:13] Like you can use it in 10 different ways
[00:15] and then every team or everyone figures out
[00:18] the different way of doing it.
[00:20] So our thinking is like we like to provide
[00:24] this like good defaults or good opinions,
[00:27] like this is how the feature works
[00:28] and this is how the workflow works.
[00:30] So you as a user or as a team don't have to think about it
[00:34] and you can focus on the work you do.
[00:37] And the other thing is like my design mantra
[00:39] is always like design something for someone.
[00:42] Like it's very hard to design everything for everyone
[00:45] because there's you just end up
[00:47] with a very generalized solution.
[00:50] So then what we're trying to do with the opinionated
[00:53] solution is that like that's the best solution
[00:55] or the most optimized solution we think of.
[00:58] And then like when you use it, like hopefully you agree
[01:01] and like you can feel that it's the most optimized.
[01:04] So being opinionated, it's like, I think the value
[01:07] it provides people is like you don't have to think too much
[01:10] like or spend some more time on the tool
[01:14] than you do on your actual work.
