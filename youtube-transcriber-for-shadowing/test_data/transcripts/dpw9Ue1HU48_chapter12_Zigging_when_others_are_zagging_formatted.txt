============================================================

Okay, so this theme has come up a bunch already in our conversation. I asked Chris Miller, a previous podcast guest, what you're amazing at and what I should talk to you about. He said that you're very good at zigging when other people are zagging and zagging when other people are zigging. I think that's already come across in our conversation. Is there anything else along those lines that you think might be helpful to people in terms of how you think about that or examples of that in action?

This comes down to kind of high conviction, low consensus bets. We had like three things that we were zigging, and by the way, it's not just me; my co-founder and I both have that kind of zig versus zag mindset. We ask ourselves this to this day: "Okay, we understand that this is the way because the world moves the way it's normally done, but have we considered this completely? I think we should do it, but have we considered this alternate path?" I would encourage you, at any state of the company, to not necessarily do the zig versus zag, but at least know what the zig would have been and talk it through.

Some of the best startup advice I've heard and ever given is that startups should focus on one thing and be really, really exceptionally world-class better than anyone else at that one thing. One of our early zigs was that we were going to do exactly the opposite of that. From year one, HubSpot decided to build an SEO tool, web analytics, blogging tool, and content management—all of it. In every one of those categories that we were building a product in, literally in year one, there were great products with great companies behind them. So, it's like, "Okay, why would you do that?"

The reason is that the one thing we wanted to be good at was solving for the actual customer problem that existed. The customer problem that existed was not a drift of tools; lots of great SEO and blogging tools already existed. But SMBs specifically did not have the wherewithal to put all those pieces together. You and I might think, "Oh, I can throw a website up, I can put Google Analytics on it, I can put a Woofoo or Typeform on it, I can do all these things, I can wire it all—no big deal." But for most people, most SMBs, that's a science project. 

So we said, "Okay, in order for us to solve the actual customer problem, we have to do it—even if it's uncomfortable, even though it's contrary to every kind of instinct and every piece of advice we've heard or given that says we should not do this." Once you make that decision, you have to consider the implications. 

We said this in the early years: if you take this all-in-one approach and have a broad-based product, you might end up being "many miles wide and only so inches deep." One of our systematic thinking approaches was to measure each of those individual product categories that we were now playing in. Are we in the top three in the market in that category? If the answer is yes, that means we invested too much in that category. We should not be in the top three because our value proposition is not that we want to be the top three blogging tools or the top three web analytics tools. Our value proposition is that everything works so well together.

Being in the top three and having the right features doesn't matter as much as the all-in-one approach. That means we over-indexed on one individual category, and that was one of our heuristics for being able to tell that we were over-indexed on one particular aspect of it. It is hilarious; rarely do I hear someone say, "We're in the top three, and we're doing the wrong thing." We were, by the way, and we changed that over time. In the startup world, I would argue that most of the categories we play in now show that we're, as surveys tell you, in the top three in each of those categories. But at the time, when we were very resource constrained, we were trying to be disciplined and focused.
