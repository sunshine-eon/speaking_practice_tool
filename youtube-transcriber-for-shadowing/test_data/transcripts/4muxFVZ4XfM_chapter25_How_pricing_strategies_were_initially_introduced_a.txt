============================================================

[00:00] There's so many interesting lessons from this.
[00:03] I wanted to ask how you got your first 10 customers,
[00:06] and what I'm hearing essentially was from this waitlist.
[00:09] You launched it on Twitter, people signed up,
[00:10] you picked people to let on board.
[00:13] You worked with them over the course of a year to make
[00:15] it what they needed and then eventually started charging.
[00:18] Yeah. I think the first 10 companies using it,
[00:22] I think maybe a little over a half.
[00:25] Maybe there was three friends that have
[00:29] startups and they used it and then I think the majority of
[00:32] them were just from this waitlist,
[00:33] but they didn't like pay us anything.
[00:36] We didn't have pricing in the beginning or doing
[00:39] the private beta. At some point,
[00:41] we start building the payments function,
[00:42] so we just added a page in the settings that you can
[00:47] optionally pay and then we just give you
[00:49] a slider that how much do you want to pay per seat.
[00:53] Then we just see if some people
[00:57] paid like $28 per seat and some people paid like $1.
[01:00] But it doesn't really matter,
[01:04] we just wanted to test the functionality and see what people think.
[01:08] Then after a year, when we launched,
[01:11] we already had the first week of launching,
[01:15] we have probably some hundreds of customers.
[01:18] I've never heard of the approach to pricing as
[01:20] just an actual sliding scale where people can slide
[01:24] the scale themselves and how much they want to pay.
[01:26] Did that help you figure out what to charge or is it mostly just an experiment?
[01:30] I don't think it gave us enough data to decide.
[01:34] But I think it was good to see that there was some people that went.
[01:39] I think that 20 was probably the maximum that people could pay,
[01:43] so I think there were some people that went to it and they felt like,
[01:46] actually, I really love the products,
[01:48] I'm happy to pay like $28.
[01:49] I think at least it gave us some confidence that if we charge for this and it's
[01:55] something under $20, there's going to be market.
