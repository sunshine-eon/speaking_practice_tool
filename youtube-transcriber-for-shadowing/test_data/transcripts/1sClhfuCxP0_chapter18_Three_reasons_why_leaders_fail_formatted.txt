============================================================

There are only three reasons why things do not happen the way you want them to happen as a leader. You can look at a person and identify one of three issues: either that person can't do something, which indicates a capability issue; they won't do it, pointing to a motivation or alignment issue; or they were not set up to do it, which is really your problem as a leader. This means you didn't establish the right ways of working, organizational design, or OKR structure for success.

As a leader, it's almost the opposite of what we discussed regarding great influence and raw shops. You need to assess whether you have the right people in terms of capability. If not, the right answer might be to coach them, mentor them, or perhaps move them to a different role where their capabilities are better suited. If they won't do something, you need to dig deeper into the reasons why. Are they not aligned with you? Do they disagree with your vision? Do they not have enough time? Understanding these motivations is crucial.

Moreover, if it's a setup issue, I've realized that apart from what product managers can do, almost 70 to 80 percent of the problems regarding why things don't happen stem from setup issues. Product leaders or other leaders often haven't fully considered what OKRs are doing to their company or haven't thought through the organizational design. If you've read the book "Team Topologies," it starts with Conway's Law, which states that you can infer the organizational design of a company from its engineering architecture. This principle also manifests in products; you can often look at a product and deduce the organizational design that led to its creation.

I've heard that book mentioned a couple of times recently, and I need to check it out. Regarding the three issues I just shared, I love the framework: can do, won't do, and the third one—didn't do, or not set up to do. The last one is quite significant and complex. What's interesting about these categories is that they serve as ways to measure performance. For instance, in performance reviews for product managers, you can assess whether they had the skills to do something, the motivation to do it, or if they simply weren't set up for success.
