============================================================

[00:00] And then just get other people find,
[00:03] there's probably somebody around you that's good
[00:04] and find people to edit your work and to look at it.
[00:07] I have a little slack workspace that has three people in it,
[00:11] me and two other women who are product leaders.
[00:14] And we oftentimes send each other our work still.
[00:18] And we say, like, hey, I'm struggling with this.
[00:20] Like, can you read it?
[00:21] Help me make it simpler.
[00:22] Can you help me fix this up?
[00:24] And we do that for each other.
[00:25] So find a peer, you know,
[00:26] maybe who's in a non-competitive space.
[00:27] Who can do that for you?
[00:28] I mean, I still use those people to help me.
[00:31] That is extremely cool.
[00:33] Can you talk more about this group that you have?
[00:34] Yeah, I don't know if it's a group.
[00:36] It's like three friends.
[00:38] Shout out Alexa and Daphne.
[00:41] Yeah, I mean, the three of us all worked together
[00:42] when we were at Drift.
[00:43] We've stayed in touch.
[00:45] And I've just found that in order to be good
[00:48] at your job continuously,
[00:49] you need people who can help give you feedback and that.
[00:52] And the more senior you get, the harder that is.
[00:54] And so having people who can give you
[00:57] another point of view, who maybe you can vent to
[01:00] if it's not appropriate as a leader,
[01:02] who can give you other experiences
[01:03] that they're going through has been incredibly valuable.
[01:06] And so we just have a little group chat
[01:08] that is focused on product.
[01:10] That is so cool.
[01:11] Any, is there like a tip you could share
[01:13] for someone that wants to create something like this?
[01:14] Is it important for you to have worked with them before?
[01:17] Is Slack a good way to communicate anything there
[01:19] that's just like, oh yeah, here's a cool tip?
[01:21] Slack just worked for us
[01:22] because that's where we are during the day.
[01:24] And I think having easy access to it was important.
[01:27] You could probably use WhatsApp
[01:28] or a group text.
[01:30] There are small community.
[01:32] There's one I worked in healthcare for a year and a bit
[01:35] and there's a Slack community
[01:37] that somebody organized for heads of products
[01:39] and healthcare startups that is similar.
[01:41] And it was really, really powerful
[01:42] and a really great space to be in.
[01:44] And so you just have to kind of suss out
[01:46] where these things are.
[01:47] You work with amazing people
[01:49] and there's people around you
[01:50] who are going to become your friends.
[01:51] And so keep an eye out for them
[01:53] and keep in touch with them
[01:54] when you leave a job
[01:54] because you never know when they might become your little.
