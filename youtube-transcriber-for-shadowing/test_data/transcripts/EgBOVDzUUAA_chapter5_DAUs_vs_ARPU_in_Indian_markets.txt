============================================================

[00:00] I want to keep talking about India and how it's different and especially what may surprise
[00:07] people about the market, both building there and then how to build products that are successful
[00:10] in India.
[00:11] I saw in a different interview, you talk about how there's this big difference between
[00:15] DAOs and ARPUs, that in India, it's really easy to get DAOs, basically get lots of
[00:20] users, really hard to make revenue per user.
[00:24] And that changes the way you build product, probably could just talk about why this
[00:28] is the case.
[00:29] Why is it something that you get DAOs versus ARPUs?
[00:31] So I think ARPU is a function of per capita income of a country.
[00:37] You cannot make $100 per user from a country for a product when their income is, let's say
[00:43] $2,500 per year as an average for a poor country.
[00:48] So what happens is, many global companies love to come to India because we have the
[00:53] cheapest data, very high smartphone penetration.
[00:57] So if you look at a lot of global giants, they have 500 million users from India or sometimes
[01:01] a billion numbers coming from Asia.
[01:04] And they don't have huge ARPUs, but they help you show the user growth, which helps you
[01:08] in your public market and therefore improve your valuations.
[01:12] For example, my guess is that I don't know if this data is public or not, or talk
[01:17] about my guess is that Meta would not have more than $3 or $4 per user per year monetization
[01:23] in India.
[01:24] But if you look at the user growth in India, it will be huge.
[01:29] So a lot of times, for global companies, India becomes a great MAU firm, but very low on ARPU.
[01:37] And therefore, a lot of Indian founders who try to copy the Western markets in the long
[01:40] going to have 200 million users make a terrible mistake because they will need to then
[01:44] go abroad to find their ARPUs to balance the act.
[01:48] You talk about how Netflix is a good example that where they launch in India, they
[01:51] got lots of users, but just couldn't make a lot of money.
[01:54] Yeah, because for that users to find relevant content and pay for content when we have tons
[02:01] of free data, tons of free content all over the place, like short videos that are competing
[02:06] with time, like so much going on over here, people actually paying for that by design
[02:12] is going to be less.
[02:13] And I'm not saying that it will not change in 10, 20 years, but the expectation that
[02:17] many global companies come over here saying, oh, I'm going to have these tens of millions
[02:22] of users who start paying me as soon as they come for Spotify, for Netflix, for almost anybody
[02:28] with or Amazon Prime for that matter has not panned out.
[02:33] So one of my takeaways here is just when you look at a startup as an investor, especially
[02:36] when you see like, we've got 100 million users, don't treat that the same as, let's
[02:42] say 100 million users in the US or other markets.
[02:45] Absolutely.
