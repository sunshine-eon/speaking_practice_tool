Time: 62:49 - 70:02
============================================================

[00:00] Dimitri, before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that
[00:04] we haven't touched on that you think might be really helpful for listeners to hear,
[00:07] maybe a less wisdom nugget that you haven't already shared or even just something to kind
[00:13] of double down on that you've already shared?
[00:14] No, I think that it was an amazing chat and thanks, Lenya.
[00:19] We covered a lot of different topics.
[00:20] I would just maybe summarize that if you're excited to build certain things, never hesitate
[00:29] to do it.
[00:31] The best way to do it is probably your own startup and it also what will give you the
[00:37] steepest possible learning curve.
[00:40] But then if you want to join a company, try to choose the one that has the highest entrepreneurial
[00:46] spirit and that will allow you to work as closer to a mode of a founder as you possibly
[00:54] can.
[00:55] It's a recurring theme in these conversations I'm having with companies that produce the
[01:00] PMs that have the steepest career trajectory.
[01:05] And so that advice is exactly what I'm taking away from this too.
[01:08] Assuming you want your career to accelerate really quickly after you go work at this company.
[01:13] Okay, Dimitri, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.
[01:16] Are you ready?
[01:17] Yes, let's go.
[01:18] Here we go.
[01:19] Okay, first question.
[01:21] What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?
[01:26] The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz.
[01:30] Actually read it quite some time ago, but I found myself recommending it to other product
[01:36] managers most often.
[01:38] It's actually illustrative that to be a great product manager, someone needs to strive to
[01:50] be in a great CEO.
[01:53] And besides this book emphasizes the importance of building systematic solutions and scalable
[01:59] solutions which is critical for scaling company.
[02:03] Also being honest on how important it is to grind stuff.
[02:11] And then second book is, I read it more recently, Built by Tony Fidel.
[02:18] I was really inspired by this one, especially given how I appreciate how it's not easy to
[02:25] build hardware and what Tony was describing there.
[02:30] It's just super exciting and inspiring.
[02:33] And also I think that there are different archetypes of product managers.
[02:39] There are people who tend to disrupt things more.
[02:42] Personally, I think about myself as a builder.
[02:45] So Tony's principle that he highlighted in the book, they resonate with me a lot.
[02:55] I'm trying to get Tony on the podcast.
[02:57] If anyone listening knows Tony Fidel and can nudge him, hey, say yes to Lenny.
[03:01] That'd be great.
[03:02] I've been in touch with his team.
[03:03] He's not doing podcasts right now, but I'm trying to get him on.
[03:05] Okay, move it on.
[03:06] Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?
[03:09] I think the last movie I watched was Oppenheimer and I really liked it.
[03:16] I always love watching biopics.
[03:20] I think they give you kind of a perspective and let you think about things in perspective.
[03:27] Is there a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?
[03:31] Manos is a great thing.
[03:34] The AI agent?
[03:35] Yeah, yeah.
[03:36] It's just like I was super impressed.
[03:39] I was mesmerized.
[03:40] It's all autonomous and smooth.
[03:42] I just spent a few hours vibe coding and I created this JavaScript app that sends me
[03:55] a rare English word every day to learn and remember.
[04:01] It worked and I was just amazed.
[04:04] What's a word you learned?
[04:05] Ineffable.
[04:06] It was the year's worth.
[04:08] I love that it's still going.
[04:10] That's great.
[04:11] Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful in worker
[04:17] and life?
[04:18] I love this phrase.
[04:20] I think Eisenhower said it.
[04:23] Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.
[04:27] It's like, you know, we often say how important it is to be flexible and agile and just to
[04:34] have a change in circumstances.
[04:37] But it doesn't allow us to actually not have a plan at all.
[04:41] It's important for us to remember that, you know, we always need to think many steps ahead
[04:46] and while being flexible, we also need to think things thoroughly.
[04:52] Final question.
[04:55] For folks that are maybe checking out Revolute for the first time that want to play with
[04:58] it already, users, what's the most underrated feature?
[05:01] What's something that you think people should check out?
[05:02] Maybe they're not aware of or even just like a UX, I don't know, animation, something fun
[05:07] that people may not know about.
[05:10] The thing that is not yet widely used, but I really loved it, is what we call a wealth
[05:17] protection.
[05:18] So if you go to settings, you can enable a limit for any transfers outside of Revolute.
[05:24] And if you want to do a transfer above this limit, you will have to do a selfie check,
[05:28] which is our proprietary technology.
[05:29] We do a video selfie and it allows us to make sure that it's you, no one else is doing the
[05:35] transfer.
[05:37] And it's actually, it's almost as smooth as Face ID and the way team built it is really
[05:46] great.
[05:47] I'm really proud of those guys.
[05:48] Dmitry, you guys are doing something very special.
[05:51] I really appreciate you spending so much time with me chatting through all the things you
[05:55] guys have figured out.
[05:56] I think that's going to help a lot of different companies level up the way they think about
[05:59] product and for people to join Revolute that want to experience this and accelerate their
[06:03] career.
[06:04] So thank you for being here.
[06:06] Two final questions.
[06:07] Where can folks find you if they want to reach out?
[06:09] And how can listeners be useful to you?
[06:10] I think the best way is to find me on LinkedIn.
[06:14] And yeah, I would be happy to receive a note from anyone on how we can improve the product
[06:21] and your feedback on the product.
[06:22] And also, if you know someone who can be a great fit to Revolute after you've listened
[06:31] to what I've told, then yeah, I would be grateful for that as well.
[06:37] Awesome.
[06:38] You're about to get a flood of applications.
[06:39] Get prepared.
[06:40] Dmitry, thank you.
[06:41] Look forward to that.
[06:42] Yeah.
[06:43] Yeah.
[06:44] Lenny, thanks a lot.
[06:45] It was amazing.
[06:46] Thanks for being here.
[06:47] Thank you very much.
[06:48] Same.
