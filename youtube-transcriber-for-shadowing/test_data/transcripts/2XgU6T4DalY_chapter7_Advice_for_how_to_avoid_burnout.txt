============================================================

[00:00] Another thing someone may be feeling when they're hearing this is like, oh my god
[00:03] It's gonna be take me so many hours to just get it to a place Elizabeth is happy with and I know you said that this doesn't mean
[00:09] necessarily many hours
[00:11] Do you have any advice or thoughts on just how to avoid like burnout and working all the time?
[00:15] But also keeping this really high bar and high expectations
[00:19] It truly is not about time. I even found myself in a meeting earlier today saying
[00:24] If we're clear in the objectives of something it might be that the last
[00:33] 20% of polish on the document is a really bad use of time
[00:38] so if we're gonna come together to talk through
[00:42] Like quarterly business review was the example. What were the highlights? What were the lowlights?
[00:46] What were the learnings from the quarter?
[00:49] Where are there places of misalignment?
[00:52] The reason we're doing the quarterly business review is to have a really candid conversation about how we think things are going to have a debate about
[00:59] Things where maybe we're stuck. It's not to have a perfectly polished document for that conversation
[01:05] So my feedback in that instance would be I would much rather have someone spend the time thinking about what's the conversation?
[01:12] We really want to have how do I tee that up?
[01:15] Not could I spend another 20 hours to make it look like everything's perfect in this document?
[01:20] And so I think in that sense it's
[01:23] It's not just excellence like you wrote the perfect document
[01:26] I should probably be careful to not use that as the only example
[01:30] But instead we really got to the outcome
[01:33] We wanted to get to you because we were thoughtful about it and we put a lot of energy and time and iteration into making sure we got to that outcome
[01:41] And is this an example where you gave someone feedback because they spent too much time on the polish?
[01:45] Or is this earlier and they give the pyramid of this framework you kind of shared?
[01:49] Have said expectations give specific feedback help them fill the gap and then do it in private
[01:53] Is this like the expectation setting in this example or is this like feedback you spend too much time on?
[01:58] This is expectation setting
[02:00] So one of the things in my new role is that there's some practices that the team has had where they're trying to
[02:07] Understand are we still going to have those practices?
[02:09] What's going to be the same versus different about those things and get an understanding of my expectations?
[02:15] So it's great that people ask that question
[02:18] So that I can be clear about oh wait
[02:21] If you're on the last 20 percent of this polishing the dock
[02:24] I'd rather spend time over here
[02:26] And here's how I would like the conversation to go
[02:29] So we all get something out of it instead of it feeling like it's just a leadership reviewer on my behalf
[02:35] So this in this specific situation it was setting expectations ahead of time so that we can set everyone up for success
