============================================================

Jeff, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Thanks, Lenny. It's great to be here.

So, you are head of product at Ramp. For people not familiar with Ramp, could you just give us a brief overview of what it is that Ramp does?

Yeah, Ramp is a finance automation platform and corporate card solution for small to medium-sized businesses. We help businesses essentially automate most things across expense management, card payments, bill payments, and accounting. We've helped 15,000 of such businesses automate a lot of their back office to focus on what really matters, which is growing their company and providing value to their customers.

Okay, so what you didn't mention are some of the most interesting stats about Ramp and the business, as well as the growth story of Ramp. Could you just also share some stats about the success of Ramp in a sense of just how rare the story of Ramp has been?

Yeah, I mean, we were one of the fastest growing fintech and maybe SaaS companies of all time. I think we've hit 100 million in annual recurring revenue in our first two years, and we've continued to grow significantly since then. I think every day about a thousand users join our platform. This year, we've grown to hit six hundred million in savings and eight point five million an hour saved for our customers by controlling spend and automating a lot of the manual tasks. So, we're going to continue to grow fast.

In terms of just raw transaction volume, you know, we have crossed 10 billion in spending on the platform, and we're just getting started.
