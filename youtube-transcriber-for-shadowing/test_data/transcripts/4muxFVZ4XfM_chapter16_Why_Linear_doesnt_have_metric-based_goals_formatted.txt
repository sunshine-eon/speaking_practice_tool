============================================================

You mentioned earlier that you don't set metrics goals, so let me delve into that a little bit. Is that true? You don't really have a number of goals for features, for launches, and things like that? Let me start there, and I have a follow-up question.

Yeah, so we might have a company-level goal sometimes, like for example, weekly active users. That's a metric we want to increase or something, but in terms of specific features, we don't have goals for those. The reason is that I think of our product as a system that is used by different kinds of companies. It's like a system made of multiple different parts, and it's not necessarily about optimizing any specific thing about it.

Also, companies are a little bit different, so their usage of different features can vary. They operate slightly differently, their team size is different, the setup of the team is different, or the culture is different. For example, with apps like Instagram, the main focus is on driving engagement, and that's the main metric for every feature. We don't have that approach; we think that there should be features that help companies.

Sometimes we can look at the metrics before we start working on a feature to see what the state of things are, but we don't necessarily want to set a goal like, "Oh, we need to increase this specific metric by X." It's more about wanting to solve a problem. Ideally, success looks like customers agreeing that the problem is solved or that they enjoy the solution, rather than simply metrics going up.
