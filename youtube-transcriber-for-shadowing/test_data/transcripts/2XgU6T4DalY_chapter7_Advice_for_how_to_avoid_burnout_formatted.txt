Another thing someone may be feeling when they're hearing this is, "Oh my god, it's going to take me so many hours to just get it to a place Elizabeth is happy with." I know you said that this doesn't necessarily mean many hours. Do you have any advice or thoughts on how to avoid burnout and working all the time while still keeping this really high bar and high expectations? 

It truly is not about time. I even found myself in a meeting earlier today saying that if we're clear in the objectives of something, it might be that the last 20% of polish on the document is a really bad use of time. If we're going to come together to talk through something like a quarterly business review, we should focus on the highlights, lowlights, learnings from the quarter, and places of misalignment. The reason we're doing the quarterly business review is to have a candid conversation about how we think things are going and to debate areas where we might be stuck. It's not about having a perfectly polished document for that conversation.

So my feedback in that instance would be that I would much rather have someone spend the time thinking about the conversation we really want to have and how to tee that up, rather than spending another 20 hours to make everything look perfect in the document. In that sense, it's not just about excellence; it's about reaching the outcome we wanted because we were thoughtful about it and invested energy and time into making sure we achieved that outcome.

Is this an example where you gave someone feedback because they spent too much time on the polish? Or is this earlier in the process, where they received the pyramid of the framework you shared? Have you set expectations, given specific feedback, helped them fill the gap, and then done it in private? Is this about expectation setting in this example, or is it feedback about spending too much time on polish?

This is expectation setting. One of the things in my new role is that there are some practices the team has had where they're trying to understand whether we will continue those practices. They want to know what's going to be the same versus different and get an understanding of my expectations. It's great that people ask that question so I can clarify that if they're on the last 20% of polishing the document, I would rather they spend time on other priorities. Here’s how I would like the conversation to go, so we all get something out of it instead of it feeling like just a leadership review on my behalf. 

In this specific situation, it was about setting expectations ahead of time to ensure we can set everyone up for success.
