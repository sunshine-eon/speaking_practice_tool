============================================================

[00:00] You mentioned decision-making. There's something interesting there. Talk about how you make decisions
[00:03] at HubSpot. Like most organizations HubSpot historically has made decisions poorly. It's
[00:10] just all spectrum, right? I think decisions are one of the hardest things because it's
[00:13] hard to strike the balance. And we've evolved it over. I think we're much better
[00:19] than we were in our earlier years. The things we get wrong, most people get wrong. And so
[00:24] I'll tell you the things we get right now is that we're very data-oriented. We like to make
[00:33] data-informed decisions, but data doesn't make decisions people do. So that's like thing number
[00:39] one. You have lots of geeky founding companies or whatever. It's like, oh, we have a chart that
[00:43] says this, so we should go do that. That doesn't work. Data is awesome. And we also
[00:51] have one position that we designate to make the decision. And that is not necessarily
[00:56] the executive overoring that team. It's like, okay, well, so-and-so. And they literally own that. And
[01:02] we didn't invent this idea either. This existed long before HubSpot. But it actually works. It's
[01:06] like you have to decide who's going to make the decision. And that is the almost the number
[01:11] one decision to make. And it's like, okay, don't pick people you don't trust to make the
[01:15] decision. And so that's kind of thing number two. And the biggest mistake, and we used
[01:19] to make this much more than we make now is, and this and Amazon stayed this really well,
[01:27] they have theirs is called disagree and commit. We have a slight twist. And I'll tell you why we
[01:33] twisted a little bit. Ours is debate decide unite. That's our kind of phrase that we use in HubSpot
[01:39] culture. But the idea here, the core premise of it is that once you make a decision, getting
[01:45] alignment around that decision, because there will always be any amount of scale,
[01:49] people that disagreed with that decision, because they were debating the other side,
[01:52] right? Like they just didn't, like they went, they would have picked option A,
[01:55] and we ended up picking option B. But it's extremely important that even when a decision
[02:02] gets made, and we decide to do something that's contrary to the thing that you believe
[02:05] it would have debated for and did debate for, you lost on that particular one. Fine.
[02:10] Hard to do, but so important, so valuable. And I'll tell you why we tweaked the Amazon one. So the
[02:18] disagree and commit sounds a little bit harsher than we like, right? Which is fine for you to
[02:25] disagree, but then effing commit, right? It's like, okay, I get that. I'm biased. But so the
[02:33] debate is, okay, so let's have open debate. Let's get all the options on the table.
[02:37] Let's actually make the decision. And then it's unite around that decision, not just,
[02:42] it's like, okay, let's kind of come together around that. And that sounds more Hubspotty.
[02:49] It is a lot more friendly. I was thinking that as you were talking. Debate, decide, unite,
[02:53] versus disagree and commit. And then there's like have backbone, you know, in that one. It's,
[02:58] yeah. The other thing I'll tell you, this is partly Hubspotty, partly a me thing.
[03:04] And this will not surprise you at all is I like to think systematically around decisions, right?
[03:13] And so I'll give you an example. The question I asked myself when faced with a decision or a thing
[03:20] that I'm trying to do is like, okay, if I could write Python code of Python function
[03:25] to come up with an answer to this, what would be variables or the coefficients?
[03:33] Let's say you're not, if you're making Excel spreadsheet to make this decision,
[03:37] what would the columns be? All right. You have to decide the weights,
[03:40] but at least decide the factors. Then the next step is like, okay, you're the factors that I think
[03:44] matter of the making of this decision. I'm going to decide between these seven options,
[03:47] here are the things I'm going to look at, right? Like you would do this for
[03:49] picking a school to go to or, you know, it's like, it works, right? And you'll have to take it
[03:54] to the end of the degree, but the exercise of going through it is like, okay, well,
[03:57] step one, if I can just identify the factors that I think should impact this decision,
[04:03] that's an 80% window right there. Not because it's just in your head. If the team works
[04:08] collectively to say, okay, here are all the factors that I think should contribute to the
[04:11] making of this decision, then number two is, okay, we can't assign exact weights so we
[04:18] can't write the Excel formula just yet or the Python code, but can we at least
[04:21] stack rate the factors? Like this factor is more important than that factor. Now you get
[04:25] a closer sense of approximation, right? You're still not going to use the spreadsheet to make
[04:29] the decision, but the human making a decision has much better information they have than
[04:35] pretty going through that exercise. One of the mistakes people make around decisions,
[04:38] and Amazon has written about this, I'll give you kind of my take on it, is that
[04:43] the calories you spend on a decision should be proportional to the consequences of that decision.
[04:50] Apparently, he calls them one way doors versus two way doors, which is a kind of a binary heuristic,
[04:55] which is I love the elegance and simplicity of that. I'm taking it one level further,
[04:59] which is it literally should be proportional. Like, okay, if you have a really, really big
[05:03] decision that's going to be expensive to change, really, really, but a lot of calories
[05:07] making that decision, you might still get it wrong, but it's worth it, right?
[05:10] And it's not just around decisions, around activities and things that you're going to do
[05:15] is that the calories you spend should be kind of proportional to the outcomes and what you're
[05:21] seeking and the value of it. And that's one of the things I try to apply to my life. It's like,
[05:24] okay, my geeky nature wants me to go nine-months deep and start writing code and do this thing
[05:29] or whatever. But I found that that one simple thing is like, okay, is this like a first
[05:36] order approximation where I can just identify the factors or I can like,
[05:40] and the other thing that helps, by the way, is then we'll talk about this. So one of, is
[05:46] my default position on most things, and I don't mean this in a negative way, is no.
[05:50] It's like, oh, shiny object, should I go do this? No. And then I have to sort of force
[05:55] myself, like, okay, like, I need like reasons to say yes, I have to kind of force myself
[05:59] because it's easy to say I love new things, I love new people, like, I love all that.
[06:04] Is then, so I have like a, sorry, but no post on my blog that life-changing for me.
[06:13] And so the idea there is that this goes back to other first principles is time is what a few
[06:21] kind of constants, right? So every time you say yes to something by definition,
[06:25] you're saying no to something else. And so this goes back to the kind of product
[06:30] curiosity we were using in the early years of house class, like, oh, when you put something in,
[06:33] you have to take something out because we want to kind of keep the complexity,
[06:35] you're roughly constant if we can. Same thing. So it's okay to say yes to things,
[06:39] but then you have to force yourself based on the calories that you're committing to
[06:43] to say, okay, well, what am I going to take out of my schedule out of my life in order
[06:47] for me to be able to make room for this thing? Because at the time, I have not been able
[06:51] to, despite my best attempts, bend the laws of space and time. So how do I make room for this?
