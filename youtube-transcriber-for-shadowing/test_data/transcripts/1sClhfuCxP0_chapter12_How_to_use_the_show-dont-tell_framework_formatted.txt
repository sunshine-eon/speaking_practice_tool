So essentially, just getting very detailed and very concrete with the product experience that you're building is crucial. Thinking about the user experience sounds like a lot of work. I can't imagine you do this often. Is the advice here to do this once a year or once and just kind of keep it updated? It sounds like you did this at Swiggy, and that was a really impactful way of building the product.

I think this is not only one way at Swiggy. I recommend that every product manager do a "show, don't tell" version of their current version. At the same time, this is a new version all the time, so they can compare and contrast and very easily explain to everyone why they're doing something. In fact, that wall sits called "the wall" also becomes one common place where you can get all the stakeholders involved. Instead of just doing the elevator pitch, you can actually have detailed discussions on why you're choosing this versus something else and so on and so forth.

That's a product manager's version of doing this, but there's also a product leader's version of this learning, which is a cycle strategy on a page. A lot of people call it growth loops. Instead of showing a user journey, let's see the entire strategy of the company together on one page. This is what the market looks like, why we will get what kind of users, what our activation budgets are, and how many of them we’re going to get to the next stage to get them to use it. How will we get them to cross-pollinate to different sections? Do we need a membership program? Are there different levers we can press more or less, and so on? 

That also is like a "show, don't tell." Not only one, but usually, I like to create three of them as well. Why would we choose one strategy versus the other? For example, this is a very good way for product leaders to align with their CXOs on one strategy and something that they can essentially communicate to the entire product and other teams. This is what we're going to follow.
