============================================================

[00:00] Awesome. So that's a good segue to another area. I wanted to spend some time, which is the linear method
[00:05] You espouse this way of building product
[00:07] You call the linear method which you publish online and willing to in the show notes
[00:11] And I just want to ask a few questions around this way of building product
[00:16] One is you are big on this idea of building opinionated software
[00:21] Can you talk about just what does that mean?
[00:23] And then maybe give an example or two of how you actually have done that a linear
[00:27] So first like with the linear method what we
[00:30] Why why did we create it in the first place?
[00:32] It's like we just believe that there is more of like this modern ways of building software and thinking about it
[00:37] And we wanted to like share some of our our thinking on it
[00:41] And that's kind of like also it relates to how we build linear as well
[00:45] Like so you might like
[00:47] Understand why we make some choices because this is like the way we think about making these choices
[00:52] So we're trying to like share our thinking behind the product and notice like here's the product and like figure it out
[00:58] Yeah, so like the opinionated piece like I personally have like this belief that
[01:03] Productivity software should be and especially
[01:07] Company software should be opinionated
[01:09] I think that like what the productivity software is trying to do is is like
[01:15] Make people productive and I think like what what productive means is like you actually do something that matters for the company
[01:22] Which is which is like I don't know built some new feature or like fix something or design something
[01:27] Like all of those things are like eventually they provide some kind of value for the customer
