============================================================

[00:00] Kind of along the lines of people and where you learn from, is there any sources of content?
[00:05] This is actually an audience question on Twitter.
[00:07] Anurag Verma asked this, what are your favorite sources of content to learn from in terms of
[00:13] what's happening in the world and what to pay attention to?
[00:16] I wish I could think of an answer.
[00:19] My method of collecting information is mostly about I come up with conjectures in my head
[00:25] and then I go all over the place to find out if there are proofs of what I'm saying is true
[00:32] or not.
[00:33] For example, I recently came up with a conjecture that everybody who's been successful in the
[00:37] history of business or vices have historically done a lot of philanthropy to create a good
[00:44] image for themselves and therefore being treated as a respected citizen versus being
[00:49] treated as a person who did vices to make wealth.
[00:53] Then I asked this to GPT and GPT came up with 50 people who did what and what were the vices,
[00:59] how did they change the reputation by doing lots of philanthropy and all of that stuff.
[01:05] Then a thing happens and then I research in all sorts of directions and I have no boundaries
[01:10] to if I go to chemistry or physics or human behavior to some universal principles.
[01:17] My method of learning is constantly come up with conjectures from the Dock City
[01:22] of Connected and then absolutely work hard to find proof of it and then use that to connect
[01:29] to the next dot.
[01:30] I often tell people that every book you read makes your brain porous to read the next book.
[01:39] That's the purpose of books but that's true for every single thing we learn.
[01:42] It makes our brain more porous for the next thing that we are supposed to learn.
[01:45] Is there a recent example of that where you got super sucked into some topic?
[01:50] It's my daily life I get sucked into topics every now and then.
[01:54] For example, I've been thinking about second order effects of AI and what happens to countries
[02:01] and jobs and how to expect some of these things to change, not change.
[02:05] Rate of change, rate of skill change.
[02:08] I got recently obsessed with what happens to lab grown diamonds.
[02:11] If they become big, does it kill diamonds?
[02:13] Does it make diamonds bigger?
[02:15] And then I looked at parallel, so pearl industry was very big before cultured pearls came and
[02:24] the high status of pearls disappeared because everybody could have pearls.
[02:28] But not too long ago, pearls was to be a very royal thing to be every prince and princesses
[02:35] used to have pearls around them.
[02:36] But as soon as it was easy to manufacture in a lab, it lost its value.
[02:43] So then it should be shorting or going long on diamonds, thinking about what happens.
[02:47] So, but there'll be a temporary period of making a lot of money on lab grown
[02:51] diamonds which will kill, it will become parasitic on the status of diamonds
[02:56] and destroy all its profit pools.
[03:00] You heard of your first time to buy some diamond futures.
[03:03] I feel like there's no one in the world chat GPT impacted more than you
[03:08] considering how much you want to spend digging into random top.
