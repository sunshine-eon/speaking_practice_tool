============================================================

Let's get all your gummy bears. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready? 

Yeah, let's do it. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people? The first one is called *Thinking in Systems*. It's the one I give kind of the team every now and then. It's just a really good book about how people say systems can be abstract. I think it goes into real detail on how people can intervene at various parts and take actions in different systems. I really enjoyed that book. 

Directly, maybe a book I recommend, but a book that I just read that I thought was phenomenal is called *Tomorrow, Tomorrow and Tomorrow*. I was recommending it to my friend. Have you read it? 

Yeah, I honestly didn't love it, but I liked it a lot. For some reason, I thought it was very well done. There are a couple of chapters I reflected on. I just finished it, and I thought it was well done. So that's one that I'll throw out there. 

Yeah, it was very sweet. I feel like I got hyped too much for me. I'm like, okay, I didn't know it got the key publicity. 

Okay, that's it. The third one that I just downloaded, because I finished, I'm actually going to open up my audiobook and tell you because I'm about, I don't know, an hour into it and I'm really enjoying it. It is *An Immense World*. I don't know if you've read that one yet. It is about animals and how they have different senses. It goes through a set of different animals and how they see the world. It’s just a reminder that we're so limited sometimes in our own perception. For instance, dogs can breathe in and take in scents even when they're breathing out. They're constantly sensing, almost like vision. It's phenomenal to think about all the things they probably sense as my dog and I go on our walks. I've learned that dogs shoot air out of their noses first before they smell to clear things out. Isn't that wild? They can probably see so much more of what happened in the history of a little walk than we're able to just because of that. Incredible. 

Next question. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show? 

One thing we try to do is watch TV as a family, which kind of brings us together a little bit. We are doing *Star Wars* with the kids for the first time, which has been a really enjoyable experience, just being able to witness it through them. Then we've been going a little bit back in time, so we watched *E.T.*, which is fun. It jogs memories. These are phenomenal movies that we go through. 

I think your question is on recent TV shows that probably came up more recently. Those work just as well. The other one I did like, it's not a TV show, but it's called *Case 63*. It was that podcast that came out, *Case 63*, I think it was called. I hope that's the right name of it. It was a sci-fi podcast, about 10 minutes short. The premise is someone comes from the future and there's a bit of speculative fiction, and it's at a psychologist. It's just a phenomenal piece. I have to get you the real name. Maybe I can get it for the show. 

Yeah, we'll edit your words and add whatever's in the show notes. 

What is a favorite interview question you like to ask? 

I do like to ask people what the most complex thing they ever built was. I love to understand where they gravitate to. Is that something you're up to? And two, are they able to simplify it? I think those are two really important skills. 

What is it that you look for in their answer that tells you it was a good answer? 

Both of those things. First, did they take on something that was super complex? Really, really hard? I think there's only a particular group who will gravitate to those kinds of realms. More and more, I think that a lot of the ways the world is going to get better is by solving things that are really hard. You can think about how intimacy doesn't scale, right? When you think about how people are going to feel more connected, it's going to be a lot more difficult to solve. When you think about health care, it's very difficult to solve. Education is a very interconnected space. 

People who gravitate to those hard problems have a very special kind of gift, and it's hard to replicate that passion. So one, did you do that? And then two, people who really understand systems are able to simplify it. They're able to explain it and say, "This is how I looked at it, but here's how I modeled it." Even if it's nonlinear, they're able to say, "This is how the cause and effect works." I'm really looking for, once you did it, did you really understand it? Were you able to crack it? Or at least did you understand why you weren't able to crack it? I usually find this to be the most rewarding conversations. 

Awesome. Thanks for sharing all that. 

Next question. What is a favorite recent product that you've discovered that you love? 

I'll give you one more dead one. My youngest just hates brushing his teeth and there is, I should actually find the name of the toothbrush, but you can just Google or Amazon this and you'll figure it out. It was basically a baby shark toothbrush, but it's a game. You play that game for two minutes and try to pick up different prizes while you brush your teeth. What I loved about it is that it turns a moment of annoyance into a moment of joy. It went from being an unreasonable experience to now he loves it. It was just so well done. It's like 10 bucks and it was 10 bucks extremely well spent. So much light. Whoever made that toothbrush, thank you. 

Damn. Is it playing baby shark? 

I hope not. Well, it can; it has that feature and capability, but it is a small price to pay for me to enjoy good times. 

What's something relatively minor that you've changed in your product development process that has had a big impact on your team's ability to execute? 

I do like to change things every quarter or six months, kind of sit down and say, what can we get better at? The two areas I find myself innovating or tweaking the most are around planning. I think every company struggles with this, and as you get bigger, it probably becomes a bigger difference, especially when we talk about the complexity of the ecosystem. 

We started this thing where we call it orange and red priorities. A lot of times, what people do is teams will plan bottom-up, come into a manager or leader, and then the leader may shift things around or say it this way. We've really started shifting it in a different way. We said, these are the big rocks we have to get done. We're going to get those things done first. We're going to be upfront and honest with you about these priorities, and then you can plan from there. I think it's relieved a lot of the progress. There’s an honesty that comes with it, and that's been a big change. 

The other is kind of the way we review products. That's always been a thing. My read is that when we keep our product review process live too long, it gets a little institutionalized and people start making long documents. So we always have to change that every quarter. It always comes down to the same thing: how do you get the problem statement quickly, and how do you design from there? The lever we put in place for that was really shortening the time. I'm trying this thing; I don't know if it's going to work, but could we get to 15-minute reviews instead of an hour and see if that alleviates some of this? I'll let you know how it goes when we chat next. I'm very curious to see if this is going to be a different kind of system where we might be able to get to clarity quicker or realize we're not in clarity and then break and come back. 

Reminds me of a tweet I think I just saw, maybe it was an Instagram post, of teams that do standups while doing a plank to keep the meeting really short. 

That's interesting. I haven't tried that one yet, but it might be something we try next. 

Last question. You've been at LinkedIn for a long time. I imagine you use LinkedIn a lot. Is there just a pro tip that you can share on how to be more successful with LinkedIn, buy more value from LinkedIn, enjoy more? 

The first is, I do think there are ways that skills work as we infer skills, but I think there is a skill section on the profile. A lot of people ignore it because they don't realize there's value in it, and that's changing, but I'm not sure if it's changing for everybody. I would pay more attention to skills as we get more into it. 

The second thing I would probably do, I don't know if it's that hidden, but I would check out LinkedIn Learning. I think LinkedIn Learning is a gem. Because it's sold largely through enterprises, a lot of people miss it. I would hope you check it out, but more importantly, tell me areas that we could get better on there as well. I hope people will find value. 

What's the best way to find out about LinkedIn Learning? 

They just Google LinkedIn Learning and they'll find the LinkedIn backslash learning. 

Yeah, LinkedIn.com slash learning. 

Okay, great. Hari, I feel like we've opened the mind of Hari up on this podcast. I appreciate you being here. 

Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, and how can listeners be useful to you? 

You can find me on LinkedIn; that's an easy one. I really appreciate product feedback. I promise you, I take it well. For those listening, it is really hard to know sometimes what the experience is because you're living in a very abstracted ecosystem. The more you could just say, "Hey, this is working or not," and the intentions are coming from a good place. If you have a moment and you're not having a great experience or are having a great experience, you can write it. I would really appreciate hearing your perspective. 

Amazing. Hari, thank you so much for being here. 

Thanks, Lenny. It’s great meeting you.
