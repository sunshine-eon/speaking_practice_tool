So, I asked on Twitter what questions to ask you, and there's a great question that came in from Non-You, who is the head of product for Linear. He asks, what practices does Netflix do that other companies should not attempt to do because their talent level is so much higher than other companies? That is freedom and responsibility in a nutshell. Let me explain that.

It's a good question, and it's kind of related to what I was saying earlier: talent density is a prerequisite for a lot of the other ways we operate. If we want to create a work environment where we are not prescriptive about how people solve problems or the scope of problems they could tackle—assuming they're highly impactful for the business—we can't have a lot of process around that work. 

Think about being able to make large innovations to our engineering systems or introducing new ways to think about metrics and experimentation. We get a lot of those things because we give people the freedom and the space to explore, question things, and experiment with solutions. I think that would be very hard, if not dangerous, if we didn't have a high talent density.

It's really not a top-down, do A then B then C approach. Even in how we go through some of our planning processes or think about priorities, there is a lot of room for contribution across all levels of the team, and that requires talent density. 

Then there are things like, you have to have amazing people if you're not going to have really strict guardrails that would influence the consumer experience or business stakeholders' experience. We do give people a lot of responsibility in those areas. So, I think the lack of process and prescriptiveness hinges on the fact that we've got amazing people who are not only smart but, even better, have strong judgment.
