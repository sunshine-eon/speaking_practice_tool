============================================================

[43:15] and we've been really thinking through it.
[43:17] Let's actually talk about LinkedIn Learning.
[43:18] So I know this is a big passion of yours.
[43:21] You have your own course within this
[43:23] that I want to talk about, but broadly just
[43:25] what is LinkedIn Learning?
[43:26] Just so people understand, because I
[43:27] don't know if a lot of people know this exists within LinkedIn.
[43:29] Great question.
[43:29] LinkedIn Learning is basically a way
[43:31] to learn professional skills.
[43:33] And so we entered the business in 2015,
[43:37] and the thesis was, it's kind of weird.
[43:39] Think about it as a marketplace again.
[43:40] You have seekers and job, and oftentimes,
[43:42] seekers may not have all the skills in order to get the job.
[43:45] You have this long kind of, we're moving now
[43:47] towards the skills model, but with that question,
[43:50] this out of second order impact, I don't think any of us
[43:52] wanted to kind of, if you will, like,
[43:55] Uberize the world.
[43:56] Like, I don't think any of us wanted to make it,
[43:58] and everyone there, we wanted to make sure everyone had
[43:59] the skills in order to learn the skills in order to get there.
[44:02] And so getting the learning business is really, really
[44:05] important for the vision and the mission.
[44:06] And basically, the idea was that we'd
[44:08] have ways to teach people skills that was very much tailored
[44:11] to professionals.
[44:12] Now, that was kind of the vision.
[44:13] The way the mechanism works is we go and get the best
[44:16] instructors in the world.
[44:17] We will bring them into a film studio,
[44:20] and we'll do it at home, or in a way that makes the content
[44:22] extremely, we help write the scripts,
[44:24] we obviously have incredible graphics,
[44:25] or just in a way that makes a teacher and someone who's
[44:28] an expert who may not always have the capability in the sense
[44:31] that the time to go and make their own online course
[44:34] and get them in the studio and go from there.
[44:36] And then the vast majority of people
[44:38] will probably have access through their company.
[44:41] The vast majority of the usage and kind of the business
[44:43] runs through enterprise and is a large enterprise learning
[44:46] problem.
[44:47] Awesome.
[44:47] Like, just as a quarter, I don't know, armchair quarterback
[44:50] strategy person, I could see where this came from of we're
[44:53] trying to help people connect to economic opportunity,
[44:55] find jobs, how do we help them?
[44:56] Oh, they don't have the skills.
[44:57] Let's help them build the skills.
[44:59] Makes a lot of sense.
