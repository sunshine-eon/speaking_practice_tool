============================================================

Okay, so for people that don't know anything about what Duolingo Streaks are, can you just first give a brief explanation of what Duolingo Streaks? What is this feature all about? 

Well, presumably people know Duolingo is a language learning app. The Duolingo Streak tracks currently, anyway, how many days in a row you've done a lesson. So you come to Duolingo, you do a lesson, your first lesson, you know, you'll start a streak, and then every consecutive day that you come, use the app, you'll extend your streak. 

And I should actually put an asterisk around how many days in a row because we also have built flexibility into the features. So we have these things called streak freezes. It's like insurance for your streak. So, you know, it's a pretty simple feature, you know, in theory. But over time, we've layered on challenges and goal setting and rewards and, you know, social features. A lot of our notifications are tied to the streak. So it's a pretty simple feature to understand, but it's been a really rich feature for us to build on top of. 

Some people might be hearing this be like, Duolingo Streaks, what's the big deal? There's other people that are like, holy shit, I want to learn everything I can possibly learn about Duolingo Streaks. So many companies are trying to copy what you've learned from this. Do people sense the impact that this one feature has had on Duolingo's success and growth? 

This is, and this is not just the, you know, subjective retention PM talking, I think this is our biggest feature with the exception of the lessons. And I think it's actually worth noting that the streaks are a great engagement hack. I'm kind of the opinion that any team, you know, any app out there can introduce a streak. If you figure it out, it probably works, you know, to retain users. 

But at the core, like, you have to have an app that people want to use. And people really like using Duolingo. It's fun. It's delightful. You learn something. And so it allows us to layer an engagement mechanic on top of that. The streak is really powerful. So it ships a disgusting amount of DAUs. Again, it is, it is, it is our one of our golden geese. 

And again, what's cool is that like, you know, you look at notifications, notifications for Duolingo is massive. I mean, you know, us sending better, you know, whether it's copy or timing, so many of our notifications work because they reference the streak because users care about the streak. So not only is it itself, us iterating on the streak, a huge driver of DAUs, but it's also something that enables other really high, you know, valuable features. 

I was looking up some stats before I came on, and it's pretty crazy. So we have right now over nine million users with a year plus streak. So nine million of our users have had used Duolingo every year, almost every day for, you know, well over a year, which is pretty, which is, I don't know, it's, I like to imagine things in terms of like, you know, okay, well, like if you put all these people in a city or, you know, in a place where it would be and like, ah, it's like a very large city, nine million people. So for a year have been have a year long streak. That's incredible. 

I was just looking at the stock of Duolingo. So Duolingo is a $14 billion company at the time of recording this. It's hitting all time highs too. It's like just keeps going up. I think it doubled in value in the past six months, something like that. And what I'm hearing from you is streaks is this other than just like the core learning feature, which is just like the product of Duolingo. This is the most impactful feature in terms of growth and in that retention specifically. 

I mean, if you look at the numbers, I think pretty objectively has been our biggest growth lever for driving DAUs. I would also say a lot of it's just related to how we think about growth at Duolingo. A lot of what we try to do is organic growth. You know, we think about growth, you know, just as much as bringing new users onto the platform is not losing them. If you're just bringing people onto the platform and they churn, that's not going to be sustainable. 

And so as much as we can do to keep our users coming back and actually retaining as users, it's going to make it, it's going to give us a much easier base to continue growing DAUs off of. Perfect. Okay.
