============================================================

[00:00] There are only three reasons why things do not happen the way you want them to happen as a leader.
[00:04] And you can look at a person and you would say either that person can't do, which is a capability issue,
[00:10] or they won't do, which is a motivation or an alignment issue, or they were not set up to do,
[00:15] which is really your problem that you didn't set up the ways of working in org design properly.
[00:20] So as a leader, do you have the right people in terms of capability?
[00:24] And if not, is the right answer for us to coach them or to like really put them or mentor them and so on,
[00:31] or move them to some other place because maybe the capability is suited elsewhere.
[00:35] If they won't do, why won't they? Are they not aligned to you?
[00:39] Do they not agree with your vision? Do they not have enough time and so on so forth.
[00:44] So you need to really go deeper there. Why won't they do?
[00:47] Today my guest is Anuj Rati.
[00:52] I've been looking to get more India based product leaders on the podcast because this podcast has a large audience in India.
[00:59] And when I put out a call on Twitter and LinkedIn asking people who I should have on, Anuj was the single most requested person.
[01:06] Anuj is Chief Product and Marketing Officer at Jupiter Money.
[01:10] Previously he was Senior Vice President of Revenue and Growth at Swiggy, where he spent seven years.
[01:15] He was also VP of Product at Snapdeal, a senior PM at Walmart Labs, and the very first Product Manager at Flipkart,
[01:22] where he led the buyer experience team.
[01:24] In our conversation, we dig into how product management is different in India.
[01:28] Anuj's lessons about building product experiences for new users, how he operationalized the working backwards process at the companies he's worked at,
[01:37] why he pushes his teams to explore three divergent directions before settling on a plan,
[01:42] why he thinks product managers and companies should be much more full stack than they are,
[01:47] also a bunch of frameworks and contrarian takes about building product and your career and product.
[01:52] A big thank you to Sayan Maiti and Nikhil Khulkarni for helping me navigate the product scene in India.
[01:58] Look for more amazing India based product leaders to come.
[02:02] With that, I bring you Anuj Rati after a short word from our sponsors.
[02:08] This episode is brought to you by Sanity.
[02:11] Your website is the heart of your growth engine.
[02:13] For that engine to drive big results, you need to be able to move super fast,
[02:17] ship new content, experiment, learn and iterate.
[02:20] But most content management systems just aren't built for this.
[02:23] Your content teams wrestle with rigid interfaces as they build new pages.
[02:27] You spend endless time copying and pasting across pages and recreating content for other channels and applications.
[02:33] And their ideas for new experiments are squashed when developers can't build them within the constraints of outdated tech.
