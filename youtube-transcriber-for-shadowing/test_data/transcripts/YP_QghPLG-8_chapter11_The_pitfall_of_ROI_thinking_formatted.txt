I love that visual of a bandaid falling off. That's what we've all seen. This is a good segue to our fifth and final big idea, maybe the most mind-bending of all your ideas that I want to talk about. And it's about prioritization. You make this really interesting point that instead of thinking about the highest ROI work you should be doing, which is how I've always thought about it, how I think most PMs think about prioritization, your point is you should think about it from a minimizing opportunity cost perspective versus ROI perspective. I'm excited to hear your take on this and where this idea came from.

Yeah, I think I learned this by kind of just observing Patrick at Stripe, particularly over the last couple of years that I was there. I kind of encapsulated what I learned and observed in this tweet, which is when you are in a high leverage role, you should stop doing work that simply provides a positive return on investment, ROI. You should start focusing on work that minimizes opportunity cost. What drives that is the observation that in a high leverage role, like product management, founders, engineering leaders, design leaders, and designers, there will be hundreds of things that you can do that will provide a positive ROI. 

What is positive ROI? It's simply that the value created is greater than the value of your time. Essentially, that will ensure positive ROI, right? More than zero. The problem is you should not be doing most of these things. The reason this kind of ROI mindset is suboptimal and perhaps even harmful in high leverage roles is that the formula for ROI is value created minus cost of your time divided by the cost of your time. The cost of your time is in the denominator. For simplicity, let's just call it time taken. 

When the time taken to do something is in the denominator, whether at an individual level or at a team level, what we end up doing to get high ROI on our work is we try to decrease the denominator. When it's a ratio and you decrease the denominator, the value of the ratio grows. So how do you decrease the denominator in this case? Where time is the denominator, you start working on things that take less time. You begin prioritizing the quick wins. Quick wins are very popular in any team meeting or sprint meeting. 

I don't have anything against quick wins, but the problem is we just fill up our plate with them. While that may be fine in most cases, in high leverage roles, you miss the upside and the opportunity that you could have gained by focusing on other things. Now, let's take opportunity costs. How do you calculate opportunity costs? Opportunity cost is simply the value of the optimal option minus the value of the chosen option. The difference between what could have been the optimal option to pick and the option you did pick is the opportunity cost. 

You need to minimize the opportunity cost, meaning you need to be working on the optimal things. When we reprogram ourselves to think in terms of opportunity cost, we are no longer thinking, "Oh, is this a good use of my time?" Instead, you are thinking, "Is this the best use of my time?" It's a subtle but profound shift in our thinking. When we think about opportunity cost, we will pick certain things that we would have never picked if we just had the ROI mindset. This applies equally at the level of individuals and the work we decide to do on a day-to-day basis, as well as the work we do with our teams and the things we prioritize.

Is there an example that comes to mind of when you did this or maybe did it the wrong way that inspired this idea? Or is this just a broad lesson you've learned over time? 

Oh, I mean, I saw that all the time in the work I did at pretty much every company. I've been guilty of this myself. Typically, the type of situation where I have seen this as an example is when you are trying to prioritize the next quarter. There are five sure things you can do that will have a small to medium impact, and it's very clear. Then there are two ambiguous things that you could do that perhaps deep down, you know you should pursue, but you don't end up picking them because you're satisfying yourself by observing, "Oh, each of these is positive ROI." 

Each of these five things that we can do are very well defined as positive ROI, so you don't touch those two things. It could be that one of those things could meaningfully change the trajectory of your business. Doing that requires more work to figure it out, to flesh it out. But we convince ourselves that positive ROI is great, and so we make ourselves busy. I've seen other teams do this, and certainly, when I sit down with PMs or even founders, I find that there is this gravitation towards tasks that simply provide positive ROI. 

It shows up most often in our planning. Again, I'm not against quick wins or things that provide positive ROI, but I always want to check what are some big opportunities that we are not paying attention to by default. Under what scenarios can we start chasing that? When I started working on Stripe Connect, which is a major product for Stripe and a large business for Stripe, there was a time when I noticed the team was working on a lot of positive ROI things. 

I came in and simply instigated, "Hey, how about we work on this big scary project?" I was hearing from customers that there is some need, and I had the instinct that this need is going to grow over time, being able to manage marketplace payments in a more flexible way. We wouldn't have looked at it if we were just focused on positive ROI. But as we started looking at it, we realized, "Oh, yes, this is a huge opportunity." We were able to pursue it because we shifted the mindset from just positive ROI to minimizing opportunity cost.
