============================================================

I'm guessing a lot of founders ask for your advice on raising money, getting started, having gone through so much rejection early on. What’s your general advice to folks that are having a hard time fundraising? I mean, I can only go on my experience, but I think it's sort of like the dark tunnel analogy. Oh, chaos to clarity. Let's go with that one. It's a slightly friendlier analogy. 

I think just taking the rejection and turning it into things that you can control. So I can control my pitch deck. I can control the number of people I'm speaking to. I just spoke to literally everyone. Continuing to use it to refine it rather than taking it as a personal rejection is really important. Think about how you can improve and how you can help someone to understand it. Some people are never going to understand it. I remember pitching an investor who had the Lean Startup book behind them while I was pitching. They were never going to like Canva because we were not the Lean Startup; that was not the way we were approaching it whatsoever. 

There are some people that are just never going to like you, and that’s okay. It’s important to find some people that do like what you’re trying to say and do, and kind of find your tribe. As an investor, this is really interesting to hear because it tells you there are companies like Canva out there that everyone’s turning down. A hundred investors passed on that, and you might still be able to invest in them. 

Talking about your growth as a leader, if you compared Melanie of today to Melanie of 12 or 13 years ago when you were just starting Canva, what would you say is most different in terms of leadership? I don’t really know. Probably if you asked other people around me, they’d be more observant. It’s funny because there are some things that I think I need to change, and then I realize that I’m going into it the same as some other company. Sometimes we even try that for a while, and then we try it out and think, “That didn’t really work for us.” 

It’s kind of like building a house; you want every brick in the house to match. If you go and try to take some bricks from someone else’s house and stick them in yours, it’s probably not going to look very matched. So trying to find things that are authentic to us and everything that’s come before it is just that constant thing. Each stage of scale of the company requires us to give away hats. In the very early days, we were just a few of us, or just two of us in fusion, then three of us, just a tiny group. You wear a hundred hats, and then you have to be able to give away those hats to other people who can do that way better than yourself. 

I’m sure there are a few skills I would have had to develop over the last decade to be able to give away those hats. But yeah, I think there are a lot of things we’ve had to do and double down on that were more authentic to the way we did it in the early days, actually. 

I love that story. I think, again, anyone working at a company that has gone through a lot of growth has experienced when people from other companies come in and say, “Here’s how we did it at this company.” Is there an example of something that this company brought in that people from this company thought we should do, and we tried but it didn’t work? 

I’m not going to give specific examples, but it’s happened so many times. Maybe that’s probably in answer to your other question. We didn’t do things our way because that was the only way we knew. There were many times over the years when we didn’t have confidence in how we were doing things. We’d think, “Oh, they’ve done it at a big company that’s bigger than ours. Let’s go do that.” That hasn’t always worked out so well for us. 

So yeah, I think confidence in how we take what is authentic to us and do it at the next level of scale is a constant work in progress. Systems break and need to be reinvented, but also reimagined for that next layer of scale rather than trying to get something off the shelf from another company. 

And it helps that you’re in Australia, away from the Bay Area and where all these other big companies are, allowing you to do it your own way.
