============================================================

[00:00] Final question when someone joins a Airbnb, there's a very long-standing tradition of sharing a fun fact about yourself
[00:06] It might be the longest standing tradition
[00:08] It's always tough on the spot, but I'm curious Brian if there's a fun fact that you want to share about yourself
[00:13] That maybe people don't already know. Yeah, so a fun fact about me is that I actually spent most of my life as an artist
[00:21] You know when I was five years old
[00:24] I remember my parents I take me to Norman Rockwell Museum and I would sit in front of you know his beautiful illustrations
[00:31] They're really painting such to say they shouldn't even call them illustrations
[00:34] And I would try to reproduce them and I got obsessive with art
[00:39] I remember when I was maybe in elementary school
[00:42] I asked Santa for poorly designed Christmas toys so I could redesign them
[00:47] When I got so the older one of my friends I went to his house
[00:50] I'm gonna say I was like eight or nine years old and his dad was basically like
[00:55] Redoing his deck, but his dad decided to design it himself. I think maybe use an architect
[00:59] So we had this giant dining room table and he had like this vellum paper
[01:03] And he had a t-square and a drawing triangle and a protractor and I just they're cool
[01:08] They were really cool looking tools and they were basically floor plans and architectural drawings
[01:12] So I got into architectural and landscape design when I was like eight or nine and that led to my interest in
[01:18] Architecture I went to RPI was a freshman of high school to do like a pre-college program
[01:26] Then I got into like more and more drawing and figure drawing then I got to a film and animation
[01:32] Then I got involved in environmental design
[01:36] I realized that if you buy stock in a company you could get these cool glossy annual reports
[01:41] This is kind of when the internet was kind of like they send and people still mail the annual reports
[01:45] As I got my dad to buy a few shares at Disney stock
[01:49] And I got these renderings and the end report of theme parks
[01:52] and I started like drawing like and designing like theme parks and communities and I
[01:59] Was at this private school for actually for hockey because I had its parallel life
[02:04] whereas playing ice hockey and I thought I was gonna play college hockey my dad was really into it
[02:10] I was really into it and I had a art teacher in high school at this military school. That's another fun fact
[02:16] I basically went to a military high school Wow did not know that and at this military sports Academy kind of oriented high school
[02:22] I had the same art teacher from eighth grade to 11th grade and
[02:27] That's not a good thing by the I don't see this good thing because I was not diversifying my skills
[02:32] And so I leave this high school
[02:34] Because I wanted to pursue different interests than hockey and I transferred to my public high school
[02:41] late my junior year and imagine like transferring to a new public high school late junior year and I meet
[02:48] My art teacher who changes my life
[02:50] Her name is miss Williams
[02:53] And she sees my artwork and by the way my mom was nervous
[02:59] About me becoming an artist she said she sell me
[03:02] I chose a job for the love and I paid them I got paid no money
[03:05] She used to choose a job that pays a lot of money and I said to my mom one day
[03:08] I was going to be an artist should oh my god. You chose the only job
[03:11] We're gonna pay less than a social worker
[03:12] So I think my parents, you know, they were supportive of me going to art
[03:16] But they were very nervous and then miss Williams told my mom
[03:18] She said don't worry. He's gonna be a famous artist one day
[03:21] I wasn't going to become a famous artist
[03:23] But what that did is I think it gave everyone the confidence for me to pursue art
[03:28] I ended up being one of the a winner
[03:31] there were multiple winners of a national art competition and I had my artwork displayed in the rotunda gallery
[03:37] That then led to me getting a scholarship at the Rhode Island School of Design
[03:41] Where I end up going to RISD. It's like, you know, it's kind of like it's kind of like MIT for design or whatever
[03:47] It's like a it's a it's prestige is art and design school
[03:50] But I got to RISD and I realized I was born a hundred years too late for what I wanted to do
[03:56] Which is you know draw and paint and I felt like at that point photography and now AI generated art
[04:02] But certainly even back then photography was replacing a lot of the skills that like that I need that that I had
[04:09] And that's when I was in my fresh beer of college. I learned about a funk field called industrial design
[04:16] They said industrial design is the design of everything from a toothbrush to a spaceship and everything in between
