============================================================

[00:00] If someone is listening and they're not a PM, and they are not convinced to not get
[00:05] into product management, they still want to become a PM, what is your best advice for
[00:09] someone that is trying to get into product management of how to actually break into product
[00:12] management?
[00:13] I thought about this one a lot and I consulted the Slack Workspace team because it's been
[00:21] a long time since I tried to get into product and so I didn't know what was going
[00:25] on these days because it's hard and I hadn't, I didn't, I don't know if things have
[00:29] changed.
[00:30] You know, I went to business school and that's how I got in.
[00:33] There was a program that took MBA students.
[00:37] I think there are some entry-level programs out there at big tech companies.
[00:40] If you can get them, I think they're really hard to get because they're very few and
[00:43] far between and so the most common two paths that I've seen are people who
[00:47] switch laterally within a company, again challenging but can be done, or people
[00:52] who join startups.
[00:53] So now I was at my last startup, I did hire someone who was coming out of business
[00:56] school who hadn't been into product into a PM role and I can't say I wouldn't do it
[01:04] because it was awesome and she was amazing but it takes a lot of work.
[01:07] The reason why people don't do it is because as a manager it takes a lot of
[01:09] work because there's so much that these people need to learn and what we ended
[01:13] up doing is she and I spent four months working together in a WeWork in person to
[01:18] help her on board really quickly into the role which was so rewarding and I loved
[01:23] every second of it and I wish I could do that again and again and again but to
[01:29] get that she basically just hounded me, Christine, if you're listening, you
[01:33] emailed me a lot, we talked a lot and we waited till the time was right and
[01:37] then you finally convinced me to do it so I don't know, I don't know if
[01:41] there's a reliable, if there's a reliable path that I can say like this
[01:45] is what my advice would be other than try a startup, network, see what you can do.
[01:50] And you've made at this point elsewhere which I think is an additional key piece
[01:55] is once you have a PM title on your resume everything gets easier because
[01:58] as a hiring manager I'm just like I look at a resume like oh they've never
[02:01] been a PM, I'm not, this isn't the role, it's like rarely that
[02:06] does someone want someone that's never been a PM.
[02:08] Yeah and I tell people, I do unsurprisingly talk to lots of
[02:13] people who either are in product or want to be in product and that's one of
[02:16] the things I always tell them because they're, you know, if they're deciding
[02:18] between roles and they have an opportunity to do something and my advice
[02:22] is always if you can get someone to stamp you with the product manager
[02:26] role, take it because to your point it's what we screen on, it's for
[02:31] better or worse it's just like you just have to, you have to get that
[02:34] first job and then once you get that first job it all gets easier because
[02:37] you can get in and then you can talk about your experience because then
[02:40] the second question I have is what have you shipped, right?
[02:42] So it's like have you been a PM before?
[02:44] What have you shipped?
[02:45] And it's fascinating how quickly people can't answer that question
[02:49] and the people who can are always several steps ahead of the people.
