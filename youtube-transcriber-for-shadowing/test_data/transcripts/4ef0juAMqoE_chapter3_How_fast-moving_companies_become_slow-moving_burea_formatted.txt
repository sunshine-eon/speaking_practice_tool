Because Silicon Valley often treats design as a service organization, design is seen as something that catches issues before products go out the door. It is not typically integrated into the development process. This approach is detrimental not only to design but also to product managers and engineers, as we all aim to build the best products possible.

One day, you might wake up and notice a variety of phenomena occurring within a large company. Here are some characteristics you might observe. First, different groups may be operating on slightly different technical stacks, which creates a significant problem. Additionally, there may be a considerable amount of technical debt. The next issue arises from the dependencies between teams. For instance, if five teams are moving in different directions but all require a payment platform, the teams that everyone depends on can become overwhelmed, much like a deli with a long line of customers waiting for service. Eventually, these teams may reach a breaking point.

As a result, teams that rely on others may decide to take matters into their own hands, saying, "Give me the resources, and I'll build this group myself." Instead of collaborating with marketing to create a campaign or leverage a service, they start establishing their own marketing departments and groups. This leads to the formation of separate divisions, which is where division originates. Once divisions are established, their success is tied to their priority within the organization, necessitating advocacy for their own interests.

With dependencies in place, individuals must persuade others by building relationships. Those who excel at relationship-building are often the ones who secure the most resources, which can foster a political environment within the company. As politics take root, divisions become more pronounced, leading to an increase in bureaucracy. This bureaucracy makes it challenging to understand who is doing what, as people begin to move in different directions, resulting in a lack of accountability.

When accountability wanes, individuals may feel that their contributions do not matter, which breeds complacency. Consequently, a fast-growing company can devolve into a sluggish bureaucracy. This is a common trajectory. You may find that a company has executed ten marketing efforts, yet no customers are aware of any of them. Despite having thousands of engineers who have shipped numerous products, customers may struggle to identify a single offering.

Moreover, marketing and engineering teams often fail to communicate effectively. It’s not that they dislike each other; rather, they exist in entirely different universes. I've always maintained that a simple heuristic for assessing the health of an organization is the proximity of engineering and marketing. In many companies, marketing functions like waitstaff, while engineers are akin to chefs who may yell at the waiters. However, the waitstaff interact with customers daily and understand how to sell products. Therefore, it is crucial for these teams to work closely together, with engineers considering how to communicate about the products they are building. This disconnect is the core problem we face.
