============================================================

[00:00] Is there like a, like is it almost like you want to be, learn the Eng Manager skill of
[00:05] overseeing engineers versus like the actual engineering skill, or do you think it's still
[00:10] going to be really important to learn how to code and be really good at that?
[00:14] I mean, doing a bit of everything being in general is I think much more important than
[00:19] it used to be.
[00:20] And the, if I'm putting it together a product team today, I would re-obsess about getting
[00:26] as much of as many skill sets as possible for each person I hire.
[00:33] They should know how architecting a system works preferably.
[00:38] They should know the sign, they should know, they should have product taste, they should
[00:41] know how to talk to users.
[00:43] I think everyone should be able to know, should know a bit of that, what are that preferably.
[00:48] Easier said than done.
[00:49] It's hard to find people that know all these things.
[00:51] So let's segue to hiring and how you hire.
[00:54] How many people do you have at this point?
[00:56] Is that something you share?
[00:57] Yeah, now we're at 18.
[00:59] 18, okay, wow, so I love that you, it sounded like you're about to say, oh, we have 100
[01:05] people now.
[01:06] 18, okay, so you went from 15 to 18, okay, great.
[01:10] So what do you look for when you're hiring people?
[01:12] The way I saw you describe it on Twitter is you look for cracked engineers, the
[01:16] best crack team in Europe, things like that.
[01:18] I guess just specifically what are you looking for when you're hiring?
[01:21] I think the most important thing is that people care a lot and they're not just like,
[01:28] oh, I'm here for a job, I'm here for being a passenger on this journey, but everyone
[01:33] should really care about the product, the users and care a ton about the team, how the
[01:39] team works together and that you're always contributing to making the team work more
[01:45] productively together and that care or preferably obsession gets you very long ways.
[01:54] And then you do often want to have absolute superpower in some dimension to be able to
[02:03] understand and do as many things as possible, like have this generalist brain that quickly
[02:08] learns any skill, but be super, super good in one dimension.
[02:13] For us, that's mostly cramming as much out of AI, out of the large language models and
[02:19] understanding the entire parameter space of what you can change to make our product perform
[02:27] better.
[02:28] So how do you actually test for these things?
[02:31] Some of these things describe everything everyone's looking for, like they care about the user,
[02:34] they want to collaborate well, just like when you're, because you have 18 people
[02:39] building in a company that's growing more than a million a hour every week, like that's
[02:42] an absurd scale and the people you've found are clearly world class and I think a lot
[02:50] of people are going to like want to hire the type of people you're hiring.
[02:53] So when you're actually interviewing, how do you suss out some of these things like
[02:57] their AI cramming skills, their team building collaboration, what do you actually do?
[03:02] I ask people what they've done before and these people that I'm describing,
[03:08] they have often done something where they care a lot about what they've done before and
[03:14] they dig into details about the technical things that they did and then we do the normal
[03:21] thing of showing a very hard problem that is a bit unorthodox that someone hasn't
[03:26] seen before preferably and see how they think and reason through that.
[03:32] Something that I think is more uncommon is that we do, I pretty much always have people
[03:38] join the work simulation for at least a day, often over four weeks.
[03:43] Awesome. Okay, so work trial, that's awesome. So basically they work with the team for at
[03:48] least a day, you said like sometimes a week. Yeah. And I love this point you made about
[03:54] they show, they cared deeply about something they previously worked on and you look for
[04:00] just like obsession with the thing that they built last or something they worked on.
[04:05] Like what percentage are engineers of these 18?
[04:09] So 12 at least, write code at least four times.
[04:15] 12 out of 18, okay, cool. When we were setting up, you're like, oh, our engineers creating
[04:20] content now. I think that's a cool example of how people do a lot of different things.
[04:26] Yeah. Also, okay, so I have your job posting that you shared once of like
[04:31] the actual job description. I'm going to read a few lines from it. It's very inspired by
[04:35] Shackleton, right? Would you agree? Cool. I love it. By the way, did you write this or did
[04:40] you have AI write this job description where you like create an engineering job description?
[04:44] In fact, let me read it to you. I don't even know, you may not know whatever you're
[04:47] referring to. I'll read a few lines here. Long hours, high pace,
[04:51] candidates must thrive under a high urgency under AGI timelines approaching.
[04:57] Difficult mission ahead, honor and recognition in case of success, those seeking comfortable work
[05:02] need not apply. And then there's a few other things, collaboration with other exceptional
[05:06] minds, purpose larger than any normal engineering role, generous share in the venture success.
[05:12] Amazing. Thank you. Thoughts? Yeah, so I did get some help with the formatting of this,
[05:19] but then I was mostly me doing the exact tracing of the different sentences.
[05:25] So good. And I love that, you know, to some people, it's going to be like,
[05:29] holy shit, I'm not signing up for this. But to a lot of people, the people you want is like,
[05:33] yes, this is exactly what I want to be doing.
[05:36] Correct. Amazing. There.
[05:38] Okay, cool. So it feels like one of the elements of hiring here is create a really good filter
[05:44] to be clear about just how intense this is so that the people that want that are the ones drawn to you.
