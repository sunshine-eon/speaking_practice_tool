============================================================

[00:00] Okay. And then you're also, you're in Sweden, fastest growing startup in Europe ever. Thoughts
[00:08] on building in Europe slash Sweden versus the US slash San Francisco.
[00:12] Yeah. So this ambition level that you're talking about in the job is more uncommon
[00:19] in Sweden. And I think that is the biggest unlock that someone like me who sees that
[00:27] this is the like the time in human history when you have the most impact per worked hour. And
[00:36] that's why we have to be super ambitious, like just up the ambition level. And then we
[00:39] can maybe retire and have AI take care of most things in society. And inspiring people
[00:49] to be this ambitious in a place where the average ambition is lower. But the talent
[00:56] the raw talent is much more available is a great recipe. I think that's a great recipe. So
[01:04] and that's what I think it is some kind of advantage there. It's a bit of a double edged
[01:09] sordor, but it's some kind of advantage. So I'm hearing is like there's incredible
[01:16] people in Europe. They're just not, they're harder to find in what I'm hearing is like
[01:21] the key is how do you suss them out and get them to want to talk to you?
[01:27] Yeah, most people in Europe, they haven't thought that all do going on an extremely ambitious
[01:33] mission is what I want to do. So that's figuring out who those are is a big part of it.
