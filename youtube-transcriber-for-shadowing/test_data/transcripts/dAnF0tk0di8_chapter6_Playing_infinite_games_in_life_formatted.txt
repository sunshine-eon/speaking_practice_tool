You also have no investors. You have no board. You have no plans to go public. You have no plans to sell the business. Right. There's this book—I don't know if you've read it—called "Finite and Infinite Games." 

No, I haven't done that. 

Okay. I think you would love it. The whole premise of this book is quite interesting. It's a terse, somewhat tricky philosophical book, but it's very short. It espouses the idea that you want to be playing infinite games to be happy in life—games that never end. Versus games like, "I'm going to build a business and sell it," or "I'm going to go public; that's my goal." 

You get the most joy out of things that never end, like building great relationships or a company that you want to keep working on forever. I like that. And you know, it's interesting because I've always thought of my career this way. When I got my first job at 13, I worked in a grocery store for a bit and then in a shoe store. 

After that, maybe when I was 15, I got a reseller's license. This was way back in the day. There was a company called Ingram Micro, which had this huge thick catalog of electronics equipment. If you had a reseller's license, you could buy these things at wholesale prices and then sell them to my friends at retail, which was almost 2x the wholesale price. 

Even though I'm not selling electronics equipment today—I'm selling software instead—I feel like I have the exact same job as I did when I was 15. This is a long continuum of finding stuff that I like. In this case today, it's building things that I like and selling them to like-minded people who also find them useful or enjoy those things too. 

So whether it's software, electronics, stereo equipment, or music organizing databases, whatever it is, it's all the same to me. I just want to keep doing it. This is my day job. 

I think the other interesting aspect of my entrepreneurship is that sometimes there's a sense that you can either get a job or be an entrepreneur. Well, being an entrepreneur is a job. I want this to be my job. I want to create the company that I want to work at, and I want to keep doing this job for as long as I can—as long as I'm useful, I'm good at it, and I enjoy it. 

The idea of getting in bed with an investment that would say, "In five years, you have to stop doing what you're doing. You might get a big paycheck, but you have to stop," has no appeal to me at all. I'd rather just keep doing the thing that I'm enjoying for as long as I can continue to make it work. 

What's cool about having a company like ours, which is an independent business, is that we don't have to ask anyone for permission. No one can tell us no, and we can turn this into anything we want. It's a vehicle more so than just a software business—though that is, of course, what it is—but it could be something else as well. 

There are no limits to what it could be, and that's a fun way to go through life too. It’s like this all-terrain vehicle that can go anywhere—on-road, off-road, whatever—and you can kind of get anywhere you need to go. That's what's really quite fun about this kind of journey.
