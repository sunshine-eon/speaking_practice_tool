Chapter 10: Why founders should be “in the details”
Video: Brian Chesky’s new playbook
Time: 24:51 - 30:15
============================================================

[00:00] Details.
[00:00] And by the way, Lenny, here's the funny thing before the crisis, a lot of people
[00:04] felt like I was too involved in different areas.
[00:07] Once the crisis happened, guess what happened?
[00:09] People are like, what do we do?
[00:10] We need you more involved.
[00:12] And so I got more involved.
[00:14] And when I got involved, I made the following changes.
[00:17] The first thing I did is I took like, I said, everything we're doing has to be
[00:21] written down and put into Google, Google, like a Google sheet.
[00:24] It turns out people couldn't even write down everything they were doing.
[00:28] I remember one person told me, you think we're doing too many things for me to
[00:32] every be able to document.
[00:34] I'm like, what?
[00:36] But anyways, we eventually got everyone to write everything down.
[00:38] And I said, okay, we can do about 20% of these things.
[00:41] And so if everyone says, Oh, I might be simple, I'm only doing three things.
[00:45] Yes, but you're one of like a thousand people.
[00:47] So actually we're doing 3000 things.
[00:48] So instead of one team doing three things, three teams should do one thing.
[00:52] So we totally cut down the number of projects.
[00:55] We removed layers of management.
[00:56] I wanted to be as few layers as possible from leaders of team.
[01:00] We went to a functional model.
[01:02] We went back to a startup.
[01:03] So we said, we're not going to have divisional leaders.
[01:05] We're going to have design engineering product and which turned to product
[01:09] marketing and marketing and communications and sales and operations.
[01:12] All the functions of startup.
[01:14] I said, we're going to have fewer employees.
[01:16] We're going to have fewer, more senior people.
[01:18] There's a great saying that the best way to slow project down is add more people to it.
[01:21] And so we felt like very few employees.
[01:24] We have fewer than 7,000 employees today as a relative comparison.
[01:28] I think Uber has 30,000 and that's not to say they're big.
[01:32] It's just say that's how small we are.
[01:34] And we've really benefited from having not a lot of employees.
[01:37] So we had, we made sure that every executive was an expert in their functional domain.
[01:42] So you know how there's a lot of engineering managers that aren't that technical
[01:45] or maybe not a lot, but they're, they exist or there's designers, but there's
[01:49] design leaders who lead the people.
[01:52] A design leaders job should be managing the design first, the people second.
[01:58] That's what Johnny did or like they're interchangeable.
[02:01] I could never imagine Johnny of Apple just being a manager of people.
[02:05] He was looking and designing the work with the team.
[02:09] How do you manage the people without managing their work?
[02:12] How do you give them development if you're not in the details with them on the work?
[02:16] So the same thing is true.
[02:17] So people had to be experts.
[02:18] Everyone had to be an expert.
[02:20] I stopped pushing decision making down.
[02:22] I pulled it in.
[02:24] I created one shared consciousness.
[02:25] And I said the top 30, 40 people in company are going to have one continuous
[02:29] conversation.
[02:30] Metrics are going to be subordinate to the calendar.
[02:33] So we're going to have a roadmap.
[02:34] It's going to be a two year roadmap.
[02:36] We'll update the roadmap literally every month.
[02:38] People may wonder, well, like, what if the world changes yet changes every day?
[02:42] So the roadmaps, something where the next month doesn't change, but two years out,
[02:46] it changes, it's a rolling roadmap.
[02:48] And by the way, if Ukraine gets invaded and you want to like provide housing
[02:51] for refugees, you can still pivot people and adapt very quickly.
[02:54] We house 120,000, 20,000 refugees.
[02:57] So you still keep a reserve of resources to be able to pivot and do things
[03:01] because there's always unexpected events.
[03:03] I created this new function called product marketing.
[03:06] We basically describe what that is.
[03:08] I need the group much smaller.
[03:10] I took a lot of product managers.
[03:12] I reassigned as program managers.
[03:14] I had many of them trained and actual program manager because their roles got
[03:17] much bigger.
[03:19] Program management Airbnb is a high status job.
[03:21] A lot of companies, it's like a coordination job.
[03:24] And Airbnb, we said, because we're going to do launches, it's high status.
[03:27] We said, we're going to do two launches a year and you can't ship
[03:30] something unless it's on the roadmap.
[03:32] So every single thing in the company, with the exception of some
[03:34] infrastructure projects, have to be on the roadmap.
[03:38] And then I'm going to review all the work.
[03:40] And so we create the CEO review schedule where I said, I'm getting back in the
[03:43] fall from the project and I'm going to design, I'm going to review all the
[03:46] product and all the marketing.
[03:48] So every project I would do review every week, every two weeks, every four weeks,
[03:52] every eight weeks, every 12 weeks, there'd be a cadence.
[03:55] And then I had a head program manager that would score all the projects,
[03:59] either they're green, yellow, or red, being they're on track or not on track to
[04:03] ship, whether we thought there were work.
[04:05] We don't know until after we ship it, but I use the reviews of the work every
[04:09] single week.
[04:10] And the reason there's not a lot of bureaucracy and the reason you don't
[04:14] need any influence at Airbnb is I'd review the work.
[04:17] And if something wasn't happening, then I would like stop the meeting and say,
[04:21] why isn't this happening?
[04:23] And like, we would all get together.
[04:25] And so you couldn't have a situation where like a team wouldn't collaborate.
[04:28] And so it would be like, I could then feel the work of an individual engineer.
[04:34] Cause imagine it's like we're a car company and I, I see the car prototype every week.
[04:39] And I noticed there's a, there's a, there's a something about the tire is off.
[04:44] Now I can identify the individual person who was blocked.
[04:49] So every week I would see, I would try to see the equivalent of at least a
[04:54] semi assembly of the entire new product we were working on, which allowed me to
[04:58] identify with teams, the different bottlenecks happening in the company.
[05:03] And the reviews were the thing that allowed us to dictate the pace.
[05:08] And so because we had annual week over all these reviews, I didn't need to mandate
[05:13] we're going back to an office.
[05:14] I didn't really care where they worked because I could track how well they were
[05:17] working because of the review cycle.
[05:20] I, it's, so these were, these were like some of the changes that we made.
