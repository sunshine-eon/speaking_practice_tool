============================================================

[00:00] One thread I'm pulling out of a few of your stories so far is you often come back to this
[00:04] like full stack approach to many models.
[00:07] So you talked about how PM is like an influencer, but also they're influencing users.
[00:11] It's a cool way of thinking about it with this working backwards process.
[00:15] You can use it to think about the full stack of launch, not just what features you're
[00:19] going to build.
[00:20] I know you also have some strong opinions about product managers and they should be
[00:23] much more full stack than most PMs.
[00:26] Does that ring a bell?
[00:27] And if so, can you talk about that?
[00:29] Yes.
[00:30] No, I think it's the same thread that is connecting the first and the second.
[00:34] I think product managers have to own outcomes and not only features and parts of the problem,
[00:42] but they will own some parts of the problem fully.
[00:45] But if they need to work with everybody to make sure that eventual product that they
[00:50] launch is successful and not only successful from the point of view of, hey, we launched
[00:55] something that works for users, et cetera, that's not the definition of success.
[00:59] Did it work in the way that it really changed the behavior of the kind of user that we wanted
[01:04] to achieve a business outcome that will build a capability that is important for us?
[01:09] All of those things combined will not happen if the product manager is only thinking about
[01:13] their part.
[01:14] So they have to think about external users.
[01:17] They have to think about competition.
[01:19] They have to think about other product managers and product leaders about engineering,
[01:22] about marketing, and so on, whether it's such a diverse field, unless you really
[01:27] and I'm not saying you need to be an authority of that, unless either you are very, very good
[01:32] at that or you have built partnerships and have run your ideas or product through those
[01:37] people and gotten weighted from them and finally made a decision around that part.
[01:42] I don't think you'll be very successful.
[01:44] So in my opinion, the full stack product managers are the ones who are going to be more
[01:47] successful rather than product managers who are doing very good at one particular area
[01:53] only.
[01:54] So this one book, which is range, I'm sure like you may have heard about it, right?
[02:00] Even the first chapter, what they talk about is they take two examples.
[02:04] One is the example of Roger Federer.
[02:07] So with Roger Federer, for example, I think I'll just continue that.
[02:10] That till 18, he played like a bunch of racquet sports and this wasn't even tennis.
[02:17] But then you bring in ideas from one racquet sport to the other and second to
[02:22] the third and so on, so forth.
[02:23] And now you have such a range of ideas that you can connect a lot more dots and
[02:26] actually ship it.
[02:27] I think that's a better playbook for being more successful in product.
[02:32] I was just watching a documentary on, I think it was called Greatness and Ed Wayne Gretzky.
[02:36] And he had exactly the same experience actually when he was young.
[02:39] He played hockey just during winter times and during summer, he played other sports
[02:43] and hockey was just like a sport.
[02:46] One sport he played and then eventually he started to focus on it and they talked
[02:49] about how people that play different sports in their childhood actually ended up
[02:52] being much better than one sport they chose.
