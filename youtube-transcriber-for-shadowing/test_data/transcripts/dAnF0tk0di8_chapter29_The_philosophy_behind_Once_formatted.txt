============================================================

And then, could you talk about the first thing you're launching or is that not out? 

Yeah, sure. The first product we're going to be launching is basically an old product that we made way, way, way back when. So years and years and years ago, in 2006, we launched a product called Campfire, which was a group chat tool. How could you not remember Campfire? Some people are 22 and they don't know, understandably so. But if you've been around, maybe you remember Campfire, which was a group chat tool, which is, I think, like eight years before Slack came out or something like that. 

So it was really, really hard to get people to even understand what this thing was. A lot of people kind of didn't get it. And then Slack came out, of course, and sort of steamrolled it and really executed beautifully and did a great job. But chat has become a commodity. There are a million ways of chatting with people now. In the business realm, they're all still quite expensive, and they're all month to month to month. You've got Slack, you've got Teams, and you've got a few others. 

And it's like, you know what? There are some open-source alternatives, by the way, that are freer or cheap. But we want to put something back out there. So we're going to relaunch Campfire under the Once brand. You'll pay for it once, you'll install it on your own servers, and you'll run it. It'll do 90 percent of the things that you want to do every day in these other chat tools and do them very, very well and very, very simply and very, very easily. We think it's going to be really interesting. 

By the way, the other thing we're thinking about with these Once products, which is interesting to get to this alternative point of view, is that these don't necessarily need to replace things. They can be in addition to what you already have. You might still run Slack at your company, but you want a backup for when Slack goes down, or you want a special air-gapped chat for your executive team that cannot be leaked by another company where you're hosting data or having other people involved that might have access to it by accident. 

You can run things and have different tools doing similar things, but for different groups in different contexts. Now, you probably wouldn't want to pay month to month for a backup system when something almost never goes down. But if you only have to pay for it once, it might be really appealing—like an insurance policy you pay for once and just have in your back pocket, right? 

The other thing we're doing with Once products is that you get the code. If you're a product team and you're curious to see how this product was built, we've gone to great lengths to make it exceptionally well built for this purpose. This is essentially a book on how to build this kind of thing really, really well on the CSS, HTML, and Ruby on Rails side, for example. You'll get all the code, and you can look at it, modify it, play with it, and tweak it. You can't resell it—there's certain licensing—but it's yours. 

So if you want to change the layout, go ahead. If you want to add some features, go ahead. If you want to mess around, go ahead. It's yours. That's another thing that's really novel. You don't get that in subscription software. So there's a lot of things going on that we're trying. 

There's some other really cool stuff. I'll tell you one more quick thing about it: we're trying to make this first prompt especially have as few words as possible—maybe like 30 words. We're picking tools and categories that people already know how to use, and we're trying to keep as many words out of this as possible. So it's essentially instantly available for the entire world. It doesn't have to be localized; it's just like universal software. 

When we do have a word, we're going to have a panel that shows that translation in a bunch of different languages. It's not like you install this pack or that pack. You can hit this because different people in the world work in different countries. We have people in different countries that work for us. I don't want to just have the Indian version because people in India might also have people that work in Brazil and they need the Portuguese version. 

So you can see all the different languages for certain words when we use them, which is a really novel thing. We're kind of playing with this whole concept; these kinds of tools give us a chance to explore new realms and ideas that we couldn't do with SaaS. This is one of the reasons I'm excited again. There's some novelty, some new explorations, and we're able to do things that we couldn't do in other places. 

So there's an excitement building around this creative exploration again, and that's really firing us up. It's clear how you're excited about this. Like you're saying how you thought you'd be happy just building Basecamp for the rest of your life. There's a pull here to try something totally new and different. Also, the domain is awesome—that was fun. And we're still going to do Basecamp. 

So we're still doing SaaS. I still believe in SaaS. This is not going to replace SaaS, but there should be an alternative. People should be able to buy what they need versus rent what they need. I think this is going to be an interesting experiment because this is how we started with software. Then SaaS came, and everyone loved this idea: I don't have to worry about anything. I'm just going to pay you monthly, and you take care of maintenance, hosting, and keep updating me with better features. 

So I think it'll be interesting to see if we miss something leaving that world. One clarifying question for updates: do you buy yearly, kind of like a new Campfire every year, or how does that work? 

Yeah, so the plan is that let's say you buy Campfire 1.0. This is kind of the way software used to work. It's the same sort of approach, which is like you'll get all the 1.x updates for free. You'll be able to decide if you want to update yours or not. We'll say, "Hey, there's a 1.1 out, and here are the new things." You get to decide if you want to download that and update yours or not. 

So you can stick with 1.0 if you want, or you can skip a version or whatever you want to do. When we get to version 2.0, there'd probably be—you'd probably have to buy it again. But we probably have a discounted upgrade rate. That's totally optional. I don't know if we'll ever even get there; we might not need to. But we're leaving that door open that, you know, if there's a radically new version that we had to sync another six or eight months into or something, it feels right to say you'll need to upgrade. Maybe you get half off because you're a previous customer or something like that. 

So we don't know, but that's the plan. I think it's also important for people to remember your target is not to replace Slack at big tech companies. Your market is the Fortune 5 million, as you described. First of all, we don't have a sales team, so it's self-service. It'll always be if some big, huge company looks at their Slack bill and sees they're paying 1.2 million a year for this, they might think, "Wait a second. I can pay less than a thousand bucks once for this. Maybe that's worth having." 

Or maybe, even if we don't use it, it's absolutely worth buying because maybe we will use it or maybe we can experiment with it in this place. One of the things we're trying to do here is find a price point. It's going to be under a thousand bucks. I won't tell you exactly where, but we're trying to find a price point where it becomes a no-brainer. Like, you know what? We should buy this. We should have this. This should be in our toolkit, and we should use this in certain parts of our business, even if we don't replace this other thing. 

Although we still might, because we might find that as this group or these two groups or three groups that are using this are making exactly the same kind of progress—like, why are we spending all this money elsewhere? So it's a bit of a Trojan horse potentially. I don't know what's going to happen. No idea. But it's going to be pretty interesting. 

The other thing that's really cool about it is that this is the tiniest market in the world. Because it doesn't go out to the internet, you can run it in truly air-gapped research facilities. There was a time way back in the day when the White House got in touch with us—this was when Obama was running—and they wanted to use Basecamp. But they said, "We need to install it because we can't obviously host this stuff on your server." 

I totally get it; we can't do that, unfortunately. Sorry. But they have security needs that are just far beyond what most things allow. This is the kind of thing where they can actually be completely detached from the public internet and run this kind of software, which is really interesting. Again, it's a tiny market—not what we're building it for—but it's a cool by-product or side effect, I should say, of running things this way. 

And then, did you share when this might come out? I know you don't promise. Is there something you want to share there? 

Well, unfortunately, you promised. We said by the end of this year—that's why I was getting into that—but we're going to start with the first batch of customers. It's probably not going to be available publicly to everyone in the world yet, but that'll come soon after. The first batch of customers is going to get it, and we'll kind of slow roll it out, figure out what we missed, what we need to tighten up and tweak. 

It's not really a beta as much as it's just a limited release, which is the smart way to do this. Then we'll open the doors very, very soon after that. 

Jason, you're breaking your record. Jason, you're breaking your own rule of not saying by the end of the year. Apparently, I learned earlier that that never works. 

Yeah, it's funny. We definitely said that, and we said that like six months ago. Here we are, end of the year. It's happening, so maybe sometimes it works out.
