Okay, something else that I know is really important to you and also really unique to Canva is something that's called the two-step plan. You mentioned this earlier, and I want to definitely talk about this. What is the two-step plan? Why is this so important to you?

Yeah, so when you were asking about crazy big goals, I think this is our most macro, most crazy biggest goal. Step one is to build one of the world's most valuable companies, and step two is to do the most good we can do. In our early days, I thought I'd do step one and then step two, but I realized that actually step one can fuel step two, and step two can fuel step one. So that's been a really big part of Canva for some years now.

In the early days, we took the 1% pledge, which I think is an incredible program. Every single person, every single company should take that pledge where you give 1% of time, money, equity, and profitability. I think that's a really easy thing to do in the early days that can compound greatly over time. We also knew that Canva's equity was obviously going to be a really key part of it. Cliff and I owned a little over 30% of Canva, and so we decided we were going to take 30% of Canva and use it to do the most good we can do. And we are doing that.

We’re doing all of our donating through the Canva Foundation. Over the last few years, we've donated $50 million to GiveDirectly, which gives money directly to people in Malawi who are in extreme poverty. They can use that money for their families to go to school, to get healthcare, to start small businesses, or to get a roof so they can sleep in without being wet. Just like real, truly basic human needs.

We’ve just announced that we’re going to be giving another $100 million over the next four years to people in extreme poverty. When you sit with people and hear about how they're spending what is a microscopic amount to us—like $550—it doesn't buy us that much, but it's a life-changing amount of money for people in extreme poverty. It's truly transformational what it can do. You meet people, you hear their stories, and it's the best money I could ever imagine spending.

That crazy big dream I mentioned earlier of everyone having their basic human needs met is so completely insane that it isn't the case today. There's no specific reason why people don't have their basic human needs met on our planet; we just haven't got our act together as humanity. That is a truly crazy big dream. But back to the two-step plan: step one is to build one of the world's most valuable companies, and step two is to do the most good we can do. Finding ways to do that at the same time is extraordinarily important.

That's incredible. It makes me think about, not to mention Elon again, but Elon's three-step strategy plan. It's like build better cars versus this is like, okay, solve all the problems of the world and make the world a better place. What a better master plan. 

Something else about this that I love is that a lot of companies have something philanthropic going on, and it's like sitting in a dock on some page as part of their mission. It's not actually that big of a deal to them. What I hear from folks at Canva is that this is something you talk about all the time. This is actually a core part of how you work and think, and how you set goals and vision and missions.

Yeah, I'm happy to hear that. I wouldn't do Canva if it wasn't going to have a positive impact on the world. For me, getting really rich is not a goal unto itself whatsoever; it's a means to an end. I've been very blessed to do some work that creates wealth, which can then help meet people's basic human needs. 

It's completely unfair that some people are working just as hard but don’t have the same opportunities. Our education product is now used by 100 million people each month, and we are in most school districts, rolled out across countries. We're able to bring quality education tools to everyone, and we give that away for free as well. We’re going to be doubling down on that product to bring quality education to all.

I think it gives so much more meaning behind work. Between our education product and our nonprofit program, where we also give away our paid product for free, we're giving away $1.5 billion of product a year now. The impact that that can have and the ripple effect of that is pretty great.
