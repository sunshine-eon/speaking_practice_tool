And then just get other people involved. There's probably somebody around you who's good, so find people to edit your work and to look at it. I have a little Slack workspace that has three people in it—me and two other women who are product leaders. We often send each other our work and say, "Hey, I'm struggling with this. Can you read it? Help me make it simpler. Can you help me fix this up?" We do that for each other. So find a peer, maybe someone who's in a non-competitive space, who can do that for you. I still use those people to help me. That is extremely cool.

Can you talk more about this group that you have? Yeah, I don't know if it's a group; it's more like three friends. Shout out to Alexa and Daphne! The three of us all worked together when we were at Drift, and we've stayed in touch. I've found that in order to be good at your job continuously, you need people who can help give you feedback. The more senior you get, the harder that is. Having people who can provide another point of view, who you can vent to if it's not appropriate as a leader, and who can share other experiences they're going through has been incredibly valuable. We just have a little group chat that is focused on product.

That is so cool. Is there a tip you could share for someone wanting to create something like this? Is it important to have worked with them before? Is Slack a good way to communicate? Anything there that's just like, "Oh yeah, here's a cool tip"? Slack just worked for us because that's where we are during the day, and having easy access to it was important. You could probably use WhatsApp or a group text. There are small communities; for example, I worked in healthcare for a year and there’s a Slack community that someone organized for heads of products in healthcare startups. It was really powerful and a great space to be in. 

You just have to kind of suss out where these things are. You work with amazing people, and there are people around you who are going to become your friends. So keep an eye out for them and keep in touch when you leave a job because you never know when they might become your little support network.
