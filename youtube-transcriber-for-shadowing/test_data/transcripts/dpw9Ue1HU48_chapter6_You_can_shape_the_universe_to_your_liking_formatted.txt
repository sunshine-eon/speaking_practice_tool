============================================================

I love that this is an example of how you can build a company the way that you want to build it. You don't have to do it the way everybody else has done. I imagine there's a lot of challenges to this too, but I think it's inspiring to just say, "Hey, I'm going to design a company the way I want to build it." 

It's amazing what you can get away with in terms of shaping the new universe here. I think people automatically assume that things have to go a certain way, especially founders and first-time founders. It's like, you should at least try it. 

For example, both my co-founder and I are night people, not morning people. That just happens. I didn't pick him because of that; we didn't learn that until later. So, from the early days of UpSpot, we established a rule: no meetings before 11 a.m. That was it. 

We adjusted that rule maybe three or four years in, and we said, "All right, we can have meetings before 11 a.m., but you just can't invite one of the co-founders to it." So, you're welcome to meet amongst yourselves if you choose to do so. 

It's the little things that make a difference. I have a personal rule where I have no meetings before 3 p.m. because I don't work anywhere that can dictate my schedule. The idea is to create this deep work time at the beginning of the day. I love that.
