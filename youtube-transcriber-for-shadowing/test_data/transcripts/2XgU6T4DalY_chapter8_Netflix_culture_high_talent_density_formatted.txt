============================================================

Awesome. Okay. So we've kind of been talking around this, but this is an important part of the Netflix culture. Broadly, Netflix has a really special and unique culture. Even though it's been around for over 25 years now, it feels like the culture has come up many times. There's that initial culture deck that came out and blew everyone's minds. There's a recent book, "No Rules Rules," I think it's called, and it feels like Netflix has done a great job at maintaining its culture.

To me, there are three important elements, and maybe there are more. First is very high talent density and a focus on high performers. Second is candor and being really direct. Third is giving people freedom and responsibility while getting rid of useless processes like vacation time and things like that. 

Let's dive into that first element of high talent density and the focus on high performance. The question here is: how does this actually look at Netflix? Part of it is in hiring, part of it is in performance reviews. Why is this such a focus at Netflix? What happens when you have such a high talent density? It's intrinsic to who Netflix is as a company and reflects Reed Hastings as the founder of Netflix.

When he founded Netflix and grew the company over time, it was with the belief that there could be a different approach to building a company that would make it a place where people thrived and loved being. It would feel different from other places, both in the quality of talent density and, even more importantly, in the excellence and outcomes. That's where people derive a lot of their sense of fulfillment.

This focus on talent density is deeply seated at Netflix from its original days. A big piece of that talent density is definitely hiring. Who are the people coming in and joining the team? We can't really have any of the other aspects of the culture, including candor, learning, seeking excellence and improvement, or freedom and responsibility, if we don't start with high talent density. 

In some ways, that's not the end; it's the means to the end in what Reed and the rest of the leadership team have been trying to build. To achieve that, you have to hold yourself to a lot of standards that don't feel like natural human behavior. What I mean by that is giving the feedback.
