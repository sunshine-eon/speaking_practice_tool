============================================================

Amazing. Well, with that, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Archie, are you ready? 

I'm ready. First question. What are two or three books that you recommended most to other people? So one, I love to go back to like marketers who wrote in like the 1920s. And so one that I love is *Scientific Advertising* by Claude Hopkins. It's basically one of the first kind of direct marketers that came out and innovated on some of the concepts of copywriting and just how you sell a product. 

You can't make this product. You can't sell the product. Can you tell the product will help the customer achieve their goals? It's really fun. I find it really fun to go back in time. There's a lot of really good first principles thinking that I think we've actually lost in more modern stuff, where it's like personalization, bandits, optimization, all this stuff versus how do you actually write and sell things really effectively? *Scientific Advertising* is a great book. Just like the name alone, it sounds really cool, especially for someone in your shoes. That feels like the perfect book for your role. I think there's so much wisdom in just the things someone figured out many years ago about what convinces people to buy something. It's still true, and people overcomplicate it. Going back to the original is often really useful. 

Totally. And the perfect mile about the chase for a sub-four-minute mile by Roger Bannister and a few other folks is just wonderful. As a runner, it's a really fun book to read about perseverance and how these folks really competed to achieve that amazing goal of running a mile in under four minutes. 

Awesome. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed? 

You know, I went back in time and watched for the first time the entire season or all the episodes of *The Sopranos*, which was quite fun. I highly recommend it. I did that along with *The Wire* in the last six months. It's a lot of watching, you know, while I work out in the morning on my elliptical or bike. It's a nice motivator to just work out as I'm going to watch the next episode. 

*The Wire* is like hour-long episodes and five seasons with about 22 episodes per season, right? 

Yeah. Oh, geez. It's a lot of watching. But I did that once and was like, "I've got a lot of episodes to watch." Incredible. That's funny. I should say *The Sopranos*. I feel like a number of people recently told me they're watching the full *Sopranos* again. It's like a trend recently for some reason. 

Oh, interesting. Anyway, do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love? 

So the AI music creator! My kids and I—I'm the least musical person in the world—it's been amazing. My kids and I will create songs together about our days, about what's going on. It's just been really fun to have a musical experience for a non-musical person and have that creative experience for them. It's been really awesome. Tia. Suno is insane. I think at suno.ai, folks want to check it out. It's just such a fun party trick to write a song on the spot about something that you're thinking about. 

Awesome. Two more questions. What's your favorite life motto that you often come back to and find helpful in your current life? 

Yeah, I often come back to "the plan is the plan until it's not." Basically, we have a plan. If the plan is our best, let's commit to it, but acknowledge it might change. We have to deal with it then. It's kind of the combination of having a plan and staying focused on that, with the acknowledgment that you need to be flexible. It tries to combine those two sometimes contradictory things of focus on the plan with the ability to react effectively. 

Reminds me of strong opinions loosely held as a concept. 

Totally. Awesome. Okay, final question. I asked your wife what to ask you when you came on this podcast, and she suggested that I ask you about your late father, who had a lot of impact on your leadership style. So here's my question: what did you learn from your dad that impacts the way you work today? 

Yeah, my dad was a lot like a father and he was an entrepreneur in technology. One of the things I so appreciate about his leadership style was the empathy, curiosity, and kindness that he showed in everything. I hope some of the stories of him reflect that, like no matter who anyone was, he was curious and loved to engage and learn from them. I hope that's what I try to take inspiration from: just be kind to everyone and learn from everyone you're with and around. I think about that a lot. 

That super resonates. He sounds like a wonderful human. As are you, Archie. This was wonderful. We touched on so much. I feel like we could go on for many more hours. Maybe we'll do round two as you learn more things during your time with Shopify. 

Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to potentially reach out or follow the stuff you're up to? And how can listeners be useful to you? 

Yeah, so I'm not super active on social media, but you can find me on LinkedIn. Check me out and send me a message. Also, if folks are hiring a bunch of people—growth marketers, PMs, engineers, data folks, UXers—who want to work at Shopify in growth or other parts, it's fully remote. We'd love to have great people join. 

Awesome. And that last point I think I'll just highlight: you're one of the few remaining fully remote tech companies that is not returning to the office. 

Definitely. Yes. Amazing. It sounds like you're hiring across all functions. 

All functions. 

Perfect. Archie, thank you so much for being here.
