Chapter 23: Lightning round
Video: LinkedIn’s product evolution and the art of building complex systems | Hari Srinivasan (LinkedIn)
Time: 55:02 - 64:48
============================================================

[54:59] Let's get all your gummy bears.
[55:02] With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.
[55:05] Are you ready?
[55:06] Yeah, let's do it.
[55:07] What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?
[55:10] The first one is called Thinking in Systems.
[55:13] It's the one I give kind of the team every now and then.
[55:15] It's just a.
[55:17] Yeah, it's just a really good book about how I think how the people say systems
[55:21] or you know, can we kind of talk about it can be abstract?
[55:23] I think it goes into real detail and how people can, you know,
[55:27] intervene at various parts in how to take actions at different systems.
[55:30] I really enjoyed that book.
[55:31] Directly, maybe a book I recommend, but a book that I just read that I thought was
[55:35] phenomenal just to give readers want something good.
[55:37] It's called Tomorrow, Tomorrow and Tomorrow.
[55:39] I was recommending my friend.
[55:40] Have you read it?
[55:40] You read it? Yeah, I honestly didn't love it, but I liked it a lot.
[55:44] I really I for some reason I thought it was very well done.
[55:48] And there's a couple of chapters I reflected on it.
[55:50] I just finished it.
[55:51] I thought it was I thought it was well done.
[55:53] So that's one that I'll throw out there.
[55:54] Yeah, it was very sweet.
[55:55] I feel like I got you got hype too much for me.
[55:57] I'm like, OK, I didn't know.
[55:59] I didn't actually know it got the key publicity.
[56:01] OK, that's it.
[56:03] The third one that I just downloaded, because I finished, I'm actually going to
[56:06] open up my my audiobook and tell you because I'm about, I don't know,
[56:10] an hour into it and I'm really enjoying it.
[56:12] It is an immense world.
[56:14] I don't know if you read that one yet.
[56:16] It is about animals and how animals have different senses out there.
[56:20] And it goes kind of through a set of different animals like and kind of how
[56:23] they see the world.
[56:23] And just one of those reminders that, you know, we're so limited
[56:27] sometimes in our own interception and kind of how dogs, for instance, say,
[56:31] you know, they can breathe in and take in sense even when they're breathing out.
[56:35] And so they're constantly it's like vision almost.
[56:37] And it's just phenomenal to me to kind of think about all the things
[56:39] they're probably sensing as we're going out of my dog and I are going on our walk.
[56:42] I've learned dogs like shoot air out of their nose first before they smell
[56:46] to kind of clear things out.
[56:48] And so I mean, it's not wild.
[56:50] They kind of they can probably see so much more of what happened in the
[56:53] history of like a little walk than we're able to just because of that.
[56:57] Incredible. Next question.
[56:59] What is a favorite recent movie or TV show?
[57:03] So one thing we try to do is watch TV as a family kind of brings us together a
[57:06] little bit. So we we are doing Star Wars with the kids, which is for the first time,
[57:11] which has been a really enjoyable experience, just being able to witness it through them.
[57:14] And then we've been going a little bit back in time.
[57:17] So we watched E.T. which is, you know, it's fun.
[57:20] It jobs in memory.
[57:21] These are phenomenal movies that we go through.
[57:23] I think your question is on recent TV shows that probably came up more recently.
[57:27] Those work just as well.
[57:28] Yeah. The other one I did like, it's not a TV show, but I
[57:35] was called Case Night.
[57:36] It was that podcast that came out, Case 63, I think it was called.
[57:39] And it was a I hope that's the right name of it.
[57:41] But it was like it was a sci fi podcast.
[57:44] It was like 10 minutes short.
[57:46] And the premise of it is someone comes from the future and there's a little bit
[57:49] of speculative fiction and is at a psychologist.
[57:51] And it was it's just a phenomenal piece.
[57:54] I have to get you the real name.
[57:54] Maybe I can get it if you after for the show.
[57:56] Yeah, well edit your words and add whatever's in the show notes.
[58:00] That's the way it meant.
[58:02] What is a favorite interview question you like to ask?
[58:05] I do like to ask people what kind of the most complex thing they ever built was.
[58:10] And I just love to understand most mostly kind of what where do they gravitate to?
[58:14] Like, is that something you're up to?
[58:15] And two, are they able to simplify it?
[58:16] And I think those are two really important skills.
[58:19] What is it that you look for in their answer that tells you it was a good answer?
[58:23] Both of those things.
[58:24] So first, did they take on something that was super complex?
[58:26] Like really, really hard, because I think there's only a particular group
[58:29] who will gravitate to those kinds of realm.
[58:31] And I do think more and more.
[58:33] I mean, I think that's a lot of kind of the.
[58:36] A lot of the, in my opinion, the ways the world is going to get better by the
[58:40] things that are really, really hard to solve.
[58:41] You can think about kind of the intimacy doesn't scale, right?
[58:44] So when you think about how people are going to feel more connected, it's going
[58:48] to be kind of a lot more difficult to solve.
[58:50] When you think about health care, it's going to be very, very difficult to solve.
[58:52] Education is a very difficult, interconnected space.
[58:55] And so I think people who gravitate to them know those problems are hard,
[58:59] have a very special kind of gift and kind of a, it's hard to replicate that passion.
[59:05] So one, did you do that?
[59:06] And then two, I think people who really kind of understand systems are able to
[59:10] somehow this truly special people probably way smarter than me.
[59:13] They're able to simplify it and they're able to explain it and say, this is how
[59:16] I looked at it, but here's how I modeled it.
[59:17] And here's kind of the lovers and how I went after it.
[59:19] And, you know, even if it's nonlinear, they're able to say, this is how
[59:22] the cause and effects works.
[59:24] And I'm really looking for, you know, once you did it, did you really
[59:26] understand them, were you able to crack it?
[59:28] Or at least did you understand why you weren't able to crack it?
[59:31] And I usually find this to be also the most kind of rewarding conversations.
[59:35] Awesome.
[59:35] Thanks for sharing all that.
[59:37] Next question.
[59:38] What is a favorite recent product that you've discovered that you love?
[59:42] I'll give you one more dead one.
[59:44] You know, so my youngest just hates brushing his teeth, just was like,
[59:47] and there is, I should actually find the name of the toothbrush, but you can
[59:50] just Google or Amazon this and you'll figure it out.
[59:52] It was basically, it's like, it was this baby shark toothbrush, but it's,
[59:56] it's a game and you played that game for two minutes and you can try to
[59:59] like pick up different prizes you brush your teeth and turned what I loved about
[60:03] it, because I think it's what all great products do.
[60:04] It turns a moment of like annoyance to a moment of joy.
[60:08] Right.
[60:08] It went like, not even just like you, you saw the pain point.
[60:11] It was like an unreasonable experience of like, now he loves it.
[60:14] And like, you know, it was just so well done.
[60:17] It's like 10 bucks and it was 10 bucks extremely well spent, so much light.
[60:20] So whoever made that toothbrush.
[60:22] Thank you.
[60:23] Damn.
[60:23] And is it playing baby shark?
[60:24] I hope not.
[60:25] Well, it can, it has that feature and has that capability, but it is a small
[60:30] price to pay for, for me to get out, you know, to enjoy.
[60:35] Good times.
[60:36] What's something relatively minor that you've changed in your
[60:39] product development process that has had a big impact on your team's ability to
[60:43] execute?
[60:44] I do like to change things, you know, relatively, like every quarter or six
[60:48] months kind of sit down and kind of say, what can we get better at?
[60:51] And the two areas I find myself innovating, if you will, innovating or
[60:54] tweaking the most is when is around planning?
[60:58] Right.
[60:59] I think every company struggles with this and you get bigger.
[61:01] It probably becomes a more kind of difference, especially when we talked
[61:03] about the complexity of the ecosystem.
[61:05] And we started this thing where just basically we call it like orange and
[61:07] red priorities, which is a lot of times what people do is teams will
[61:11] plan bottom up, they'll come into a manager or a leader and then the leader
[61:15] may shift things around or say this way.
[61:17] I think we've really started shifting it in a different way.
[61:20] We said, these are the big rocks we got to get done.
[61:22] We're going to get those things done first.
[61:24] We're going to be upfront and honest with you and these are the things and
[61:26] these are priorities.
[61:26] And then you can kind of plan from there.
[61:28] And that's been, I think it's relieved a lot of the progress.
[61:31] So I think there's an honesty that comes with it and that's been a big change.
[61:34] The others just are kind of the way we review products.
[61:37] That's always been a kind of thing.
[61:38] And my, my read is when we keep our product review process live too long, it
[61:43] gets a little institutionalized and people start making, you know, like long
[61:47] documents and stuff, right?
[61:47] So you always have to change that every quarter.
[61:49] And, and basically, I think it always comes down to the same thing, which is
[61:52] how do you get their problem statement quickly?
[61:54] And then how do you kind of design from there?
[61:56] But the lever that we basically put in place for that was really short in the time.
[62:00] So like I'm trying this thing, I don't know if it's going to work, but
[62:02] could we get to like 15 minute reviews basically instead of an hour and see if
[62:06] that kind of alleviates some of this.
[62:09] I'll let you know how it goes when we chat up next.
[62:10] But I, I, I'm very curious to see if this is going to be a different kind of
[62:14] system where we might be able to get to clarity quicker or realize we're not in
[62:18] clarity and then break and come back.
[62:21] Reminds me of a tweet I think I just saw maybe was Instagram post of teams that
[62:25] do standups while doing a plank to keep the meeting really short.
[62:29] That's interesting.
[62:30] I haven't tried that one yet, but it might be nothing we try next.
[62:34] Last question.
[62:35] You've been at LinkedIn for a long time.
[62:37] I imagine you use LinkedIn a lot.
[62:39] Is there just a pro tip that you can share of how to be more successful with
[62:44] LinkedIn, buy more value LinkedIn, enjoy more?
[62:46] The first is, I do think, you know, certainly there's ways and the majority
[62:50] of ways that skills work as we infer skills, but I wouldn't, I think that
[62:54] there is a skill section on the profile.
[62:55] I think a lot of people ignore it because they don't realize that there's
[62:57] value in it and that's changing, but I'm not sure if it's changing for everybody.
[63:01] And I would pay more attention to skills as we kind of get in more in the skills
[63:04] first off.
[63:04] The second thing I would probably do, I don't know if it's that hidden, but I
[63:08] would check out LinkedIn learning.
[63:10] I do think LinkedIn learning is a gem.
[63:11] And I think because it's sold largely through enterprises, a lot of people
[63:14] miss it and I would hope you check it out, but more importantly, tell me areas
[63:17] that, uh, you know, we could get better on there as well.
[63:20] And I hope that people will find value.
[63:22] What's the best way to find out about LinkedIn learning?
[63:24] They just Google LinkedIn learning and they'll find the LinkedIn back slash learning.
[63:28] Yeah.
[63:28] LinkedIn.com slash learning.
[63:30] Okay.
[63:30] Great.
[63:31] Uh, Hari, I feel like we've opened the mind of Hari up on this podcast.
[63:36] I appreciate you being here.
[63:37] Two final questions.
[63:38] Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and how can listeners
[63:41] be useful to you?
[63:42] You can find me on LinkedIn.
[63:43] That's an easy one.
[63:44] And, uh, the, uh, you know, I, I do really, really, really appreciate product feedback.
[63:50] Like I promise you, I take it well for those listening.
[63:53] And two, it is, you know, going back to the kind of the heart of this
[63:56] conversation around complexity, it is really hard to know sometimes whatever
[63:59] it's experience is because you're living in a very kind of abstracted ecosystem.
[64:03] And so the more you could just say, Hey, this is working or not.
[64:06] And the intentions are coming from a good place.
[64:08] And if you, um, if you have a moment and you're not having a great experience,
[64:11] who are having great experience, you can write it.
[64:13] I really would appreciate to hear your perspective.
[64:15] Amazing.
