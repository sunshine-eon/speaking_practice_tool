Chapter 10: Why founders should be “in the details”

Details. And by the way, Lenny, here's the funny thing: before the crisis, a lot of people felt like I was too involved in different areas. Once the crisis happened, guess what happened? People were like, "What do we do? We need you more involved." And so I got more involved. When I got involved, I made the following changes. 

The first thing I did was to say that everything we're doing has to be written down and put into Google Sheets. It turns out people couldn't even write down everything they were doing. I remember one person told me, "You think we're doing too many things for me to ever be able to document." I'm like, "What?" But anyways, we eventually got everyone to write everything down. I said, "Okay, we can do about 20% of these things." If everyone says, "Oh, I might be simple, I'm only doing three things," yes, but you're one of like a thousand people. So actually, we're doing 3,000 things. Instead of one team doing three things, three teams should do one thing. 

We totally cut down the number of projects and removed layers of management. I wanted to have as few layers as possible between leaders and teams. We went to a functional model and back to a startup structure. We decided we weren't going to have divisional leaders; instead, we would have design, engineering, product, product marketing, marketing and communications, sales, and operations. All the functions of a startup. I said we would have fewer employees and more senior people. There's a great saying that the best way to slow a project down is to add more people to it. So we felt that having very few employees was beneficial. We have fewer than 7,000 employees today; as a relative comparison, I think Uber has 30,000. That's not to say they're big; it's just to say that's how small we are, and we've really benefited from having not a lot of employees.

We made sure that every executive was an expert in their functional domain. You know how there are a lot of engineering managers who aren't that technical? Or maybe not a lot, but they exist. There are designers, but there are design leaders who lead the people. A design leader's job should be managing the design first and the people second. That's what Johnny did. I could never imagine Johnny at Apple just being a manager of people; he was looking and designing the work with the team. How do you manage the people without managing their work? How do you give them development if you're not in the details with them on the work? So the same thing is true: people had to be experts. Everyone had to be an expert.

I stopped pushing decision-making down and pulled it in. I created one shared consciousness. I said the top 30 or 40 people in the company are going to have one continuous conversation. Metrics are going to be subordinate to the calendar. We established a roadmap that would be a two-year roadmap, updated literally every month. People may wonder, "What if the world changes?" Well, it changes every day. So the roadmap is something where the next month doesn't change, but two years out, it does; it's a rolling roadmap. 

And by the way, if Ukraine gets invaded and you want to provide housing for refugees, you can still pivot people and adapt very quickly. We housed 120,000 refugees. So you still keep a reserve of resources to be able to pivot and do things because there are always unexpected events. I created this new function called product marketing. We basically described what that is. I needed the group to be much smaller. I took a lot of product managers and reassigned them as program managers. I had many of them trained as actual program managers because their roles got much bigger. 

Program management at Airbnb is a high-status job. In a lot of companies, it's like a coordination job. But at Airbnb, we said that because we're going to do launches, it's high status. We decided we would do two launches a year, and you can't ship something unless it's on the roadmap. So every single thing in the company, with the exception of some infrastructure projects, has to be on the roadmap. Then I would review all the work. 

We created the CEO review schedule, where I said I would get back in the fall from the project, and I would review all the product and marketing. Every project would be reviewed every week, every two weeks, every four weeks, every eight weeks, and every 12 weeks. There would be a cadence. I had a head program manager who would score all the projects as either green, yellow, or red, indicating whether they were on track or not on track to ship. We wouldn't know until after we shipped it, but I used the reviews of the work every single week.

The reason there's not a lot of bureaucracy and why you don't need any influence at Airbnb is that I reviewed the work. If something wasn't happening, I would stop the meeting and say, "Why isn't this happening?" We would all get together. So you couldn't have a situation where a team wouldn't collaborate. I could then feel the work of an individual engineer. Imagine it's like we're a car company, and I see the car prototype every week. I notice there's something about the tire that's off. Now I can identify the individual person who was blocked. 

Every week, I would try to see the equivalent of at least a semi-assembly of the entire new product we were working on, which allowed me to identify the different bottlenecks happening in the company. The reviews were what allowed us to dictate the pace. Because we had annual reviews and all these review cycles, I didn't need to mandate we were going back to an office. I didn't really care where they worked because I could track how well they were working because of the review cycle. These were some of the changes that we made.
