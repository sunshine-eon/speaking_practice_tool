============================================================

[00:00] Elizabeth, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.
[00:04] Thank you. Thank you for having me.
[00:06] So when we booked this conversation, you are VP of data and Netflix,
[00:10] and since then you've got a promotion, you're now the CTO of Netflix,
[00:13] which feels significantly more fancy.
[00:15] Question for you.
[00:17] What is life like now that you are CTO versus VP of data?
[00:21] How is it most different? I'm imagining more meetings.
[00:25] I would say the biggest thing that changed is probably the amount of context
[00:31] switching and the degree to which I feel behind or I have a lot to learn.
[00:37] And I felt like I had a lot to learn in the VP of data and insights role
[00:42] that I was in before, in part because we cover a lot of different areas of the business
[00:46] and there's always people to learn from.
[00:48] But the engineering organization just takes that to 100, basically.
[00:53] So more people to get to know, more problem spaces,
[00:57] aspects of technical expertise that I'm just not as deeply familiar with.
[01:02] And then, yeah, a lot more meetings.
[01:05] I imagine many higher stakes meetings as well.
[01:08] Yes, so thankfully not a lot of meetings at Netflix feel like now you're really
[01:14] in this scary room, but it does feel like the role has more consequence,
[01:19] which is actually an exciting thing.
