[00:00] of it.
[00:00] I heard you say along the same lines on a different podcast about how when you were
[00:04] really busy, you didn't have time to reach out to anyone.
[00:06] And they never thought they could reach out to you because they thought you were
[00:09] so busy.
[00:10] In the old world, I was reacting.
[00:12] So everyone thought I was busy.
[00:14] So the people I really cared about, a lot of them said, well, he's busy.
[00:17] So who reached out to me when he's not busy?
[00:19] But here's the problem.
[00:20] I was so busy that all he was doing all day was responding to people.
[00:25] And so if people I cared about didn't reach out to me, I was just, I was
[00:29] dealing with incoming.
[00:30] I could barely deal the incoming.
[00:32] Now that was a mistake, but I was reacting.
[00:36] And so by the way, here's another lesson for founders.
[00:40] A lot of founders spend their time based on the reacting.
[00:44] So people will email them and they'll wake up and they'll reply to emails.
[00:48] And suddenly their email sets the agenda.
[00:50] People ask for meetings and suddenly the meetings they take are based on the
[00:53] people who email them versus like, here's my strategy.
[00:57] And then over the next year, what are the relationships I need to have and the
[01:00] meetings need to take to be able to actually do strategy.
[01:03] If my life were to end in a year or in 10 years or some time horizon that's
[01:09] shorter than I expected, who are the people I would have wanted to make sure I
[01:13] spent time with?
[01:14] And if you imagine that your life is finite, because it is, and you imagine,
[01:21] you're not going to be here as long as you thought you would be, because it's
[01:24] possible that we completely change how you prioritize your time.
[01:29] I think suddenly you would start to say no to things and you'd say yes to other things.
[01:34] I now try to say no to what I call fake work, which is things that feel like work,
[01:39] but they don't actually move the ball down the field.
[01:42] I really try to say yes to work that's very meaningful and people that are very
[01:46] meaningful to me.
[01:47] So yeah, it's a really, really good insight.
[01:48] And by the way, that metaphor Lenny, it's true of companies too.
[01:52] You can sometimes be like, you don't want to only spend your time reacting or spending
[01:58] your time with the employees reaching out to you.
[02:00] I mean, you do want to do some of it, but then you're rewarding only one type of
[02:06] behavior and the introverts or the people that aren't reaching out to you aren't
[02:10] going to get any attention.
[02:12] Just one more question and then I have a quick fun question at the end.
[02:14] I know you have to run.
