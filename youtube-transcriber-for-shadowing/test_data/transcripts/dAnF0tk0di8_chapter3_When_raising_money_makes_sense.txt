[00:00] business.
[00:01] So the bet, just kind of following the same thread, the bet that companies are making obviously
[00:04] going down the venture route is they are going to lose money for a long time so that they
[00:07] can make much, much more money in the future.
[00:11] And so the idea there is grow as fast as possible, as big as possible, and then we'll
[00:15] make money.
[00:16] You're a big advocate of not raising venture and bootstrapping.
[00:20] So just like, what's your advice to founders for when raising money makes sense?
[00:25] I actually wrote this article, one's called Your Startup is Probably Not Venture Scale.
[00:29] Just trying to convince people, like you may have a really good idea, but it doesn't mean
[00:32] it's a venture scale business.
[00:34] And I feel like we're aligned on this.
[00:37] What's your advice to founders there?
[00:38] I think, you know, obviously if you're, I think if you're building cars or you need
[00:43] a factory or you're opening a restaurant and there's actual like things you need to buy
[00:46] like ovens and you need to hire people around the bat and you need to pay rent, you
[00:51] need capital.
[00:52] And it could come from you, come from friends and family, it could come from an investor,
[00:55] it can come from a bank loan.
[00:56] There's lots of places to get it, but you'd need it.
[00:59] You know, software businesses though, and you know, businesses like ours, we just make software
[01:06] and a lot of people in our industry are like us in that respect.
[01:11] They need a couple laptops and a couple people and like it's pretty cheap.
[01:15] It's really pretty cheap to keep going and the margins are incredibly healthy in software
[01:19] or they should be.
[01:20] What's interesting is that Silicon Valley has found a way to make the most profitable
[01:25] style of business, the least profitable.
[01:27] Like software has, there's like no physical costs, it should, the margin should be close
[01:32] to 80 or 90% and it turns out that they're barely even, you know, most of them are positive
[01:37] in the end or they're just slicing or sliding by basically.
[01:41] I don't understand how that, why do I mean they have too many people and they spend
[01:45] too much money on customer acquisition and all that stuff, but it blows me away.
[01:50] Like most businesses in the world would die, would love, I should say love, to have Silicon
[01:57] Valley style economics, like make something that doesn't cost much to make and then sell
[02:02] it for high prices, but everyone, the corner store, you know, the pizza shop, they wish
[02:07] they could do this and they can't because they have physical products that they have
[02:10] to sell and they have to buy, you know, goods and they have to get raw materials
[02:13] and convert that into a pizza and there's just costs involved with that and they
[02:17] can't sell for too much because the other place down the street sells it for less
[02:19] and, you know, so, again, I'm kind of getting off track, but if you're going to
[02:24] make, if you're going to start a business that really truly requires cash, typically
[02:28] capital expenditures, expensive things, hardware, whatever, of course, you need
[02:32] that, but I don't think you do otherwise.
[02:34] And I think it actually hurts you if you go out and think that you do because
[02:38] there really is only kind of one outcome for venture backed companies,
[02:42] which is go huge.
[02:45] And if you think about all of the space between kind of a small business and
[02:50] a massive huge unicorny business, there's so much room there that you could
[02:54] normally find your own way and slide into a slot or a place that makes
[02:58] sense for you.
[03:00] But if you're venture backed, you just don't even have the opportunity.
[03:03] You blow right past those or they want you to blow right past those.
[03:07] And if you don't, you kind of wither on the vine and die essentially.
[03:10] And it's just too bad.
