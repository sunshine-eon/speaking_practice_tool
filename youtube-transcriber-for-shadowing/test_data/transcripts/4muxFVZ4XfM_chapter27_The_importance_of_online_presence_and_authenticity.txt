============================================================

[00:00] on board. Such a great lesson. Just a few more questions. You mentioned that you launched on Twitter
[00:07] and that led to a large waitlist and a growing waitlist. Is there anything you did before that
[00:12] to kind of build this following? You know, that sounds like really, like really amazing. Cool. We
[00:15] just announced that on Twitter and we have this large waitlist and then we grow and we get
[00:19] all these customers. Is there anything you did ahead of time in anticipation of this launch?
[00:24] Would you recommend people work on building some kind of following online before they were
[00:27] going to start it? Was it just like, hey, we happen to have this kind of following and it worked
[00:30] out? Anything along those lines you would recommend to founders these days?
[00:35] Yeah, I mean, I think definitely if you have a following and like, I hope it depends what kind
[00:40] of following, but I think like my background as a designer, I would say like at the Airbnb
[00:45] and Coinbase and other places and I did some like talks and conferences and write some
[00:51] blog posts. So I was definitely like out there and then kind of had some of that following.
[00:57] Which was helpful, but it wasn't like I have like thousands of like hundreds of thousands of
[01:02] followers or millions or something. I had maybe like 10,000 or something, which is like a
[01:07] significant number. But then I think like the other thing is, I think with the announcement,
[01:13] like one of the things we did, I think, well, it's like, I think sometimes startups do
[01:19] try to like emulate successful large companies too much. And you kind of like do this like
[01:27] fancy announcements where it's like, hey, now we're like doing this fancy thing. And then
[01:31] it's like sounds very like corporate or something. And I think with that, with our
[01:36] announcement, we try to like wrote it more like direct or authentic to us. Like this is
[01:43] like what are we going to do? And this is why I'm like this, these are some of the
[01:46] things we're going to do. Then on Twitter, we did the same thing, like all of us founders,
[01:51] we wrote our own reasons why we're doing this. And I think it was like just much more like,
[01:55] and I think like people could, people like us could resonate more with it. So we were kind
[02:00] of writing to the right audience. And like, I think that's probably the first thing you're
[02:06] like, when you're announcing your company, it's like, you think about like, who is my
[02:10] first audience? Like, who would be the best users, like early users for this product? And
[02:17] like, where are they? And then like, how do they think about things? And like,
[02:21] what kind of language they use? So for us, it was like, it came very naturally because we
[02:26] are these people, we're in building software and these companies. And we've seen, like other
[02:32] people have seen similar things we have seen. So I think it that the way we announced it
[02:37] like resonated with a lot of people. And then I think we did have some friends. And as I said,
[02:44] like, we got some data like angel round, where we got some like friends involved. And the main
[02:49] reason we did it was that we just felt like it's in the early days, it's good to have like,
[02:55] you feel like a real company in a way that like you have someone to answer for in a way,
[02:59] even though the investors normally run your company, or they don't have that much power,
[03:03] it's more like, oh, I took someone's money, so I now need to like make it worth it kind of.
[03:09] But then like, I think with the announcement again, like we could use some of those people to
[03:13] like, spread the message as well.
