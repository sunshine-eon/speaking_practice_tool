============================================================

Yep. Maggie, we've gone through everything that I was hoping to get through and more, which is awesome. Great. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you want to share, touch on, think might be useful to leave folks with? 

I hope that people, my hope is always that people listen to stuff like this and realize that it's messier than you think. You can fail a lot and still be successful and that they should have fun. I think that also, that gets missed in a lot of the product content is like, have fun, enjoy it. 

People are weird. People do weird stuff and you build stuff for people, which makes it all very entertaining. So I've always found a lot of joy in the job. And to your point of carrying the water as a PM where you're kind of doing all the things, it's like, you can create that fun. You can make the team your own fun and change the culture, create the culture. I find that so underappreciated for a PM.
