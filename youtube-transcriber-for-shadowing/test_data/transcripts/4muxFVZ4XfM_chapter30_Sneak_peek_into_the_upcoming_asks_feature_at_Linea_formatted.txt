============================================================

For the actual final question, before we get to a very exciting lightning round, what's just the future of Linear? What's coming? What's happening in the future? Is there anything you can share?

Yeah, I think there are always things we're working on and improving. One newer feature we're developing is called "asks." Basically, we see that in a company, there can be a lot of different people who need to interact with the product team or other teams, but they are not necessarily part of Linear or directly involved with these teams.

So, we are building this "ask" feature, which is an integration with Slack. With this feature, you can easily go to a Slack channel and ask a question or request something from a specific team. For example, if you need a laptop from the IT team or assistance from the infrastructure team, you can make that request through Slack.

The team handling the request can then easily send it to Linear into a triage system we have in place. If they have questions or need additional information from the person who made the request, they can send those messages back through Slack. This means that the requester doesn't have to go to Linear or be a Linear user to engage with the process.

We believe this is a good way for the entire company to be more involved in product operations without needing to be a power user of Linear. Not every function really uses it or needs to use it, so this feature aims to bridge that gap and enhance collaboration across teams.
