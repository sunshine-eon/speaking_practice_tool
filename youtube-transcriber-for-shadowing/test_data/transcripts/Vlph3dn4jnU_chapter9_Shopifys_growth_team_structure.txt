============================================================

[00:00] This is a good segue to, I want to hear how you structure your growth team at Shopify.
[00:05] Like essentially, what's the raw structure, what are the different teams, and what do
[00:08] they focus on, and then what are the functions within each teams?
[00:11] We have two big groups within growth.
[00:15] So one is, we call growth R&D.
[00:17] So this might be, you're traditionally considered like product design, engineering, data,
[00:22] your traditional product teams.
[00:23] Then we have growth marketing, which in Shopify's case is paid acquisition, media
[00:28] buying, affiliate marketing, email, content and SEO.
[00:33] So that's kind of like growth R&D, growth marketing.
[00:36] Within growth R&D, three pillars.
[00:41] One is what we call growth products.
[00:43] And so this is basically everything from landing pages, sign up, onboarding, monetization,
[00:52] so trial incentives, the like, all the way through to what we call our home feed, our
[00:58] engagement to basically get more merchants again, honestly to retain, but to keep giving
[01:03] entrepreneurship a try to become bigger and bigger businesses.
[01:06] So that's growth product, kind of the full life cycle there.
[01:10] Second is what we call our enable pillar.
[01:11] And this pillar is building tools for both growth and the rest of Shopify.
[01:16] So things like experimentation platform, our communication platform, of our business
[01:20] intelligence tooling that powers a lot of what we're doing, our more tech work to
[01:25] support our growth marketing team.
[01:27] And then our third bucket, which is maybe a little different from most growth teams,
[01:30] is actually our customer support groups within growth, because we want to think
[01:34] about customer support as part of this merchant journey of coming on, giving
[01:40] entrepreneurship a try all the way through to here's the support I need as I'm
[01:44] becoming a multi-billion dollar business on Shopify.
[01:48] So those are like the three big growth product buckets and then within
[01:52] growth marketing, the more traditional channel set up paid all the different
[01:57] channels online, offline, SEO, email and affiliates.
[02:02] Super cool.
[02:03] Okay.
[02:03] So within growth, our idea just notes, I'm going to summarize, but
[02:07] you just share which is awesome.
[02:08] So there's kind of three big buckets.
[02:09] One is growth product, which essentially is like onboarding.
[02:12] It feels like it's like the top of funnel, get people in.
[02:17] Well, okay.
[02:17] So growth marketing feels like that's super top funnel.
[02:19] Bring the super top funnel.
[02:21] Yeah.
[02:21] Okay.
[02:21] Got it.
[02:22] So growth marketing, drive people to Shopify.com.
[02:26] Then growth within our need team growth product takes that user and
[02:31] tries to get them to activated enable helps.
[02:35] It feels like that's like internal tooling and ways to make the teams
[02:38] internally more efficient.
[02:39] Correct.
[02:40] Old growth and outside growth.
[02:42] Awesome.
[02:42] Okay.
[02:43] And then the customer support team, that's really interesting.
[02:46] So there's a customer support product team that helps new
[02:51] merchants be successful.
[02:53] And does that include like actual customer support agents?
[02:57] Is that like within that team?
[02:59] That's not.
[02:59] We build a tooling to make those support advisors kind of superheroes.
[03:04] And then on the help center, all of our AI stuff to make kind of a great customer
[03:10] experience for people who are just engaging in a self-serve.
[03:12] I'm just a tooling in the experience for for.
