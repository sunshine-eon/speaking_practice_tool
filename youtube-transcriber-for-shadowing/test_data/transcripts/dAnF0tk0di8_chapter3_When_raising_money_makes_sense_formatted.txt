The bet that companies are making by going down the venture route is that they will lose money for a long time in order to make much more money in the future. The idea is to grow as fast and as big as possible, with the expectation that profitability will come later. However, I advocate for bootstrapping instead of raising venture capital. So, when does raising money actually make sense for founders?

I wrote an article titled "Your Startup is Probably Not Venture Scale" to convince people that while they may have a good idea, it doesn't necessarily mean it's a venture-scale business. I believe we are aligned on this topic. My advice to founders is that if you're building cars, opening a restaurant, or need to buy physical assets like ovens, you will need capital. This capital can come from various sources: yourself, friends and family, investors, or bank loans. In these cases, securing funding is essential.

On the other hand, for software businesses, like ours, the situation is different. We primarily need a couple of laptops and a few people to get started, making it relatively inexpensive to operate. The margins in software should be incredibly healthy, ideally around 80 or 90%. However, it's interesting to note that Silicon Valley has managed to turn the most profitable type of business into one of the least profitable. Many software companies barely break even, often due to excessive spending on customer acquisition and staffing.

Most businesses in the world would love to have the economics that Silicon Valley enjoys—creating something with low production costs and selling it at high prices. However, traditional businesses, like corner stores or pizza shops, face significant challenges. They have physical products that require raw materials and incur costs, and they can't charge too much because of competition. 

If you're starting a business that truly requires cash for capital expenditures or expensive hardware, then, of course, you need funding. However, I believe seeking venture capital can actually hurt you if your business doesn't require it. Venture-backed companies are typically pressured to go huge, and in doing so, they often overlook the vast opportunities that exist between small businesses and massive unicorns. This pressure can lead to a situation where they either grow rapidly or wither away, which is unfortunate.
