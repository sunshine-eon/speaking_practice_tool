============================================================

[00:00] I know that this is a big part of Netflix culture and I want to get into it, but before that, I'm
[00:04] curious just what that looks like with people that report to you. How do you help them level up in
[00:10] this skill of having a really high bar? And an example I'll give as you think about maybe an
[00:15] example is the way I describe this to my PMs was you want to have this aura that you've got this,
[00:21] that if you give Lenny something, he's got this. He's going to follow up, he's going to close the
[00:25] loop, he's going to get it done. If he can't get it done, he'll tell me, I feel like this thread
[00:29] will not disappear. You want to drop this ball. Is there anything that you've learned is a good
[00:34] way to help someone learn this kind of skill? I understand why this is so important.
[00:38] It shows up for the people who report to me is one part example setting. So if I don't do it,
[00:46] why would they do it? And I treat that very seriously that we should all be held to the
[00:55] same standards. And as a second thing, I give feedback when it's not up to the standard.
[01:04] So I think some one of the things I've observed, especially with people on my teams is that
[01:10] the expectations aren't always clear. And you can't assume that they're clear if you don't
[01:16] share them. And when something's not meeting expectations are really showing up as excellence,
[01:24] I think it's a combination of both giving the feedback on that and being direct about it
[01:30] and being specific about what would it take to get this to the bar that I'm expecting or to
[01:37] show up in the way that I'm expecting. And then the third and probably most important thing is help
[01:42] them fill that gap. So that would mean like, let's take an example, it certainly has happened
[01:49] frequently in many jobs, like a document is okay, it's not great. It's not going to be easy for
[01:55] people to follow it's not as crisp as it could be. There's things that would strengthen it.
[02:01] I can both give the feedback on that to make sure like, yes, it's going to take another round of
[02:06] iteration. Yes, we're going to have to work another week on this and not be done with it,
[02:12] but pushing people to get there and then jumping into the document and helping. So I feel very
[02:18] strongly about and that's kind of what I mean by setting an example of like, let's work on this
[02:22] together. And then through that help people up level themselves. So the next time around,
[02:27] they kind of they know the expectations and they've had help kind of getting there in the past. So
[02:33] that's probably happened 1000 times in my career, where I jump in with both feet because something
[02:40] needs to be better. And I think the teams are better for it afterwards or I hope they are.
[02:44] I think that's such a good framework just to kind of mirror back what you said,
[02:47] set expectations that the bar is going to be really high. And here's what I'm expecting from you.
[02:52] Give them very specific feedback on where the gap is and then help them build that gap.
[02:57] And I think a lot of people may feel this and hear this and are like, oh man, I don't want a
[03:02] manager that's like this high of an expectation person. And it just feels really stressful. But
[03:07] I've had these managers and I feel like they're that's when I've learned the most and leveled
[03:11] up the most is having someone that gave me had really high expectations and then helped me understand
[03:17] here's where you're not doing as well as you can. I know you can do better go back and work on this.
[03:22] Like I know that sounds annoying, but I think in practice it ends up helping you most in your
[03:25] career. I imagine you've seen a similar result. I think so. I mean, you'd have to ask some of
[03:33] the people on my team. So I might look at it differently than they look at it. It's a hard
[03:39] skill because it's not always easy to give feedback, especially if you feel like you know,
[03:43] someone's put a lot of effort into something. And so I give a lot of thought to how I deliver
[03:49] that feedback. So it feels like we're on the same team. And I'm trying to help them be successful,
[03:55] not to help encourage failure. And that's where I think that third piece of the framework of jumping
[04:02] into help can make people feel like I'm in a safe space. My manager wants me to be successful. My
[04:08] manager's helping me here. And I do often do that behind the scenes. So maybe that's another
[04:16] flavor of this, which is I don't do it live in the big meeting in front of all the people where
[04:22] the presentation doesn't go very well. I do it afterwards where it feels like a safer space to
[04:28] say, here's a way this could have gone better. Let's think about this differently next time.
[04:34] So it gives people a little grace and a little bit of an ability to absorb that feedback without
[04:42] feeling like it's kind of on a stage.
