============================================================

[00:00] be successful. One of the main reasons companies focus so much on churn and retention is
[00:04] because it costs them a lot of money to drive new customers and users. I imagine there's an almost
[00:10] an implied it's really cheap for you all to find new customers because of maybe the brand and word
[00:14] of mouth. Is that true? I think that definitely has some dynamics. I think the bigger factor
[00:19] is the monetization model. For most SaaS companies, they're making from a subscription,
[00:23] right? They're paying 29 bucks a month is the only way that they're going to really monetize.
[00:28] Whereas our business works, you have folks who are paying a subscription, but as folks get bigger
[00:34] because we're monetizing on that GMV that that merchant is producing, the revenue the merchant
[00:39] is producing in the form of payments and other services, it allows us to grow with the merchant
[00:46] in those really successful merchants, make the whole system work well.
[00:51] Got it. So basically your net dollar retention or net revenue retention is just absurd
[00:55] for the winners and it makes up for all the losers slash losers, people that have tried to
[01:00] build it online. Yes, try and haven't been first discussed. When you think of the other parallel
[01:04] is an angel investing, right? Most of angel investments are not going to work out,
[01:09] but the couple that do make that entire investment cut a portfolio successful.
[01:17] With retention not being the primary goal and the metric you guys focus on optimizing,
[01:24] how do you know if you're doing well? Is it some number of these winners have to come out every
[01:28] quarter of a year? How do you think about progress and achieving and success basically for growth?
[01:34] Just thinking about a cohort of users we acquire in a given time period, say a quarter.
[01:40] And then over the next year, two years, three years, four years, five years,
[01:44] how much GMV have those merchants produced in total? Not on a per merchant basis,
[01:51] but in total, did that cohort generate GMV? And if they generate GMV, that will translate into
[01:56] revenue and gross profit in all of those things that we can then use to reinvest in growing
[02:01] business. So it's really looking at the total value, but on that GMV basis, and GMV is a power
[02:07] law based metric. And so it's really that power law that drives the success of each cohort.
[02:13] Again, going back to investing, same thing there, each vintage from a fund,
[02:18] how much did that return? Kind of, it's a fund that is really driven by the few, if you really...
