============================================================

[00:00] Some of the best startup advice I've heard is startups should focus on one thing and be really,
[00:05] really exceptionally world-class at that one thing. And one of our early zigs is we are going to do
[00:09] exactly the opposite of that. You have no direct reports and I don't believe you've ever had
[00:14] direct reports at outspot. I could become passively okay at management with some training,
[00:19] with some coaching. I don't want to spend any years of my life becoming passively okay at
[00:23] something. What was that process like to define the culture? My co-founder and I were having
[00:27] a lot of our founders meetings and he said, oh, Darmesh, I hear this culture thing is really
[00:30] important. By the way, can you go do that? I'm like, okay, right. All the people and all of me is like,
[00:35] I am like the worst possible person is not that I don't like people. I just don't like being around
[00:39] them a whole lot. Something that's really unique and interesting about you is you're obsessed
[00:42] with comedy and keynote crap. It comes down to this metric that stand-up comedians use called
[00:47] LPM laughs per minute. I have custom software that I've written that will say, okay, here
[00:51] are the points at which the audience laughed. Today, my guest is Darmesh Shah. Darmesh is the
[01:00] co-founder and CTO of HubSpot and also one of the most fascinating and first principled thinkers I've
[01:06] ever met. In our conversation, we cover a lot of ground. Darmesh's hilarious and ingenious
[01:11] approach to putting together a talk, including measuring laughs per minute, his biggest lessons
[01:16] from being a public company exec for over 10 years now, especially while being a startup
[01:20] guy at heart, how he approached creating and scaling the culture of HubSpot,
[01:25] which you'll find both hilarious and inspiring, why founders and product teams are all fighting
[01:30] the second law of thermodynamics at a zig while everyone else is zagging, how and why Darmesh
[01:36] leans into his strengths, including never having a single direct report during his 18 years of
[01:41] running HubSpot and so much more. This episode is so fun and will expand your mind in many
[01:47] ways. With that, I bring you Darmesh Shah after a short word from our sponsors. And if you enjoy
