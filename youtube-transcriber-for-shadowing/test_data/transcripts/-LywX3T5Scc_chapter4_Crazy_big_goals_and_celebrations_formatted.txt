This makes me think about the concept of an "ugly baby" from the book *Creativity Inc.* by Ed Catmull. He talks about how new ideas are like this ugly baby that nobody wants to look at or deal with—like, he says they want to kill it. I don't know why you would do that with an ugly baby, but these ideas are very soft and fragile. It's really important not to kill them early and to give them a chance to survive. What I'm hearing here is to have this big vision that many people might think is completely absurd. I love this idea! But here's one step we could take to see if this could be a reality.

I completely agree. That very first step, at the far end of chaos, is often quite embarrassing. You're like, "I have this idea that is so big and so wild, and how on earth would I do that?" At that point, you don't have mastery; you don't have all the answers. In fact, you likely have none of the answers, but you just have this idea that you think would be cool. Ideally, you want the idea to be so cool that you're willing to work really hard to will it into existence. One of the key parts is not only having the idea but thinking it's so cool that you're going to work for years to make it happen.

Actually, Melissa did a really amazing pitch deck recently about her vision for a space. I won't go into the details right here, but I was really excited about it. The great thing about a pitch deck is that it allows other people to see your thinking, and your thinking actually gets clarified as you go through that process. I talked to Melissa and a bunch of other people who have worked at Canva, and something else I heard along these lines is this phrase, "crazy big goals," which I think is one of your values. I love that as a value. Why is that so important? How does that fit into this? Just talk about the power of having crazy big goals.

Yes! Right from the start of Canva, we had a truly crazy big goal. We wanted to empower the world to design, taking all these complicated things and putting them into one platform to make it accessible to everyone. Rather than being super expensive and unaffordable, we wanted to empower everyone everywhere in the world to design. That was the epitome of a crazy big goal. If we macro out even further, we have this two-step plan: build one of the world's most valuable companies and do the most good we can do. Again, a rather crazy big goal.

What I love about a crazy big goal is that you feel completely inadequate before it. Another crazy big goal we have is to see everyone's basic human needs met on the planet—completely crazy big! It truly shouldn't be the case, and it's absolutely absurd, but we can delve into that later. With a crazy big goal, you want to work really hard to will it into existence. If you start with a reasonable or realistic goal, you might reach it and think, "Oh, cool, whatever." More importantly, when problems and roadblocks come along, as they always do, you might just decide to choose another course. A crazy big goal is both ambitious and something you think is incredibly important, so you actually want to will it into existence because it requires so much work.

Is there a crazy big goal that you set that comes to mind as a good example of what I'm talking about—maybe a product you launched or featured back in the day? 

Absolutely! We have a mission to empower the world to design, which we break down into mission pillars. This includes empowering everyone to design anything with every ingredient in every language on every device—obviously a mouthful! We take successive goals every year towards this mission. For designing anything, we started with social media and presentations, and now we have docs, websites, whiteboards, and video. Every year, we're launching more to fulfill that part of our mission.

Equally, for every language, we started in English, then Spanish, then 20 languages, then 100 languages, including hard languages like Arabic, Hebrew, and Urdu. Now, we're in over 100 languages and are really focusing on the localization experience to make it feel truly local in every market around the world. You can see how having these very big audacious goals, which we take step by step, helps us will them into existence. For every device, we started with a web platform, then launched our iPad app, iPhone, and Android. We spent years investing in cross-platform capabilities to ensure the same feature set across every device. 

I see how all this is starting to fit together. There's this big, crazy ambitious vision, and below that are the mission pillars feeding into this vision, along with the crazy big goals within each of those pillars to measure your progress toward all these components of the mission.

Exactly! With all that in mind, there's also a trade-off you have to make regarding how ambitious you get. Oftentimes, people miss these very ambitious goals. How do you find that balance between being ambitious and crazy, but still doable enough so people don't get discouraged?

With a crazy big goal, we've been really great at achieving them. The timeframe for achieving them hasn't always been reliable. We haven't been very accurate with timing, but it's interesting to look back at a vision deck we made in 2021 for 2026. It was fascinating to see how much we've actually achieved from that vision deck and how many things are still in flight. We might think things will take six months, and they take a year. Sometimes, we think something will take our entire lifetime, and frankly, I don't even know if we can ever achieve them. But they're such important goals that even if you make a little step in their direction, they're worthwhile nonetheless.

Whether you like them or not, Elon Musk is similar in that he sets really ambitious goals and often misses the timeline, but it clearly works out in achieving the crazy things he has accomplished. 

Something else I hear is that you celebrate these goals in a really unique way. Can you talk about that?

When we have these crazy big goals, we couple them with fun celebrations. We try to make achieving these goals a moment in time, so when we achieve them, we can celebrate. If you're always trying to climb to the top of the mountain without taking a moment to pat yourself on the back, it can feel arduous. Over the years, we've had all sorts of fun celebrations—smashed Greek plates, released doves, and held little festivals. These moments allow the team to celebrate huge achievements.

When we achieve a crazy big goal, like launching in Spanish or hitting 100 languages, we take the time to acknowledge it. We say, "Hey, we did this thing! That thing that seemed really hard, we've now achieved." Each of the different mission pillars represents a long-term investment that will take time to reach. Celebrating each rung along the way is extraordinarily important. It motivates everyone to work hard to bring these goals to life and gives everyone a moment to feel proud of themselves.

It would be very motivating to break a bunch of plates! I really like that idea. We need to bring that one back; we haven't done that in a while. 

I just love how concrete you're making this. Set these crazy big goals, identify the components of the goals, set numbers, and then figure out the steps you take to achieve them.
