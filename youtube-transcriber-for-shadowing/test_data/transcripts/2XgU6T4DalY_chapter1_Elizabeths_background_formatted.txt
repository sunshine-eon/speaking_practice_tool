Chapter 1: Elizabeth’s background
Video: How Netflix builds a culture of excellence | Elizabeth Stone (CTO)
Time: 00:00 - 04:36
============================================================

We can't really have any of the other aspects of the culture, including candor, learning, seeking excellence and improvement, freedom and responsibility if you don't start with high talent density. In some ways, it's very reflective of Reed Hastings as founder of Netflix. When he founded Netflix and grew the company over time, it was with a belief that there could be a different approach to building a company that would make it a place where people thrived, loved being, and felt different than other places. This was not only about the quality of talent density but, even more importantly, about the excellence and the outcomes that would provide people with a sense of fulfillment. This philosophy is deeply seated at Netflix from its original days.

In order to achieve this, you have to really hold yourself to a lot of standards that don't feel like natural human behavior. Today, my guest is Elizabeth Stone. Elizabeth is the Chief Technology Officer at Netflix and, as far as I can tell, the first economist to ever be named CTO at a Fortune 500 company. Prior to this role, Elizabeth was Vice President of Data and Insights. Before Netflix, she held positions such as Vice President of Science at Lyft, COO at Nuna, a trader at Merrill Lynch, and an economist at Analyst Group.

In our conversation, we cover a lot of ground. We discuss how an economics background has helped Elizabeth in her career and why she expects to see more economists rise in the ranks of tech companies. She shares some of her secret sauce for rising so quickly at so many companies so consistently. We delve into Netflix's very unique culture of high talent density, radical candor, and freedom and responsibility. 

We also talk about the structure that Netflix has for their data and user research teams, which she believes is part of Netflix's secret to success. Additionally, we explore what biking and triathlons have taught Elizabeth about life and how she brings those lessons into her work.
