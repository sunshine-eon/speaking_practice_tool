============================================================

[00:00] So essentially just getting very detailed and very concrete with the product
[00:04] experience that you're building. Thinking about the user experience. Sounds like a
[00:08] lot of work. I can't imagine you do this often. Is the advice here to do this once
[00:14] a year or once and just kind of keep it updated? Sounds like you did this at
[00:18] Swiggy and that was a really impactful way of building the product. Yeah, I
[00:22] think this is not only like one way at Swiggy. I think like I recommend this.
[00:25] Every product manager to do a show don't tell version of their current
[00:28] version. And at the same time, this is a new version all the time. So they can
[00:32] compare contrast and very easily kind of explain everyone why they're doing
[00:36] something. In fact, that wall sits called the wall. It also becomes one common
[00:40] place where you can get all the stakeholders in because it becomes
[00:43] instead of just doing the elevator pitch, you can actually do detail
[00:46] discussions on why I'm choosing this versus something else and so on so
[00:49] forth. That's a product managers version of doing this is also product
[00:52] leaders version of doing this learning, which is a cycle strategy on a page.
[00:56] And a lot of people call it like growth loops. Like don't show a user
[01:00] journey. Let's see the entire strategy of the company together on one
[01:05] page. Alright, this is what the market looks like. And why will we get what
[01:09] kind of users and what is our activation budgets and how how many of
[01:14] them are we going to get to this next stage and get them to use it? How
[01:17] will we get them to cross pollination to different sections? Do we need
[01:20] a membership program? Are there any different levers which will press
[01:23] more or less and so on? So that also is like a short on tell. And not
[01:28] only one, but usually I like to create three of them as well. Like why
[01:32] would we choose a strategy versus the other? And that for example, is
[01:36] like a very good way for product leaders to kind of get to one
[01:40] strategy that their CXOs align with and something that they can
[01:45] essentially tell the entire product and other teams. This is
[01:48] what we're going to follow.
