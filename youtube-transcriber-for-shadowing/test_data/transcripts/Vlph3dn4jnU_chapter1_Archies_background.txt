Time: 00:00 - 02:30
============================================================

[00:00] When you have teams naturally break up the world into different funnel stages or different
[00:05] points in the journey, it gets very seductive to just look at my part of the funnel and what's
[00:11] my conversion rate through that part of the funnel, right? And then the team starts to optimize
[00:16] for that conversion rate as their north star. But in practice, it's actually almost always
[00:21] easier to just make it harder to do the thing right before your step in the funnel
[00:26] to increase your conversion rate. Instead of I'm trying to convert a bunch of people,
[00:30] I just want more people to get activated. And then once you start thinking that way,
[00:33] you realize actually the best way to get more people to get to a step is just get more people
[00:39] in the door in the first place. That will always hurt your conversion rate,
[00:42] but it may actually give you more people on the outside.
[00:48] Today my guest is Archie Abrams. Archie is VP of product and head of growth at Shopify,
[00:53] where he leads an org of over 600 people across product, design, engineering, data,
[00:58] ops and growth marketing. Shopify is both an incredibly unique and also an incredibly
[01:04] successful business. And they do things very differently. And as a result, there's a lot
[01:09] that we can learn from how they approach building product and driving growth.
[01:12] Some examples include their priorities and product roadmap are driven by a 100 year
[01:17] vision that comes from Toby, the CEO, and the core product teams don't have metrics or
[01:22] KPIs. They're essentially banned and instead decisions are made based on taste and intuition
[01:27] and building towards this longterm vision. Also the growth team optimizes for churn,
[01:33] which is unlike any other company I've ever come across. And once you hear why,
[01:37] this will make a lot of sense. Also, they keep longterm holdouts for every experiment they run.
[01:42] And they automatically look at the impact these experiments have had on the business
[01:46] a year later, two years later and three years later, and then revisit these
[01:50] decisions down the road. And in our conversation, we dig into all of this,
[01:54] plus how Shopify organizes the growth team, how they run experiments, how the growth team
[01:59] collaborates with the product team, how they measure impact, plus Archie shares a bunch of
[02:04] very specific and interesting examples of changes that have driven growth for the business.
[02:09] And so much more, this is such a fascinating conversation. And I know this will give you
[02:13] a lot to think about in terms of how you run and organize your own product and growth teams.
