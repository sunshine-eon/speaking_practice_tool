============================================================

[00:00] If I were to ask people who are the most inspiring leaders in tech and in business in general,
[00:04] I think you'd be right near the top of that list.
[00:07] You've been through a lot of ups and downs.
[00:09] You've learned a lot of lessons along the way.
[00:12] What have you found has been most helpful to helping you continue to grow and keep up
[00:17] with the business, the way the business has grown, the scale, and just to take on this
[00:20] leadership role?
[00:21] Is it like coaching?
[00:22] Is it reading?
[00:23] Is it other mentors?
[00:24] Something along those lines.
[00:27] You asked really good questions.
[00:28] And by with thank you.
[00:29] I, um, I'll share a few thoughts.
[00:32] I was, I was with Sam Altman probably a few weeks ago at dinner and I told him, yeah,
[00:37] I still feel like I have a lot to prove.
[00:39] I haven't made it yet.
[00:40] And he was really surprised.
[00:42] He's like, what are you talking about?
[00:45] And I didn't even realize that he thought that was an absurd notion.
[00:49] But I said, no, I haven't made it yet.
[00:51] It's not to say I'm not grateful or I feel like I need to get somewhere so that therefore
[00:57] I'll feel like worthy.
[00:59] But I have this still, this kind of beginner's mindset that the bigger I get, the more a
[01:06] beginner I tend to feel.
[01:08] It's like a weird feeling.
[01:09] I think like when you, when I first took off, I think I thought I would like maybe like
[01:13] I knew everything or I knew more than I certainly did.
[01:17] But then you get past some peak.
[01:19] We go into this proffer, you realize, oh my God, the moment you get to some frontier
[01:25] of knowledge, you start to become a beginner again and everything is new.
[01:30] And so I think the first thing I try to do is to be a beginner.
[01:34] You know, Pablo Picasso had a saying, he said, it took me four years to learn to paint like
[01:38] Raphael, but a lifetime to learn to paint like a child.
[01:42] And so I've tried to always see the world through the eyes of a child.
[01:45] And I think one of the key characteristics of a child is curiosity, to see everything
[01:51] with fresh eyes, to not have too many judgments.
[01:55] When I was trying to figure out how to run the company, I studied the history of division
[01:58] organizations and I studied Steve Jobs, but also studied like what Bill Gates did.
[02:03] And I studied like Alfred Sloan at General Motors that MIT Sloan is named after.
[02:08] And actually the founding of divisional companies, which I believe was DuPont, they were making
[02:13] powder for gunpowder.
[02:16] The war ends.
[02:17] What do you do with powder?
[02:18] Turns out powder can be used for paint, but the way you sell gunpowder and paint are different
[02:23] sales channels.
[02:24] So they created what we now know as the divisional structure.
[02:27] So I try to like understand the sources of things.
[02:32] I try to learn.
[02:33] I try to be shameless about reaching out to help.
[02:37] I think that a lot of people are afraid to reach out to help because they think other
[02:40] people are busy.
[02:42] The biggest honor most people get in their lives or one of the biggest honor is when
[02:46] other people ask them for help, because we all just want to feel useful.
[02:50] So don't feel ashamed to reach out to something for help.
[02:53] It actually like it gives a lot of them great honor.
[02:57] And I think you don't need to reach out to people 10 years ahead of you.
[03:00] They can just be people a year ahead of you.
[03:03] In fact, an entrepreneur getting started, I might be less youthful than somebody two
[03:07] years ahead of them that knows like the latest distribution channels that I like kind of
[03:13] have forgotten.
[03:15] So I think that that is the key.
[03:16] It's learning.
[03:17] It's growing.
[03:18] It's curiosity.
[03:19] It's constantly having that hunger and that fire to always want to be better to remember
[03:26] to feel like I haven't made it yet because the reason I say I haven't made it yet is
[03:32] because if I've made it, then I'm done.
[03:34] And I want to feel like an artist.
[03:36] You know, Bob Dylan used to say an artist has to be in a constant place of becoming.
[03:41] And so long as they don't become something, then they're going to be okay.
[03:46] So you have to always be evolving, learning, growing.
[03:50] And the canvas keeps getting bigger.
[03:53] The mountaintop keeps getting higher.
[03:56] And I feel like I'm just getting started.
[03:59] And I hope that, you know, the panel, I don't know how long you intend to do the podcast,
[04:04] but I intended this for a long time.
[04:05] And if you do or whatever, we'll definitely want to have talks.
[04:09] And I hope years from now, Lenny, I hope 70% of what I said, I still believe.
[04:15] But if 100% of what I say, I still believe that I probably haven't learned very much.
[04:20] And so if 90% I say, I don't believe any more than I'm like, you know, kind of delusional
[04:26] and wrong.
[04:27] But if, but, but I sincerely hope that I retract it or change or modify a few things I said
[04:33] today in a few years, because that will mean that I've gained more wisdom.
[04:37] And so how do I do that by being sure?
