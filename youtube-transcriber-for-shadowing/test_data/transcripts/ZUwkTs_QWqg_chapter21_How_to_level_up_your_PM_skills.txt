[50:39] of what that feels like.
[50:40] To kind of build on that, with PMs that work for you
[50:43] and work with you.
[50:45] When they're looking to get better and build their skills,
[50:48] other than go take some courses on LinkedIn Learning,
[50:51] what do you often recommend they do to help
[50:53] become stronger and better at their job?
[50:55] So first, it is that feeling of, you've got to own your product
[51:00] and you've got to speak up and say, this is where I want to drive it.
[51:02] Because a lot of times I think people are scared to do that
[51:05] or worried about doing that or don't feel that's their actual role.
[51:08] So one it's like extreme clarity on, hey, this is your role,
[51:11] is to own this and take this to the next level.
[51:13] When you start molding the clay, people want to come and help.
[51:17] When you start building something cool, people are like,
[51:18] oh, you did kind of gravitate into it.
[51:20] But until you can start doing that, that's really tough.
[51:22] So one, it's letting people know that's what's expected them.
[51:25] And then two, I would tell people to just build.
[51:29] As crazy as it sounds, I spend a lot of my time on the side
[51:32] just trying to build different things.
[51:33] I mean, they try different clay, think through different ideas.
[51:37] And I think that is a really important skill to have,
[51:40] to just being able to say, OK, I'm going to start with the blank sheet
[51:42] and make some art or whatever it is you want to do.
[51:45] And I encourage people to do that because it's a muscle like anything else, right?
[51:48] You can get a kinetrophy.
[51:50] And I really do think no matter what people,
[51:52] kind of the heart of PM and his that ability to be a builder
[51:55] and you do have to make sure you can keep doing it.
