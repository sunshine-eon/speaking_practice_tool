============================================================

Oh, here's the other thing, Lenny. When you were there, we had a guest team and a host team. We don't have a guest team and hosting anymore; we have a design team, a marketing team, and an engineering team. 

The reason we don't break the app into guests and hosts anymore is because reviews affect both guests and hosts. It turns out that almost everything involves connecting the guests and hosts. When you have separate teams, they tend to have separate roadmaps that go in different directions and become incompatible. 

So, we have product marketers that are responsible for both guest and host aspects. The designers and engineers are fairly fungible; they can move from project to project. We keep some people, especially the product marketing team, focused on specific domain areas. 

Ultimately, we want to ensure that we have designers and engineers covering a much larger surface area, and that's what we do.
