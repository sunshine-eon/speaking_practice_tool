Time: 62:49 - 70:02
============================================================

Dimitri, before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that we haven't touched on that you think might be really helpful for listeners to hear? Maybe a less wisdom nugget that you haven't already shared or even just something to kind of double down on that you've already shared?

No, I think that it was an amazing chat and thanks, Lenya. We covered a lot of different topics. I would just maybe summarize that if you're excited to build certain things, never hesitate to do it. The best way to do it is probably your own startup, and it also what will give you the steepest possible learning curve. But then if you want to join a company, try to choose the one that has the highest entrepreneurial spirit and that will allow you to work as closer to a mode of a founder as you possibly can. It's a recurring theme in these conversations I'm having with companies that produce the PMs that have the steepest career trajectory. And so that advice is exactly what I'm taking away from this too, assuming you want your career to accelerate really quickly after you go work at this company.

Okay, Dimitri, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready? 

Yes, let's go. Here we go. 

Okay, first question. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people? 

The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz. Actually read it quite some time ago, but I found myself recommending it to other product managers most often. It's actually illustrative that to be a great product manager, someone needs to strive to be a great CEO. And besides this book emphasizes the importance of building systematic solutions and scalable solutions which is critical for scaling a company. Also being honest on how important it is to grind stuff. 

And then the second book is, I read it more recently, Built by Tony Fidel. I was really inspired by this one, especially given how I appreciate how it's not easy to build hardware and what Tony was describing there. It's just super exciting and inspiring. And also I think that there are different archetypes of product managers. There are people who tend to disrupt things more. Personally, I think about myself as a builder. So Tony's principles that he highlighted in the book resonate with me a lot. I'm trying to get Tony on the podcast. If anyone listening knows Tony Fidel and can nudge him, hey, say yes to Lenny. That'd be great. I've been in touch with his team. He's not doing podcasts right now, but I'm trying to get him on.

Okay, moving on. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed? 

I think the last movie I watched was Oppenheimer and I really liked it. I always love watching biopics. I think they give you kind of a perspective and let you think about things in perspective. 

Is there a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love? 

Manos is a great thing. 

The AI agent? 

Yeah, yeah. It's just like I was super impressed. I was mesmerized. It's all autonomous and smooth. I just spent a few hours vibe coding and I created this JavaScript app that sends me a rare English word every day to learn and remember. It worked and I was just amazed. 

What's a word you learned? 

Ineffable. It was the year's worth. I love that it's still going. That's great. 

Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful in work and life? 

I love this phrase. I think Eisenhower said it. Plans are worthless, but planning is everything. It's like, you know, we often say how important it is to be flexible and agile and just to have a change in circumstances. But it doesn't allow us to actually not have a plan at all. It's important for us to remember that, you know, we always need to think many steps ahead and while being flexible, we also need to think things thoroughly.

Final question. For folks that are maybe checking out Revolute for the first time that want to play with it already, users, what's the most underrated feature? What's something that you think people should check out? Maybe they're not aware of or even just like a UX, I don't know, animation, something fun that people may not know about. 

The thing that is not yet widely used, but I really loved it, is what we call a wealth protection. So if you go to settings, you can enable a limit for any transfers outside of Revolute. And if you want to do a transfer above this limit, you will have to do a selfie check, which is our proprietary technology. We do a video selfie and it allows us to make sure that it's you, no one else is doing the transfer. And it's actually, it's almost as smooth as Face ID and the way the team built it is really great. I'm really proud of those guys.

Dmitry, you guys are doing something very special. I really appreciate you spending so much time with me chatting through all the things you guys have figured out. I think that's going to help a lot of different companies level up the way they think about product and for people to join Revolute that want to experience this and accelerate their career. So thank you for being here. 

Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out? And how can listeners be useful to you? 

I think the best way is to find me on LinkedIn. And yeah, I would be happy to receive a note from anyone on how we can improve the product and your feedback on the product. And also, if you know someone who can be a great fit to Revolute after you've listened to what I've told, then yeah, I would be grateful for that as well.

Awesome. You're about to get a flood of applications. Get prepared. 

Dmitry, thank you. Look forward to that. 

Yeah. Yeah. Lenny, thanks a lot. It was amazing. Thanks for being here. 

Thank you very much. Same. Bye, everyone. Thanks.
