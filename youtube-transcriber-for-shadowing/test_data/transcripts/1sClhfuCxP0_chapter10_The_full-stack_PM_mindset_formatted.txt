============================================================

One thread I'm pulling out of a few of your stories so far is you often come back to this full stack approach to many models. You talked about how product managers (PMs) are like influencers, but also they're influencing users. It's a cool way of thinking about it with this working backwards process. You can use it to think about the full stack of launch, not just what features you're going to build. I know you also have some strong opinions about product managers and how they should be much more full stack than most PMs. Does that ring a bell? If so, can you talk about that?

Yes. I think it's the same thread that connects the first and the second. Product managers have to own outcomes, not only features and parts of the problem, but they will own some parts of the problem fully. They need to work with everybody to ensure that the eventual product they launch is successful—not only from the point of view of, "Hey, we launched something that works for users," but also in terms of whether it truly changed the behavior of the kind of user that we wanted to achieve a business outcome that builds a capability important for us. All of those things combined will not happen if the product manager is only thinking about their part.

They have to think about external users, competition, other product managers and product leaders, engineering, marketing, and so on. It’s such a diverse field. Unless you are very, very good at that or have built partnerships and run your ideas or product through those people and gotten feedback from them, and finally made a decision around that part, I don't think you'll be very successful. In my opinion, full stack product managers are the ones who are going to be more successful rather than those who are only doing very well in one particular area.

There’s a book called "Range" that I’m sure you may have heard about. Even in the first chapter, they take two examples. One is Roger Federer. Until he was 18, he played a bunch of racquet sports that weren't even tennis. He brought ideas from one racquet sport to another, and then from the second to the third, and so on. This gave him a range of ideas that allowed him to connect a lot more dots and actually ship it. I think that's a better playbook for being more successful in product.

I was just watching a documentary called "Greatness," and it featured Wayne Gretzky. He had a similar experience when he was young. He played hockey only during winter and other sports during summer. Hockey was just one sport he played, and eventually, he started to focus on it. They discussed how people who play different sports in their childhood actually end up being much better than those who choose just one sport.
