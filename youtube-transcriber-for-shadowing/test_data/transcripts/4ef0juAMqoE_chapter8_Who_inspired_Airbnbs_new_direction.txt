============================================================

[00:00] is it was now late 2019.
[00:03] I don't know what to do.
[00:05] I'm like, the product is slow, the app seems not changed,
[00:07] cost arising, I keep adding more people.
[00:10] There seems to be more by politics,
[00:12] by politics I mean advocating for like individual interests
[00:16] rather than the whole of the company.
[00:17] More bureaucracy, meaning like meetings
[00:20] about meetings about meetings and a lot of dependencies.
[00:23] People were describing working 80 hours
[00:25] and getting 20 hours of productive work done,
[00:27] which is like just like a crazy ratio a week.
[00:30] And I didn't really quite know what to do.
[00:33] And then right before the pandemic,
[00:35] I meet two people that really affected
[00:38] how I thought about things.
[00:40] The first is Heroki Asai.
[00:42] Heroki now works at Airbnb.
[00:44] He's one of my executives and actually product design,
[00:47] product marketing design and marketing report into him.
[00:51] And he was a creative director for Apple.
[00:53] So he worked for Steve Jobs,
[00:55] was like basically dotted line to Steve
[00:58] for many, many years, came from Graph Design,
[01:00] eventually ran all of marketing communications
[01:03] and Apple marketing communications,
[01:05] they actually like, they actually designed the app.
[01:07] They made the app.
[01:08] They designed like all the marketing touch points
[01:11] for the store, right?
[01:11] So it wasn't just ads, it was like every brand touch point
[01:15] they were responsible.
[01:16] So everything flowed through marketing.
[01:17] And so marketing became the governing factor
[01:20] that made everything really organized.
[01:22] I met another person or got re-quainted a person
[01:24] named Johnny Ive.
[01:25] And Johnny Ive was the head of industrial design
[01:27] and then chief design officer, Apple.
[01:29] And they described this way of running a company
[01:32] that was totally different than the way that I was running it.
[01:35] It was basically the way that Steve Jobs ran Apple
[01:37] from about 1998 till he died in 2011.
[01:40] Apple somewhat runs it this way today,
[01:42] but the ARV semi-divisional services is turning into
[01:46] division and they are just so big that I think it's,
[01:49] you know, not a one to one anymore,
[01:50] but they are still technically run this way.
[01:53] And I had this image of not being divisional
[01:56] cause we were running like, we had 10 divisions.
[01:58] We had a flights division and, you know,
[02:00] we had a homes division, which was divided to pro hosts
[02:02] and core hosts and Lux.
[02:04] We had business travel and we had like, you know,
[02:06] a magazine and we had experiences and we had.org
[02:09] and we had China.
[02:10] So we had like these 10 different divisions
[02:11] all going in different directions.
[02:13] And I created this culture where everyone
[02:15] would be a business manager and or a, you know,
[02:18] business leader, general manager,
[02:19] which made them want to create many general managers, right?
[02:22] And so the company kept getting subdivided,
[02:24] subdivided, subdivided and not made a very,
[02:26] very difficult to turn in.
[02:28] This was all about me delegating responsibility.
[02:31] The problem is if you're running a divisional company,
[02:34] you're a product like founder,
[02:35] you're kind of, what are you doing?
[02:36] Like strategy, capital allocation,
[02:39] my job went from proactive to very reactive.
[02:41] I was reacting to a lot of things.
[02:43] I was in a lot of meetings,
[02:45] try to adjudicate different issues between
