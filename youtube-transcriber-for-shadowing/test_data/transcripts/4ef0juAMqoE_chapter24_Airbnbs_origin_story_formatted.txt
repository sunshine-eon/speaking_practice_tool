============================================================

And really, Lenny, maybe to surround us with a story because that was a fun fact, but I'm kind of just this is the pre-founding story that I never tell. I don't think I could have ever done what I did if I wasn't an industrial designer. I think industrial designers are different than graphic designers. Because as an industrial designer, you have to actually understand engineering in your training. You have to work with mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, and you have to understand manufacturing. Industrial design is very accountable to sales. If you design a building as an architect, and that office building doesn't get leased, the architect is usually not on the hook for it. But if you're an industrial designer and you design a product that doesn't sell, you're kind of on the hook for it; at least people assume you didn't design a good product. So you also have to understand marketing and strategy. And so that became this gateway.

But I didn't really want to make items and objects my whole life. At RISD, the biggest value I got, in addition to learning industrial design, was I met my co-founder, Joe Gebbia. On the day of graduation, Joe looked at me and said, "Brian, I think we're going to start a company together one day." I had no idea what he was referring to. So I moved to Los Angeles, where I worked as an industrial designer for two years, when one day I got a package in the mail that changed my life. I opened this package, and it was a sea cushion with a handle on it, along with a letter from Joe, my friend from RISD. He said, "I started a company in San Francisco, and all these people are starting companies. You should come here." This was in 2007. YouTube had just come out, and I was finally able to see all these Steve Jobs keynotes on YouTube. I didn't know who he was; I had never heard his voice before YouTube. Apple had this renaissance, Google was on fire, and Facebook was taking off. It felt like the gears of the world that were turning were in San Francisco.

So one day, I went into work and quit my job. My boss was dumbfounded. I packed everything into the old backseat of my old Honda Civic and drove to San Francisco. Joe told me the rent was $1,150, and I didn't have enough money to pay the rent. A design conference came to San Francisco, and all the hotels were sold out. We thought, "What if we turned our house into a bed and breakfast for the design conference?" I didn't have any beds, but Joe had three beds. We called it Air Bed and Breakfast. 

So my fun fact was that I was an artist and designer before Airbnb—really an artist, at least how I thought about it. I think that's maybe one of the things that makes Airbnb different because there aren't a lot of designers or artists running Fortune 500 or S&P 500 companies. I think that intuition, imagination, design, and curiosity are qualities we need more of. By the way, I think everyone listening has these qualities. But I think that a lot of companies are like a body that's cut off at the head. They're just some body from the heart and are often really biased towards one side of their head. Some of the greatest scientists played musical instruments, like Einstein. I think that being a whole, well-rounded thinker is good.

So anyways, that's my final thought. I love that fun fact because it almost explains everything you've been talking about, which is rethinking the way companies can run and doing things super differently. I really appreciate you sharing that. I also love that it transitions into the creation story of Airbnb, which happens a lot at Airbnb. People hear that story over and over because it's so interesting and so important. 

Brian, I know you have to run. Thank you so much for being here and being generous with your time. 

Thank you, Lenny. And congratulations on everything you're doing.
