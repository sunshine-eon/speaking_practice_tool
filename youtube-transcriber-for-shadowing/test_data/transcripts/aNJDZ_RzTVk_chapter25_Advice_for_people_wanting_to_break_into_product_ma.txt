============================================================

[00:00] from college to consulting to my foreign to tech was really into more like solutions analysts.
[00:06] I think that was my title. I was basically trying to implement like a large B2B software in
[00:12] national banks. And how I got into product management was really around understanding
[00:18] deeply the customer and understanding deeply the product and being able to show impact
[00:24] on the combination of these two things. Typically, the folks that joined product
[00:29] teams are the highest performers outside of product that either understand the customer
[00:34] really well and can advise product or understand the product very well and can serve customers.
[00:39] And so my advice is for folks that want to break into that is to find a role that is
[00:45] adjacent to product that enables you to have those experiences and to prove yourself.
[00:51] So for example, product operations is a good one, business operations is a good one,
[00:56] more consulting the sales engineering or solution engineering is a good one.
[01:01] There are designers and engineers that can become PMs as well. Typically, it's folks that can do
[01:08] the job as well as the PM. And what we typically do is we give those PMs a shot or those folks
[01:16] a shot. So we'd give them like six months to go into a new area and try it out.
[01:22] And then we basically have the engineers they work with and designers they work with
[01:26] actually make the call as to whether or not they would want this PM versus another PM on the team.
[01:32] Is there anything else you want to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?
[01:36] Yeah, first thing from first principles, don't take everything I'm saying at face value.
[01:41] And second is back to talent that a huge part of our success was the early
[01:49] team that Karim built on the tech side. And so I can write blogs all day on how we increase
[01:56] velocity. But if there's one thing to take away from this is that empowered and talented engineers
[02:02] and designers are the biggest reason why Ramp was so successful. And it's something that requires
[02:10] a ton of focus. Early on for the first year at Ramp, Karim or CTO was only focused on that.
[02:18] It was hiring the best talent. He was a lot less interested or focused on our product strategy
[02:24] or product market fit or even our revenue. It was all about bringing in the best engineers and the
[02:29] best designers. And that has had compounding effects on the company of the team.
[02:35] And I think an important element there is the initial people you hire end up impacting
[02:40] the next batch in the next set because they see, wow, this person is working at Ramp.
[02:45] That's incredible. I got to look at that. So there's an early compounding effect too that happens.
[02:50] Exactly. Well, with that, we reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions
[02:56] for you. Are you ready? Yes. What is what are two or three books you've recommended most to
[03:03] other people?
