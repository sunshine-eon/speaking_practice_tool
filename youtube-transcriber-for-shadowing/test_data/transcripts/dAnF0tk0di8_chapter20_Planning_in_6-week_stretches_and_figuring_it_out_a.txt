============================================================

[00:00] It's clear that you've designed your life and designed your business in this very intentional way because the default path
[00:07] And I'll kind of reference this back to this other podcast episode the default path is build a company raise a bunch of money build massive
[00:14] Business generate a lot of revenue exit try something else and you've done something very different
[00:19] Can I speak up to that though because like this is the pathless path stuff was this kind of what that was?
[00:25] Yeah, so so I'm moderately familiar with that idea
[00:28] I didn't listen to that that podcast, but I saw some clips
[00:31] So I find it interesting because you know like you know you've designed your way at your life intentionally, but
[00:38] It's funny because there's some principles. I hold perhaps or some direction
[00:43] I'm headed, but I don't think about any of this ahead of time
[00:45] So I'm very much in turn including the company like we don't have a
[00:50] Multi-year plan. I don't even have a one-year plan or even have a six month plan or a court
[00:53] Like we think about everything we're gonna do every six weeks every six weeks
[00:57] We rethink what we're gonna do next so we're very much in in the now company making it up as we go
[01:03] And this is true for me personally my career the whole thing. I didn't have any of this planned out
[01:08] I didn't decide I wanted to be like this or like that
[01:11] I just figure out what works and
[01:14] Keep doing that until it doesn't and then maybe we do something else, but it's very much
[01:18] Not I'm not on a path. I'm not on a
[01:22] There's no I can't see the path. I'm on a path. We're all on some we're going somewhere
[01:27] I don't want to stand still, but I don't know where I'm going and I'm perfectly comfortable with that
[01:31] So for me, it is really much about making it up as you go
[01:35] Based on you know again being in touch with like how things feel to you
[01:39] What your intuition is what your gut tells you what makes you happy?
[01:42] What do you want to do?
[01:43] What can you do sometimes things that make you happy you can't do just because like life is what it is
[01:48] So understanding that and figuring out what the trade-offs are
[01:51] But really it's it's figuring out as we go and I'm I think frankly, it's the best way to run a business
[01:56] I think it's it's the healthiest most honest
[02:00] Way to run a business which is to figure it out as you go
[02:03] I think the further out you plan
[02:06] The less you know about the decisions you're making and by the time you get there
[02:10] You're probably gonna be wrong or you're gonna want to do something else
[02:13] And then if you're like don't do those things and that's what's the point of planning
[02:16] So people end up doing things they don't want to do because they said they were gonna do them
[02:20] Obligations in the future. I think are quite dangerous
[02:23] And and I think they send people down a path of unhappiness actually
[02:27] So I think just staying closer to now is that probably the best way to do it
[02:30] And a lot of this trickles down from the biggest decision you made which is don't raise money keep control of this business
[02:37] This is you're the boss. There's no boss above you. Yeah, the independence like if you go to 37 signals calm
[02:43] There's 37 ideas and the first one there's a zero zero which is start here
[02:48] Which is like a read me but the oh one is independence
[02:51] Independence is the root of all the things we're able to do and we did make that a just intentional decision
[02:57] We didn't know all you know all the tentacles that come up from that and what it's gonna impact and touch
[03:02] But we knew principally but like we want to be able to do what we want to do
[03:06] We're we want to be entrepreneurs and to me that means working for yourself and
[03:11] The moment you go out and take money or have these big obligations
[03:14] You end up working for someone else and I don't really understand
[03:17] I do understand why some companies do it, but I don't understand why a lot of people do it
[03:22] Who probably shouldn't do it. I think staying independent is a wonderfully
[03:28] fulfilling
[03:31] Experience and it's very hard to do when you're beholden to someone else's time frame and expectations
[03:38] So another thing we rarely have here are expectations
[03:41] This is the point like we launch a new product. I
[03:45] Don't know what's gonna happen like we launched base camp. I didn't know it's gonna have we launched
[03:48] Hey, I didn't know it's gonna happen. We're gonna launch some new stuff soon. I don't know what's gonna happen
[03:52] We don't say like if this gets 20,000 users, then it is six
[03:56] I don't know we don't care. It doesn't even matter
[03:59] We're making it anyway, and we're gonna see what's gonna happen the market will tell us what happens
[04:04] I'll just wait to find out. There's no sense in spending the time thinking about what could be
