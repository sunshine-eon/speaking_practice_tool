[00:00] Anyway, it's so interesting, like I love all these different, these elements you're pointing
[00:04] out of how different building in India is that I think people in the US have no idea
[00:07] about. And so I appreciate you getting into all these little elements. Is there anything
[00:13] else around the Indian market that may surprise people before we go in a different direction
[00:16] about building a startup there?
[00:18] For all the challenges, India remains the most promising market that one can be building
[00:23] for right now because everything is going our way. We have all sorts of digital public
[00:27] infrastructure, government support, all these great people doing extraordinary things. Apart
[00:35] from the Twitter noise and Twitter is designed for our trades getting likes. So I wouldn't
[00:41] read too much into it, but I think all of us are doing well because we have an audience
[00:47] set and a world ecosystem that is fully supporting us and really taking it forward. So I think
[00:53] I wouldn't want to be anywhere else in building because of this extremely vibrant, crazy opportunity
[01:00] that one can learn from. However, I wish I often wish that I wish I could get a one month
[01:06] internship with Brian and learn how to do things. And I've never had the luxury I
[01:12] can only watch his podcast with you to learn a few things. But what if I got a chance
[01:16] to be there and I missed that part where I've never been really trained by these
[01:22] extraordinary product brains or even observe them make decisions. So I recently posted one
[01:28] thing that the word operation theater comes because operating used to be a public process
[01:34] and people used to pay money to watch surgeries and see all the bloody gory stuff even before
[01:39] anesthesia was born. And there's so much joy in seeing somebody do their action. And
[01:46] I wish there was theater for Brian, take a product decision, take a hard call on killing
[01:52] a product or seeing Tim rejecting all the ideas that they have to before the GTM of a
[02:00] product. I think we could benefit so much from that. And unfortunately, it remains in
[02:05] very small circles. And like I said, I believe I said, you do a fabulous job of
[02:09] removing some of the information asymmetry and kind of making it more democratic. But
[02:13] there is so much more that we all could learn. And I feel extremely envious to many people
[02:21] who have the opportunity to kind of work with the best of the best, because many of us
[02:24] from India never had the luxury. We had to figure out everything on our own.
[02:29] Wow, how cool would that be? Just to have a camera in some of those meetings, just as a
[02:33] learning experience, because like very few people are in those rooms. And there's so much to
[02:39] learn. I think though people will find, holy shit, this one, this is how decisions are
[02:44] made, what is going on. And two is like, I don't want to work for this person. This
[02:49] sounds very difficult and stressful. Those are probably some takeaways.
