============================================================

[00:00] And that's where we refer to the Keeper's Test, which is really just a mental framing
[00:06] to make sure we hold ourselves accountable for this.
[00:09] Where if I'm asking myself the question, if this person on my team came to me and said,
[00:15] I'm leaving today, I have a different opportunity and I would like to take it, would I do everything
[00:20] I could to keep them at Netflix?
[00:23] If not, then I should be having that tough conversation about, should you really be here?
[00:29] Are you in the right role?
[00:30] If I might be a little bit relieved if you said you were leaving.
[00:34] And the reason the Keeper's Test and that question is useful is because no one wants
[00:38] to think that way.
[00:40] It's very hard to say to someone, I think this isn't the right fit.
[00:43] I think you should move on from the company.
[00:45] So we have to introduce some of those reflections in order to encourage the behavior.
[00:52] And we also then want to get to a place where when you're having that tough conversation,
[00:58] you aren't surprised by it.
[00:59] That is easier said than done.
[01:01] But you can only get to that conversation around, I don't think Netflix and you are
[01:06] the right fit for one another if you've been giving feedback along the way.
[01:11] And so it feels like in its most ideal state, it's a mutual observation in practice.
[01:18] It's not always that smooth.
[01:20] Obviously, we are humans.
[01:22] But that all feeds on itself in order to make sure that we're really holding ourselves
[01:27] to what we say are our behavioral norms as part of the culture.
[01:32] How is that operationalized?
[01:33] Is that just like a mental model that you should have in mind?
[01:36] Or is it like every quarter you should go through this exercise as a part of the performance
[01:40] review process?
[01:41] How does that actually operationalize the Netflix?
[01:44] It's definitely a mental model.
[01:46] So when we talk to managers about what does it mean to be a manager at Netflix, it would
[01:51] mean you should be with some frequency asking yourself this about the people on your team.
[01:57] People ask me frequently, am I passing your keeper test?
[02:02] So it becomes part of a regular manager, direct report one on one.
[02:10] And it is just another way of saying, am I meeting your expectations?
[02:13] What's going well?
[02:14] What's not going well?
[02:15] How are you thinking about things?
[02:18] And that can sometimes be a very awkward conversation to have.
[02:21] So in the middle of a lot of like, we have to talk about this project or that deliverable
[02:25] or this thing that's happening to take the time to step back and just say, how am I doing?
[02:31] Can feel loaded sometimes.
[02:34] And the keeper test, while it feels like a very heavy concept creates a lightness around
[02:38] being able to have that conversation regularly.
[02:42] So we do operationalize it.
[02:44] A point that you made, I'll just clarify, we don't have performance reviews.
[02:49] So we don't have a practice that a lot of other companies do where we would think about
[02:55] reflecting on like a rating of how things are going.
[02:58] We do have an annual cycle of 360 feedback where you request and receive feedback from
[03:04] a lot of people, but it's not an input to some output.
[03:08] It's just for the value of the feedback and to make sure we're keeping that muscle.
[03:12] And we have an annual compensation cycle where we reflect on how are people doing.
[03:18] And so you think about performance as part of both promotions and as part of compensation.
[03:25] But in that way, it has to be part of the day-to-day and part of the operating rhythm
[03:31] because we don't create a process where that would come to the surface.
[03:34] Interesting.
[03:35] I didn't know that.
[03:36] So the idea there is just ongoing, like the whole.
[03:38] So what many people dream of, no performance reviews, we will give you ongoing, real time
[03:42] feedback.
[03:43] We don't have to wait six months.
[03:45] I feel like people talk about this, but very rarely do this.
[03:49] But that's how you guys operate.
[03:51] In ideal.
[03:52] In ideal, yeah.
[03:53] In practice, it's like you have to keep reminding yourself, this is our ideal because it's really
[03:59] easy to rely on the annual 360 cycle.
[04:02] And all of a sudden I might get, I do get about 300 pieces of feedback.
[04:08] And some of those things are on things that happened six months ago.
[04:11] And I think, oh, I wish you had told me this at the time.
[04:14] That would have been more living the Netflix culture.
[04:17] So we have to push ourselves to do it that way.
[04:20] But yeah, that is if working well, it's very timely, direct feedback.
[04:25] The 360 cycle is sort of the annual check-in on, let me get the full picture.
[04:31] Let me be able to distill some themes.
[04:33] Let me tee it up for a conversation with my manager.
[04:36] And then it does remove the sort of crutch of an every six month performance review or
[04:44] something like that.
[04:45] When you talked about this example of someone asking you often, am I meeting your keeper
[04:50] test?
[04:51] It makes me feel like someone's just super nervous.
[04:53] They're like, am I passing your keeper test?
[04:55] And it makes me feel like it could create a culture of just a lot of stress and worry
[05:00] and this hunger games mentality of like I got to compete and worry and I might die or get
[05:05] fired any day.
[05:07] I'm guessing the solution to that is partly cultural.
[05:10] This is just the way we work.
[05:11] You don't need to stress all the time, but you may be let go if you're not meeting this
[05:15] keeper test.
[05:16] How do you avoid this just like constant worry that you might be fired any day and that you
[05:21] may not be hitting the bar?
[05:23] In my personal experience, I have felt a lot more at ease by having these conversations
[05:35] than by not having them.
[05:37] So in many roles I've had, I haven't been sure how I was doing or things I could be doing
[05:45] better on and I didn't quite know how to get that information and that made me feel much
[05:53] more stressed or nervous or at risk than having it be part of the culture to have those conversations.
[06:00] So the thing that I think can be nerve wracking and I feel it myself is the high bar for excellence
[06:07] at Netflix and you're surrounded by, if we're doing this while you're surrounded by amazing
[06:12] people and that can feed a sense of am I doing well enough compared to how everyone else
[06:19] is doing and I know the bar is high for the most part that can drive people and in a good
[06:26] way but in some ways it makes people nervous and that's where I think it's helpful to know
[06:31] we expect to have these conversations so you can just kind of let your shoulders relax
[06:37] a little bit.
[06:38] Yes, the expectations are high but my manager says I'm doing a great job or my manager says
[06:43] I'm not doing a great job but they gave me concrete things that I could do better and
[06:48] so I think knowing is better than not and so in that sense it's the culture combined
[06:53] with the conversations around performance I hope take a little bit of that stress out
[06:58] of it but I've certainly heard it a lot that without that conversation people can be nervous.
[07:04] That's such a good point and such a good example that I feel like every company wants to have
[07:10] a high bar and have only high performers and keep the bar really high for every person
[07:15] they hire.
