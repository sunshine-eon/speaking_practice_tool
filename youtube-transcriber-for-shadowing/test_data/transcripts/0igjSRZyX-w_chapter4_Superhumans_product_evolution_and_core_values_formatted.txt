============================================================

People often overlook the importance of having a genuinely multiplayer or collaborative product. This has been one of the significant evolutions we've taken Superhuman through over the last couple of years. Early last year, we launched what we call Superhuman 2.0. The basic idea behind this update was our observation that almost every notable app had become collaborative by default. Tools like Figma, Notion, and Loom exemplify this trend. Yet, email—the tool we all use more than any other, even more than Slack—remained firmly rooted in its single-player origins.

I want to revisit something you mentioned earlier that I didn’t fully address, which I believe is central to your point: the importance of word of mouth. People often discuss viral features, sharing mechanisms, and contact books, but the reality is that what truly helps a consumer product spread is word of mouth. People sharing their experiences with each other raises the question: how do you facilitate that? We’ll explore various strategies that made Superhuman something people want to share. Ultimately, it boils down to creating something that people genuinely want to share, which is almost the very definition of success in this context.

So, what makes people want to share? It’s about creating something remarkable. You mentioned the concept of remarkableness, which is one of our core company values. When we think about what a company needs to do to grow, it’s essential to create something that people will share. You pointed out one way to achieve this: by making something that people want to share. However, there’s another approach—simply creating something remarkable. This aligns perfectly with our core values at Superhuman.

We focus on creating delight, ensuring that our product brings genuine joy to users. We also aim to deliver remarkable quality—something so striking and compelling that it naturally prompts people to tell others about it. Additionally, we strive to build the extraordinary, which reflects the efficacy and innovativeness of what we create. By embedding these essential ingredients for growth into our company values, we set ourselves up for success. I didn’t realize that remarkableness was one of your core values, but it makes so much sense. We’ll definitely revisit this topic because there’s a wealth of insight to glean from your approach to product development.
