============================================================

Okay, so you talked about being a startup guy. At the same time, HubSpot is approaching its 10 years of being a public company, and I think 18 years since founding. I'm curious about the lessons you've taken from that experience as someone who's clearly a startup person, now being an executive at a very fast-growing and large company. I'm thinking from the perspective of a founder who might be considering starting a company or is in the process of starting one. What advice might you have to share for them, and also for people in executive roles today?

A couple of things come to mind. First, since we are a publicly traded company, I think this doesn't get talked about enough. I'm going to use this platform to get this message out: too many founders are very apprehensive about going public and the IPO process. They think that going public is the beginning of the end, that it will change everything, and that their lives will become miserable. I believe they are over-indexing on what they think it's like to be a publicly traded company. 

In my own personal experience, and Brian, my co-founder, would attest to this, yes, there are certainly some taxes and requirements we have to deal with now as a publicly traded company that we didn’t have to handle as a private one. However, there are also benefits. For instance, if you're venture-backed and private, you're somewhat at the mercy of the market and how VCs perceive your category. When you're out raising a round of capital, you get marked to market based on what someone is willing to fund the company at. 

One of the nicest things, which is often underappreciated, is that we know right now what the market values HubSpot at. I can tell you that any business day of the week. There’s a certain comfort in that. Additionally, I tell folks within the company that the valuation operates in a relatively efficient market. The public stock market is, by economic definition, a relatively efficient market. The valuation will oscillate around the actual value. If you focus on creating value—on what you're actually building—the valuation will sometimes be higher than you deserve and sometimes lower. But over time, those two things will align. This is almost a definition of an efficient market: information moves, and then the valuation catches up with the actual value.

Here's another social reason why I think founders should consider going public. In our first pre-public years, I think we were eight years old when we went public, and we had created roughly a billion dollars in market cap, give or take. We hadn’t been a unicorn, so it was slightly below that when we went public. HubSpot was never a unicorn because that term applies to privately held companies valued over a billion. In the subsequent years, we went from a billion dollars in market cap to 30 billion, which is roughly where we are now. 

That first billion of market cap creation allowed a very small number of people to participate. However, the rest of the 29 billion dollars in market cap allowed everyone—every public investor—to have a chance to participate. I like the idea that while you believe in your company, there are lots of people who believed in HubSpot, and it’s nice to let them participate. Our customers, our partners, our well-wishers can now share in the upside. You don’t get that in the private markets because it’s a closed system; you can’t just buy shares in every private company you like. I wish that existed, but it doesn’t. Going public is a way to let the market at large participate in your growth earlier.
