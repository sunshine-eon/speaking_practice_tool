============================================================

What about from the perspective of just staying excited and motivated and finding things to take on? Is there any lessons there for founders that are, I don't know, at a larger company and just okay, this is gonna help me stay excited about what I'm doing? 

Yeah, I think this is in Bezos exemplifies this I think the best, which is just because you're a public company does not mandate that you do certain things. All that's necessary is the kind of transparency that says, "Here is what the company is doing. Here's what we're about. Here's what we're solving." He had this with his very first annual shareholders letter, which he obviously writes every year. This is what Amazon is about: we're solving for the long term or whatever. And he didn't say this in a snarky way. If you could reread the letter, it's like, but if you read between the lines, it's like, if you don't agree with this approach, you should not buy Amazon shares. It's like it's a completely optional thing; you don't have to buy it. But this is the way we're going to run the business, and he stayed true to that. 

I'll tell you one quick story. This is what's again to anti-dissuade founders that might be reluctant to go public. One of the core values that HubSpot has been part of the culture from the early, early, early days—literally days—is transparency. One of our mechanisms by which we implement transparency is that all information within HubSpot is equally shared with everyone in the company. Period. Everything. So our balance sheet, whether we raised capital, whether we're gonna be able to meet payroll in six weeks—all those things were transparent all the time, with two exceptions. One is if it was illegal for us to share, let's say if we were looking at some acquisition or whatever that we had non-disclosure, or the information was not completely ours to share. An example of that was salaries. 

We feel that salaries are co-owned both by the company and by that individual, and it's not up to us to share someone's salary if they don't want to do that. So we had that transparency, and then as we went public, we had this meeting with our investment bankers and our lawyers. This was in the IPO prep process. They sit down, and it's part of this all-day meeting. One of the questions is like, "Okay, so who are your designated insiders?" Brian nor I had ever taken a company public before; we're like, "We don't know what that is." It's like, "Oh, it's this kind of group of people that will have access to kind of all the financials." 

So we discovered through that mathematical induction process that if it's true for N, it's true for N plus one. There's no actual legal limit to how many insiders a company can have. We ended up, literally the day we went public, designating every single employee to be a designated insider. This allowed us to maintain the transparency thing because there was no rule that said you could only have five, six, or ten. It was hundreds of people, and we did not make it optional. We didn't say, "Oh, because there are downsides to being an insider." There are windows within which you can't trade, but we're like, "Okay, well, we believe in transparency; everyone's going to have access to it." 

And it's not an opt-in kind of thing; you're like, "You're this. This is it. We're all in together." And we still do this to this day. Even at 7,000 people, everybody's inside, so we can still share all the financials with everyone all the time. You have many contrarian opinions, is what I'm getting from this conversation already, and the way you're pushing the envelope on, "Can we have 10? Can we have a thousand?" 

Curious if there's anything else there—just contrarian ways of running a company. I know there are probably many, but what comes to mind? 

So one of the phrases we like to use in our industry overall is this kind of notion of first principles. I know who popularized it, but it's used a lot. I'm not usually a snarky, but I'm not gonna say something snarky. I think most of the time, first principles are used incorrectly. The way first principles are supposed to work, as Elon would probably describe it, is that it's not first principles like the first principles of what we believe. These are core kind of first principles in the company; it's the first principles of the universe. It's not what you believe is true; it's what do we all collectively know to be true to the best of our knowledge. It's science, right? 

That's like physics, like the first and second law of thermodynamics. Those are first principles. All the layers on top of that are things that you think are true, or your assumptions, or the decisions you made. And that's fine; you may have made some decisions. For instance, transparency is not a first principle; it's a founding principle. It's not like everyone should do this; it's like a completely core thing. 

And so yes, I can be contrarian, but you have to kind of limit the dimensions. The number of things that you're contrarian on has to be greater than zero, but not too high, right? So you want what I think of as high conviction, low consensus bets. High conviction is we really, really believe this, and low consensus is that most other people don't. The other people have kind of phrased this differently. I think Peter Thiel actually says it more simply and elegantly, which is you need to be right about something that other people think you're wrong about for a very long time. 

One of the early kind of high conviction decisions we made at HubSpot was that we were gonna focus on SMB as our target market. I'll make a case both for SMB and for having high conviction. It doesn't have to be a target market, but something—once you make that bet, because it's low consensus, it's going to be hard and necessary for you to have the conviction because everyone disagrees, including your board, including your investors, including potential investors. 

So we have that for literally all 18 years of HubSpot's history. We have always had the quick—during the IPO road shows, like, "Yes, we get that you've kind of on SMB, but so what's the path to the enterprise?" No, you don't understand. This is not a go-to-market strategy. This is not like, "Oh, we're gonna conquer SMB first." This is not bowling pin; this is not Jeffrey Moore. This is a "we are here for SMB." That's what we're doing. 

And so we maintain that conviction for a very long time, and that kind of helps you make other bets that are secondary. But you don't want to reinvent everything. I'll give an example of something that we had in the early years of HubSpot that we only kind of forwent. In the early years of HubSpot, we were like, "Okay, we believe in a flat organization." One of the manifestations of that flat organization is we had no titles in the company. Nobody had a title. 

Even though you have business cards, whatever, we had no titles. If you introduce yourself, you know, in a meeting, and we had this up to like hundreds of people, when you introduce yourself, like, "Oh, I work in product. I work in engineering," or whatever. It's not like, "I'm director of X" or "VP of Y" because that as a thing didn't exist. Then as we scaled, we came to the realization that there's actual value that people ascribe to titles. 

The reason they ascribe value to titles is because there were rumors that there was life beyond HubSpot. I couldn't believe it. What? There's a life out there outside of HubSpot? It's like, "Yeah, but look, when we go to the Thanksgiving dinner or whatever, and I talk to my aunt, I need some shorthand." Like, "Oh, yeah, I got promoted to director." I got promoted—like, you know, just show some progression because it's a signaling device. 

In this life beyond HubSpot and outside of HubSpot, other people also didn't want to know sort of where I was. This was the winning argument. I love this argument because we had a day-long meeting on talking about this one topic, and the winning argument was Dermation brought. I recognize why we don't have titles. I recognize this. They made the case of, "Yeah, there's value," and it's like, "By virtue of you not giving us titles, that means you're having to compensate us in economic sense in other ways, right?" 

So you're losing out because it's like, "Is that value high enough to not do that?" That's a strong case. And so we headed down to three choices. We're like, "Okay, well, we could have chosen to just stay firm. It's like still no titles. We could have said, 'Okay, we're gonna have classic titles.'" Then I had the option on the table of "make up your own title." Like, you could be Grand Puba of X, and that can be your title. 

Then we ended up making a decision to go with classic titles because that actually served the need of there's a benchmark. It was a standard; otherwise, it doesn't mean anything. So having made-up titles is pretty much the equivalent of having no titles because they lack any meat. Anyway, but that's one of those things that, okay, you sort of iterate; you change things as they go. 

Yeah, I think there's so much to this. Let's just try things differently. Okay, that didn't work. Let's, okay, we're fine. We're just gonna do whatever else is doing here, and then often you discover a thing that, okay, this is actually better. Just to understand, when people have no titles, so someone says as a product manager, what do you call them? A product manager? You're just like, "I'm an employee at HubSpot. I have literally no title." 

At the time, we had no titles, and now we have classic titles. Yeah, we have levels of things, but back then it's like you're just here. No title. We don't know exactly. I saw somewhere that you paid everyone $5,000 monthly as their salary at the beginning of HubSpot, including yourselves, for a long time. Yes, sorry. Another fun fact. How long did that last, by the way? 

Trying to think back. It's a long time ago. I want to say probably like the first year, a year and a half. Amazing. And one of the things that—and this is one of the core—and not everything that, you know, we obviously—not everything was right, but not everything is kind of applicable to other companies. But there are some things that I think are. 

One of the things that I think are applicable is just this need to solve for simplicity, right? It's like the simpler you can make things in the early years, the better off you generally are. So part of this is—it's gonna sound weird. So how we wound up with transparency is not because of like some moral position like, "Oh, everyone deserved to have this, and this is the truth." So it's not some moral position. 

It was when we hired the first employee in this post of both writer and geeky. When we had the first employee, we had to make the decision. It's like, "Oh, so what files do we give them access to?" And so Brian is like, "Well, like why? Well, there's nothing." I'm like, "Why would we do that?" And so then we kind of—the output of that was like, "Okay, well, binary decisions are much easier than non-binary decisions." 

It's like, "Okay, like everything or nothing is much, much simpler." And then it's like, "Okay, well, if it works for employee number three in the company, why wouldn't it work at four? Why wouldn't it work at five? Why wouldn't it work at 50?" And we just kept doing it because it's like, "Okay, well, until it breaks, we'll just keep doing that," right? 

And so this applies to so many different aspects of HubSpot. We try to start with the simplest possible thing that might work, and then if necessary, add the complexity, add the things, or whatever. Like even our original—this is actually the tactical thing that everyone should take away, especially early-stage startups. The very first HubSpot office had exactly four tables because aspirations for growth, right? 

We were in a co-working space, so we worked back in the day here in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We had four tiers, and the only distinguishing characteristic of the four chairs were two chairs that were by the window and two chairs not by the window. Okay, great. Hire that first employee. Other decision we have to make is like, "Okay, well, where do people sit?" 

It felt unfair to us that we would just get the window seats or whatever. It's like, "Okay, we believe in a flat organization. Why?" And so what we did is we said, "Oh, we'll just do a lottery." It's not like, "Oh, whoever pulls the thing gets the window seat." Whoever pulls gets to choose from the remaining seats because different people ascribe different utility to different seats, right? 

It's like maybe you don't want a window seat; maybe you like the darker corner, whatever it is. So we did that with employee number one, then did that with employee number two, and we did it every time we hired a new employee. We would do a seat shuffle. We're gonna do the lottery; we're gonna go down the sequence, and of all the seats, that was the algorithm, right? 

Our investors are like, "Oh, that's cute, and that's funny. It's not gonna work at 15, 20 people. It's not gonna work at 50." Worked at 25, worked at 50, worked at 100, worked at 200. We updated the algorithm; we did some local optimizations, which we said, "Oh, there are some groups that should not be next to other groups because engineers like quiet time and salespeople don't." 

So we're gonna try to kind of optimize a little bit, so it's not completely random anymore. Now it's like within this product. Well, we still would do it. Then we said, "Okay, we're not gonna do it for every hire; we're gonna do it every quarter." And that stood, by the way, for hundreds of people. That mechanism still worked, right? 

So the moral of the story is that one decision of simplifying—can you imagine the amount of politics we avoided? In corporate America, the amount of calories spent is like, "Well, your office is bigger than my office. Your desk is one inch higher or one—" would it like, "No." All of that just went away by virtue of that one decision, and we don't even know. It's incalculable, honestly, how much grief that saved us. 

Then there are all other kinds of side benefits to it in terms of people getting to know each other better, better chemistry. There was lots of good upside, but just the simplicity is almost always a better answer. I love that everything often comes back to some algorithm you've developed or this N plus one approach of like, "Let's just keep going until something goes wrong." This is amazing. I'm excited for many more of these hilarious, amazing examples of how you do things differently.
