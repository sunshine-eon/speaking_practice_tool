[00:00] And companies form roots and roots like go in the ground and like once your root structure is formed
[00:07] The plant that grows from that is like the plant that grows from that basically you kind of have to uproot and
[00:13] I mean, this is not really a totally clear metaphor because like that plant is that plant
[00:17] But you almost have to plant a new seed somewhere else
[00:20] Let's just say and then grow something new because it's very hard to change in
[00:25] Flight and change what you have and change what you're used to so what we often encourage people to do is like keep working the way
[00:31] You're working, but some future project some low
[00:35] Criticality project try this new method on that so if it doesn't work
[00:39] It's probably not going to work very well the first time just like if I gave you a guitar
[00:42] You never played before it'd be unreasonable for me to expect you to play well
[00:46] You're gonna suck for a while
[00:48] so go pick some things that don't matter if you suck at them for a while and try this method over there and
[00:54] Go, you know, I'm actually getting quite good now. Let's try to bring this into some more critical stuff
[00:58] And I think that's the important way to approach these sorts of projects, which is to
[01:03] To take the criticality out because what ends up happening is is that when people try to try something new on something really critical
[01:08] And it doesn't work. They will never try it again
[01:10] They've just like if they've destroyed all future opportunities to try this again because everyone knows how bad it went last time on something
[01:18] That really mattered and they would have gone
[01:20] We could have done it our old way our old way worked
[01:22] I mean it's kind of sucked but it worked and so now you're comparing, you know
[01:27] Two things that aren't really comparable
[01:28] But you're always gonna go with the momentum that you had versus the new thing and so you got to be careful with that
[01:32] So I know I'm rambling a bit on it
[01:34] But that's that's my general sense and feel on on how to adopt a different way work
