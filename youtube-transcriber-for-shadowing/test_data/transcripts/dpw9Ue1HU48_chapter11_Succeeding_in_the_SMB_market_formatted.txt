I can't help but talk about this SMB piece because I do a lot of angel investing, and classically, companies that focus on small businesses are very challenging. Getting to small businesses at scale is very hard. They're often kind of more old school, not early adopters. You sell one, and that's just like one small customer. They're not going to upgrade and roll it out to this large group, and they're not going to increase spend very quickly. 

For founders that are exploring SMB or trying to win something in the SMB space, any advice? Other than just maybe the advice is probably don't do it. It's very hard. No, my advice is absolutely do it. Amazing. A, because it's hard, and we'll talk about that. But B, okay, so I'll tell you this quick story in terms of how we chose SMB. My co-founder, I met in grad school, and he had done software. He's on the kind of sales and marketing side, while I was on the product engineering side. We didn't know each other before grad school, and we met there. 

As we were noodling on possible ideas of working together on the startup, we said, "Oh, we had done both enterprise software before," right? The kind of opposite of SMB. There are definitely challenges with enterprise software. One of the biggest ones is that life as an enterprise software company sucks as a startup. Sales cycles are super long, feedback loops are super long, and you have revenue concentration, which means you don't completely own your product roadmap anymore because whoever is writing the biggest check will ask for these three things. It's really hard to say no, especially as a startup. 

At the other end of the spectrum, you have consumer startups. The problem with consumer startups is they have very bimodal outcomes. Either you can be super successful—the next Meta, the next Google, the next whatever—or it's going to be zero. It's very rare that you have, "Oh, you made a few million bucks," or whatever. I think either it worked because it's a massive market. 

The case for SMB is you have almost the best of both worlds. You have the nicety of enterprise, which is, "Oh, I can solve a product, and people pay me money for it." I don't have to be advertising-subsidized. I don't have this bimodal outcome. I can build an incrementally more valuable business that's measurable. So, we went from 100K in ARR to a million AR, to two million AR because we're a business software company. 

But it has the benefit of consumer because there are millions of them out there to sell to. There is no revenue concentration. You do control your roadmap. You have very short feedback loops. You can try pretty much anything that you want because, you know, like, "Oh, we have 50 customers. What if we do this and screw it up?" It's like, there's 5 million more. And that doesn't intentionally screw it up, but you can experiment. You can take on risks. 

By the way, when HubSpot started in SMB, it was literally like 100 times harder to succeed at SMB. We could not raise capital; it was so hard. The common argument was that there literally is exactly one company in the history of software that's made a global brand and billions of dollars of market that was into it. No one else had ever created an SMB-focused software company before. And we're like, "Yeah, it's like, we know." 

But the nice thing about it is once you figure the physics of it out, because it's so hard to do, you end up—and this has played out—now there are lots more proof points in Shopify and a bunch of companies that have succeeded in SMB. One of the things about SMB is that in the software market, and this is all I know, is that in software, there's what I call reverse gravity. Over time, the market will always pull you up. 

What ends up happening is that smart founders and smart management teams will look at the numbers and say, "Oh, well, as it turns out, our bigger customers stay with us longer, pay us more, and often have higher NP." If you allow yourself to be led by that, which seems like a reasonable smart thing to do, you will get pulled up in the market. Because of this reverse gravity, almost every successful software company ends up being an enterprise software company over the full list of time. 

The byproduct of that reverse gravity is that every software company ends up being an enterprise software company, so you end up competing with literally everyone. In the SMB world, you're only competing with the people stupid enough to stay focused on SMB or try to do that. It's a much harder thing to accomplish, but once you figure out the physics of it and make it work, it's a much more sustainable, much more fun model. 

So I encourage particularly startups to maybe fight reverse gravity for some period of time. At least start their try to make it work until it gets really, really, really painful, and then try some more. There's just so much value in SMB.
