============================================================

[00:00] Okay, there's a few other random things. I'm going to touch on one is sales
[00:04] So historically shopify has been very product-like growth very organic. Go check it out sign up shop a store start a store
[00:12] Grow and you guys have layered on sales and a sales motion. That's an increasing part of your business
[00:18] What have you learned about your team the growth team working with sales and making them a successful relationship?
[00:24] Yeah, no, it has been great over the last couple years as built out the sales order to be that's it's added a whole new
[00:31] Kind of motion to shop by a shop flies product got better
[00:34] It was it it can act it can serve the biggest companies in the world is like the natural evolution
[00:38] Well, let's we're gonna do that for people to grow up on shop fine to be the biggest companies
[00:42] But we're also gonna take folks another platform bring them over for growth and sales. I think the
[00:49] biggest
[00:51] Learning from the kind of the R&D side at least
[00:54] Has been the scale is very different
[00:58] With with sales and so it's really hard to use as much
[01:02] Kind of quantitative data to make nice and growth to make some of those decisions
[01:06] And so a lot of it has been building
[01:09] Much more qualitative insights working with merchant success sales about with the face the challenges
[01:14] They're facing and onboarding a large customer. So how do we build import tools that work for them?
[01:20] How do we make sure they have the right guidance in the product for a very different set of use cases?
[01:26] So a lot of it has been like very much empathy building
[01:29] With sales about what that merchant journey looks like and quite frankly challenging ourselves
[01:34] To think differently. It's been one thing and then second
[01:38] We kind of built two very distinct fun for a little for a little bit
[01:42] There's like a sales funnel you come in you contact us. That's it. There's no mention of self-service
[01:47] There's no this is just like drive Mqls boom, then there's the self-service thing
[01:51] There's no mention of sales anywhere
[01:53] And so one of the last thing the year last you've been really doing is how to create these hyper journeys
[01:58] Where there is we shouldn't force the merchant to choose. Do you want to talk to sales?
[02:02] You want to do self-service?
[02:03] Should give them the options whatever path that they want to go on and so a lot of that's been building into the self-service journey
[02:11] Over to sales and then from sales into self-service
[02:15] That's broken a lot of metrics in the business. That's broken a lot of
[02:19] Ways people have thought about their jobs. And so there's been a lot of kind of cultural
[02:25] Resetting and just getting smarter from a metric standpoint about how do we measure this thing of hybrid journey?
[02:31] They came in via self-service. They went over to sales. How do we value each of those components?
[02:36] In the process and transparently it's like we're still getting better at but it's really important to to get there
[02:43] There's an example of something that broke that would be illustrative of what you're describing. Yeah
[02:49] Yeah, so I think that breaks is
[02:53] to drive someone to
[02:55] From an ad over to self-service
[02:58] We typically look at only the self-service
[03:01] LTV of
[03:03] That person but what happens if they come in?
[03:06] They sign up via self-service and then they go talk to sales
[03:10] They get changed to a sales
[03:13] Driven merchant which means that that value of that merchant which is usually actually quite large does not get
[03:19] Associated back to that ad campaign. Oh guess what that makes that means you would probably reduce investment on that ad campaign
[03:28] Because you weren't valuing that because our system had two different models for calculating LTV sales driven one and a self-service one
[03:35] Uh-oh, we're gonna make sub-optimal investment decisions now by
[03:41] Kind of moving things around even though it's the right thing to do
[03:43] So a lot of us in rebuilding a lot of instrumentation how we do LTV modeling how we do attribution how we do incrementality testing
[03:51] Across each of those different types of outcomes because it was not kind of an intuitive thing for us
[03:58] You know originally because we have built all of these systems
[04:00] But the much more
[04:02] Yeah, it makes silent view. Yeah, basically attribution gets a lot more complicated
[04:07] Are you going in like a multi-touch attribution direction or is there something even more clever?
[04:13] you know my my frant is I am a
[04:16] My multi-touch attribution as it's as its place. I think ideally
[04:21] What we want to get through is what we really care about is incrementality
[04:25] And so incrementality is kind of the the gold standards if we both are less like, you know attribution measures like
[04:32] How do you assign value to a given touch point right click a view etc
[04:37] But it doesn't tell you causally
[04:39] What drove something right that's where incrementality tells you incrementality test is basically don't show ads on meta for certain
[04:46] some of our people
[04:47] Show it to the other set see what the lift is in the outcome
[04:50] And so a lot of what we're doing is trying to get a lot is continuing yet even more sophisticated in incrementality measurement
[04:59] For not just self-serve outcomes, but for self-service outcomes that then drive to sales
[05:05] For sales specific
[05:08] Outcomes and as soon as we have that kind of incrementality at the channel level
[05:13] We can get a lot more sophisticated in terms of our
[05:17] Our bidding budgeting and all that that's really the key the key thing we want to get to
[05:22] There are certain topics that a loan can be their own podcast
[05:25] Conversation to just dive deep into the stuff when I'm gonna stop myself and I'll go further down that track
