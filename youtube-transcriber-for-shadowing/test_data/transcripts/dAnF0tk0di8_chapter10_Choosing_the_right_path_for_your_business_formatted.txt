============================================================

Just to close this thought around whether, if you have an idea, going the venture route makes sense, what do venture-scale companies need to achieve? What do investors look for for that to even work out? To your point, it almost never works out. What is it you have to do for it to feel like, okay, this is a venture-scale idea versus this is an awesome idea? We could just make money every year, every month from it and not raise money, and life will be great.

I'm probably the wrong person to ask, but I mean, I would say there are versions of art. Let's just take Monday, for example. It's not that Basecamp and Monday are quite a bit different, but they live in the same world. We could have flipped it; someone could have had the Monday approach and sold Basecamp that way, and Basecamp could have gone big in that way while Monday could have stayed small in our way. Again, I'd rather be my business than their business. I would not trade Basecamp for Monday's business any day of the week because I love what we're doing. We're profitable, and we don't have to deal with the things they have to deal with.

I wouldn't trade businesses or places with anybody, but you could imagine it could have been swapped. It's not that Basecamp couldn't be this big venture-scale, whatever you want to call it. Although, look, we have the same number of customers roughly as they do. I guess we are venture-scale in that respect, but again, the point is that depending on how you approach it, you can take anything in any different direction. It's more of a mindset. What are you after? We're not after that, and they are, so that's what they do, and we do it a different way.

I don't necessarily think... I mean, there's things like Airbnb, which is a great example. That has to have a certain degree of scale to really be something that no matter where you go in the world, you're like, I can get an Airbnb there. That's probably going to take money to get there. The same thing with Uber. Uber is another example. These are easy to pick, but they're great examples really. When Uber was getting started, they had to proliferate all over the country to begin with and all over the world. It was this reliable thing you could think of, just like you would think of a cab. If I went to New York or Chicago, I knew there'd be a cab. Was there going to be an Uber? I don't know. Well, you have to know that there's going to be one to begin to trust it. 

In order to do that, you have to expand rapidly. Those businesses exist, and those are great examples of venture-backed companies that need that massive initial push to be available in all the different places because they're actual physical products. Airbnb is a physical product. Uber is a physical product. Basecamp, Monday, Asana, they're available everywhere instantly anyway. I don't know what you need the money for other than marketing. It's interesting because marketing is losing them a lot of money, so it's an interesting thing. Anyway, you can talk to them about that.
