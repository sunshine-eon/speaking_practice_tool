And kind of what is seen as success here. And just to clarify, so that North Star is that phrase that used of just connecting people to economic opportunity, right? That's it, that's it. And it sounds, I know it sounds bigger than it seems, but I can probably, you know, time example again, you can understand when someone's driving on it and I haven't been here for a little bit now, you can understand when someone knows that, when someone's doesn't, it's a hard thing to lose track of.

Yeah, it does sound vague in like a nice fuzzy warm thing that people can say. What you're saying is that it's actually like, it's brought up in meetings constantly in product reviews, like you're saying in this product review, everything changed when you came at it from that one perspective. 

Yeah, I mean, this was my first product here was the profile. You can make a profile that does a lot of different things as you can imagine. You could, you know, you could think about how identity could be used in many different phase and what you should prioritize or not. But if you can explain why this is the thing that you should do that would help someone, you know, really do what they want to do, maybe it's, you know, have an incredible podcast and send that out there. Maybe it's helping them connect to a job, but if you can understand intent and how this unlocked and why you want to prioritize that item, all of a sudden the world gets a lot simpler.

How does that actually get operationalized at a company? Is it just the leaders remind people of that? It's like painted on the walls. How is that a thing that people come back to over and over? I do think it's a lot of repeat, repeat, repeat. I do think that's it. I do think the culture has a pretty high immune system now in the sense that when you aren't operating by that, people can see it and they operate against it. But I also think it's probably the, I think when, you know, Jeff was the, and Ryan and they are just exceptional at continuously repeating that. And it's been so consistent for so long that I think it's just kind of the DNA now. And I do think it's exceptional. I think it's exceptional leadership and I've learned so much from kind of watching it and how it gets operated.

Is there a metric associated with that when people use it in a way of like, no, that's not actually what we mean? Is there some way of making it even more concrete in goals, metrics, ways to understand if people are actually achieving that? Yeah, totally. So I think at the next level of operation, what we think about is, you know, when we run these marketplaces throughout this ecosystem to connect people out to me, what are the outputs that they matter? 

So I'll just give you mine. For example, we think a lot about number of hires, how many people did we match, which is a real tangible way of looking at opportunity. And then number of people who learned a skill, which is usually in this world measured more by time than anything. If you learn, spend time for X amount of minutes, we kind of do that skill because oftentimes skills don't have a direct outcome as you can measure it. And so we basically look at those things more than any other to say how successful that we are operating that marketplace. Got it. That was make total sense to me.
