============================================================

[00:00] And then what's kind of like the vision for a lovable, like what's the end state of this?
[00:06] Is this everybody can build anything they want sort of thing?
[00:09] What's the simplest way to understand where you're going in the next ten years?
[00:12] I mean, I have to say, so we're building the last piece of software
[00:16] and it is inherently very hard to predict how the world looks like in five years these days.
[00:21] It's very hard.
[00:22] But the last piece of software, how I see that is that it's almost instant
[00:28] to go from what you want to change in a product or what product you want to build
[00:32] to having it fully working end to end integrated with any of your existing systems
[00:37] or integrated with the kind of very powerful third party providers.
[00:42] Already today, you can just ask, add a chat with OpenAI
[00:46] and then you get a chat with OpenAI in your product.
[00:49] But that's like just working perfectly is something that's coming in the coming two years out.
[00:57] And then after that, there's a lot of things in building a product
[01:04] that is not just the engineering side, right?
[01:07] And I think an AI can be very useful in aggregating and understanding your users.
[01:16] So if you use the analytics tools, you know that there's something quite common
[01:22] which is to see how users have interacted with the product.
[01:26] AI's can do that on an absolutely massive scale and propose changes to a human to say like,
[01:32] oh yeah, that sounds like a good change to make it a bit more intuitive.
[01:36] And it can also automatically run spin out AB tests
[01:40] so that you can see the data or these improvements to the product.
[01:44] So I think that's on the horizon as well quite soon.
