============================================================

You guys found such a unique way of working. I've never heard of a company working in these ways in so many contrarian ways. I think it's going to be a really interesting case study as things progress. Essentially, what you've done is shut down traditional growth channels or at least limited them—Paggrowth, and maybe SEO, maybe referrals, at least for a while. And you've kind of shifted to, let's just make an awesome product and tell people about it. Our bet is that what's going to grow.

Do you feel like this can work for most other products, or is there a consumer-specific opportunity? What advice would you give to founders that are thinking about, man, we should try something like this? I think that this methodology can work for everyone, but I don't think you have to be as ideological or have to go all the way to 100. I still think growth channels matter. To be clear, we still spend money on performance marketing. We still do measure conversion, and we will do some experiments.

Think of conversion and growth optimization as like running a football down a field and think of these big leaps as passive. You should probably be doing 80% passes, 20% running the ball down the field. A lot of companies, they do 80% running the ball down the field versus 20% passes. So I think that this methodology will work for everyone. I mean, sure of the things I believe, I'll give you a checklist.

Number one, I think that the CEO, unless they're not a product person, should think of themselves as the chief product officer and they should be involved in the product. Number two, if you're not functional, I would at least think about everyone being really close together. So here's no way of saying it, Lenny. Every product manager should be interconnected and know what everyone else is doing. They shouldn't be independently siloed unless they're really running like separate companies or separate orgs and they have no dependencies.

I think that every leader should be an expert in what they're leading. There should be no people managers in the entire company. And when I say people managers, I mean your only responsibility is people, not the work or not the domain, because you can't manage people to avoid of their work. Imagine like a fire chief; they don't know anything about putting out fires. That's crazy. You have to know the subject matter.

People should aim to have as few people as possible on their team. I'm not saying eliminate people. I mean, grow slowly and do not be reckless. Five teams should do one thing rather than one team do five things. So that's just a metaphor. People should work together. I think that people should consider doing launches. You can, by the way, ship every hour of every day, but then package it and tell a story if you want to hold the product back.

I think that teams should use data, but they should also use research and intuition. There's a designer called Charles Ames who said you can't delegate understanding. If you're going to do A/B experiments or measure data, you have to understand what it means. I think that you have to have an intuition. Intuition comes not from arbitrariness; it comes from understanding.

I would make sure that you have engineering and design ideally report to the founder, product-led person. I would not have design under product unless you have an extremely good reason the product person kind of is a designer. I would try to think about product management, expanding the responsibility and including distribution, understanding the customer, and teaching people how to tell a story.

I would try to make sure that the product managers are a combination of art and science. I do not think you want purely technical product managers doing things if they're going to work with non-technical functions. If they're only working with technical functions, that's fine, but they shouldn't work in non-technical functions. I think that's a problem.

I should make sure that marketing and engineering are interconnected. I would make sure that you have as few layers between a CEO and other people. If you're a CEO, every direct to your direct should be an implicit dotted line to you. I treat every direct to my direct as if they're a direct report, a dotted line. I don't try to conflict with the direction of my team, but I always want to know what another layer below me is doing.

I think you should think of each release as a chapter of a story or like an episode of a TV series. You should think of your company in a five or ten-year story. You may not know where you are in ten years, but you're telling this ongoing story. First of all, I would say that everyone should row in the same direction. If there's only one thing I said in this interview today, I'm not sure what it would be, but I think a good candidate is to try to get everyone to row together in the same direction. Otherwise, why the hell are you all in the same company?
