============================================================

That is beautiful. It reminds me, you mentioned Sam Altman. There's a tweet that he put out a couple weeks ago that I'll read real quick. Many people have reached out to offer help and advice over the past year. No one has gotten close to Brian Chesky in terms of delivering. He will take a midnight call at any time, put in an hour's work on any topic, answer difficult questions correctly with clarity, make any intro, etc. How's that feel to have seen that?

I was, I had no idea he was going to do that. And I just want to say, like, I think Sam is obviously like a once in a generation founder. I think what he's done with OpenAI is extraordinary. When he launched ChatGPT, I had known him for a real long period of time, and I kind of knew a sense of the journey he was about to go on. I think that he was very deep into the technical part and the research-oriented part of OpenAI. But it turned out there was a product, a design, a marketing, a leadership, a sales—there were all these other functional responsibilities.

Being able to just play a small part in giving some advice when necessary was important. He would take what he wanted and discard others. But I think, Lenny, maybe this goes to another thing, which is all I tried to do with Sam was what other people did for me. When I started, before my commentator, there was a person named Michael Sybel, he's in Y Combinator. He used to meet with me and give me advice. He wasn't an official advisor, he wasn't an investor, I didn't hire him or anything like that. He wasn't on my board. I asked him, I said, how do I pay you? 

He said, well, I want you to pass it on to other founders. I would meet with a lot of people in the Valley, and there was this incredible culture of generosity that we all were going to win. You know, if the ecosystem was healthy, and the ecosystem would be healthy if we all helped one another and kind of paid it forward. So, you know, I think that it's just one continuation of the Valley of people helping one another, learning from one another. I also feel like I learned by teaching as well.
