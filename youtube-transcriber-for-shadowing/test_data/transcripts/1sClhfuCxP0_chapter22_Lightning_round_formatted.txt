Chapter 22: Lightning round
Video: The full-stack PM | Anuj Rathi (Swiggy, Jupiter Money, Flipkart)
Time: 67:48 - 72:29
============================================================

No problem. I want to go take it out, get user feedback, trade, and so on. So understanding the market is important, but it also comes back to your ongoing advice of being full-stack in a lot of ways. In this case, being a full-stack PM means thinking about marketing, launch, and adoption, among other things.

Next question: What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like? The very recent product that I like is called Rise. It's a sleep hacking app, and because I am kind of a half insomniac, I was thinking about how I can track my sleep to understand what I'm doing and how I can actually get better at it. I really like the way that they help the end user. It's been just a week since I've started using it.

Has it helped your sleep yet, or is it too soon to say? I said it's helped me track my sleep, and now it's getting into the zone where it is actionable. But I like it. We'll see.

Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and like to share with people to think about in either work or life? I have a few mottos, but one of the things I keep telling my people who work with me is to stop externalizing. The more artistic way to say that is, "You are the reason for your own misery." I use that a lot in a fun way. If things go wrong—if that leadership meeting didn't happen the way I wanted, or if my product bombed—let's ask ourselves what we could have done better. 

Of course, because I'm also a poker player, I understand there is half luck involved and half skill. But over a long period of time, if it's only luck and you're failing repeatedly, you have to look back at your skill. So yes, you are the reason for your misery. I love that advice; it’s very empowering and encourages personal responsibility.

Final question: I was looking at your LinkedIn, and I saw that you host an event called the Secret Soirée, which isn’t that secret since you post about it. I'm curious what that’s all about and what got you to do these sorts of events. 

We just started it, me and an ex-colleague of mine, Shawangi. We essentially wanted to meet cool people around us. That's how it started—bringing together interesting people without an agenda to discuss entrepreneurship, startups, products, connections, and so forth. It just began like that, and now we are working on many more interesting things, including team-based cohorts around product management, marketing, growth, and so on. We are strictly keeping it non-profit for at least the next year, but we have a long way to go.

For listeners, is this something they could join? Who should look to do this? Absolutely! At that time, we probably will not call it the Secret Soirée once it has expanded and is no longer a secret. 

Okay, cool. They can just follow you on LinkedIn, right? That’s how they can keep up to date with these sorts of events? 

Yes, on LinkedIn as well as on Twitter.

Awesome. Anuj, we've gone through so many topics. We've talked about breaking bad, full-stack product management, full-stack thinking, working backwards, the butter rule of threes, and so many other things. 

Two final questions: Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and follow up on anything we've talked about? And how can listeners be useful to you? 

Yes, I'm on Twitter at twitter.com/AnujRatty, and on LinkedIn, you can just search my name. I'm pretty active on both platforms. I do a bunch of events and talks, so I keep posting on Twitter.

Amazing. Anuj, thank you so much for being here. 

Thank you so much, Lenny, for hosting. It's my pleasure. Bye everyone!
