Chapter 19: Tips for preventing burnout
Video: Brian Chesky’s new playbook
Time: 50:05 - 56:02
============================================================

[00:00] I've definitely been through that where you set a crazy goal and then we ended up hitting it.
[00:04] And so I've seen that myself.
[00:06] With some of the things you've talked about, say, do it now, we're not going to wait another week to circle back.
[00:12] And this stuff you talked about of taking on the CPO role, not having a CPO.
[00:16] And also all these launches. It sounds like a lot of work and a lot of hours.
[00:21] What have you learned about avoiding burnout and creating balance and also just helping people on your team avoid burnout and creating balance?
[00:28] So first of all, I want to give you a very surprising learning.
[00:34] I weirdly now, the more I get involved, this is so weird.
[00:40] The more the details I am, the more time I have on my hands.
[00:43] That's a paradox.
[00:44] And I want to explain that paradox. It doesn't make any sense.
[00:47] But when I explain this process to people that I would be in the details, we'd have one shared consciousness, I would review everything.
[00:53] We would do endless edits of even the press release.
[00:56] It would seem like I would be working 80 hundred hours a week and that people would be disempowered and that no one would want to do anything.
[01:03] And I got just the opposite.
[01:05] Here's what I found.
[01:07] If you decide to be in the details and get very, very hands on like I did, it might be a lot more work for about one to two years.
[01:15] And so for one to two years, it was way more work than the old way.
[01:19] But once we turn the corner, suddenly everyone started rowing the same direction.
[01:25] Suddenly I didn't have to be in meetings anymore and people would do what I wanted to do if I wasn't there.
[01:30] And by the way, that's what the culture is.
[01:32] They say the culture is what happens when you're not in the room and the brand is what people say when you're not in the room.
[01:37] And so that became our culture that suddenly there was fewer conflicts in the company.
[01:44] There was less turnover.
[01:46] People were rolling in the same direction that I wasn't reacting before I would get 10 surprises.
[01:53] Nine were bad.
[01:55] Now I get 10 surprises.
[01:56] Nine are good.
[01:57] And you don't really have to do anything about good surprises, only bad surprises that I used to have to intervene in projects I wasn't involved in because they were going off into the wrong direction.
[02:07] And by the time I got involved, I was associated with dysfunction, but I only got involved because it was dysfunctional.
[02:12] It wasn't actually going well.
[02:14] And then it was three times as work to fix something because we weren't involved in the very early stages.
[02:19] So I was much more involved.
[02:23] I had a lot less time in my hands initially.
[02:25] And now I actually weirdly have a lot more time on my hands.
[02:28] But the answer question on burnout, I think is another very good question.
[02:31] I do not think I'm the poster child, at least historically, of work life balance.
[02:36] I'm 42 years old.
[02:38] I live with a golden retriever.
[02:39] I don't yet have a family.
[02:41] And if you asked me when I was in college how I thought my life would be right now, I probably would have thought the inverse that I have a family.
[02:49] And I'd one day run a company.
[02:51] And I did things in a slightly different order.
[02:54] But one of the things I've learned is that there's this temptation to work more and more and more hours.
[03:00] And sometimes you just let an artist have to step away from the painting and you actually start getting more derivative slower and slower.
[03:08] And so I basically have tried to break into practice to step away from the work.
[03:13] And so here's some of the things I do.
[03:15] Every other weekend, I like don't really work at all.
[03:18] And then every other weekend, I work pretty intensely.
[03:22] If I had a family, it would probably be more like a day of the weekend.
[03:25] I'd work more intensely.
[03:26] So you wouldn't be a parent every weekend, but I'm not.
[03:29] So it's a little different.
[03:30] I usually make sure I exercise and I never miss a workout.
[03:33] So I usually wake up.
[03:35] I'll do like 20 minutes of morning cardio and a Peloton.
[03:38] I'll go to the gym three or four times a week and do weights.
[03:40] So I'll basically do cardio just about every day.
[03:43] I make sure that I eat really healthy.
[03:45] I have like a kind of classic bodybuilding diet of five to six meals a day.
[03:50] So I think I try to make sure I do that.
[03:52] I try to make sure I get a fairly good amount of sleep.
[03:55] And then the other two things I try to do is have really healthy relationships.
[03:59] I think one of the most important things that we'll govern, like how happy you are in your life, is your relationships.
[04:06] I think the two govern, I think the three things, your health, your relationships, and your work.
[04:09] Those are probably the three most important things.
[04:11] So as long as you're healthy and you have meaningful work, the last is relationships.
[04:15] And there was this Harvard study.
[04:17] It's the longest study on human happiness.
[04:18] I think it's 85 years old.
[04:20] And the question was, what's the secret of happiness?
[04:23] And of course, they weren't expecting to have a single answer, but they got one.
[04:27] And the answer was the secret to happiness, if there is one, is healthy relationships.
[04:31] And I had found Lenny that over the time of being an entrepreneur, I had gotten totally isolated.
[04:37] That it was almost as if I didn't have friends.
[04:39] I had friends, but I didn't keep in touch with them.
[04:41] And every time I reached out to a friend, I had to get them up to speed on my life.
[04:44] And if you have to get people up to speed, you're not really keeping as much in touch with them.
[04:48] And so I started making a practice a couple of years ago to make sure that I have a group of friends that I'm constantly in touch with,
[04:57] including old friends.
[04:58] So I have a group of high school friends.
[05:00] We have a group chat.
[05:01] We take one to two trips together, we're together a year.
[05:04] I have a group of college friends.
[05:05] We have a group chat.
[05:06] We take probably a couple trips together a year.
[05:08] By the way, doing Airbnb's are great.
[05:10] We all get in the house together.
[05:12] And it's like you, your opportunity to have a shared experience.
[05:16] And if you don't travel your old friends, you have only old stories to talk about.
[05:19] And then you kind of say the same old stories over and over.
[05:22] So you want to be able to have new shared experiences.
[05:24] When I stay here in New York City, I'm in New York right now.
[05:27] That's why you don't see my typical background.
[05:29] I stay in my sister's apartment.
[05:32] So she's got a two bedroom and I stay in her house because I like to see her.
[05:36] And I just make sure I spend a lot of time with friends.
[05:38] And of course we travel.
[05:39] I mean, traveling is what I kind of do with a lot of my friends.
[05:42] And then I like to draw and read.
[05:44] So I try to make sure it's health, work, and relationships.
[05:49] And I try to make sure I have a balance of each.
[05:50] And you might call family relationships.
[05:53] You know, I'm just, I'm single, but you know, that would be another version.
