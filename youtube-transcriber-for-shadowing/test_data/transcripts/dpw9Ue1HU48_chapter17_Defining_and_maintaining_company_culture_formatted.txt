============================================================

Okay. Let's talk about culture. I know you spent a lot of your time on helping build HubSpot's culture and creating the original culture. You created this epic culture code deck, which I think is 128 pages. So maybe just to dive into it, what was that process like to define the culture of a company and maintain it over time?

I'll say it was awful. So I'll give you a very quick story. My co-founder and I were having a lot of our founders' meetings and dinners, as we do. He had been meeting with his CEO group and mentioned, "Oh, Dermash, I hear this culture thing is really important." By the way, the word "culture" had never been mentioned prior to this conversation in the halls of HubSpot, like ever. And this was how many years in? I would say three or four years in. I can check the records. 

Even back when people were kind of in offices, most of our communication was over email and asynchronous. We've always been big believers in that kind of written form. But anyway, so I can tell you whether the word "culture" was used or not, and it was not. He said, "Oh, I've heard that you need to talk to the CEO; culture is super important. Dermash, can you go do that?" I'm like, "Okay, Brian, like all the people and all the companies, I am literally like the bottom decile, if not the worst possible person for this." I don't like people. I just don't like being around them a whole lot. And from what little I know of culture, it sort of involves people, right? I don't know, but it seems like I'd be the wrong person. 

But anyway, I'm a team player. I'm like, "Okay, it does feel like it would be important." So I took on the task. I didn't really know what he meant when he said, "Dermash, can you go do that?" So I took it to mean that culture actually already exists. We have a culture; it's whatever it is. The company is doing well, and people seem happy. So I said, "Okay, well, what I really try to do is kind of describe the culture that's there." So it's not creating culture; it's articulating the culture so we know what it is.

The question I asked myself was, if I could write a Python function that would measure the probability of success of a new person coming into HubSpot, what would the factors be? What are the things that, if I could measure, would tell me how successful and how good they're going to be for HubSpot? That's my exercise. 

So I did an internal survey, and I'll tell you why this was such an awful experience in the beginning. Once I took on this task, I sent an email to the company saying, "Hey, everyone, I'm just going to be digging into culture. So I'm going to send this survey out. I just want to get an understanding so I can write." The negativity and visceral response to that one email was literally up until that point. It still ranks in the top three worst things I've ever experienced. People felt so negatively and so strongly, and I was not expecting it. 

The one line that was gut-wrenching was, "Dermash, here we're talking about culture. Next, we're going to have posters up on the wall about excellence. HubSpot is not the company that I thought I joined." A big part of me was like, "I just did not know how overloaded that idea of culture was." When you dig into it, it's like, "Oh, because so many companies had done it so poorly and just didn't walk the walk." This is why there was this kind of negative response.

So I went back to my thing and said, "I get it. I'm going to try to describe what we have and then write this truth function." I wrote the slide deck, which had exactly 16 slides. That answered the question: if I could write Python code, what are the factors? 

When I did the survey, I sent out the NPS survey, which everyone knows you would send to customers: "On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend HubSpot as a place to work?" The other NPS question is, "Why did you give that answer?" As it turns out, here's the thing I learned, which was troubling. Everyone was happy, and the reason they were happy was because of the other people at HubSpot. That was the number one reason. 

Which is both good and bad. It's like, "Okay, well, that's awesome, but that doesn't tell me anything," right? It's like a self-reinforcing kind of recursive loop. So I thought, "What makes the people at HubSpot the people that are HubSpot?" Let's come up with the attributes that define what it means to be one of these people that makes other people happy. 

We came up with the original set of things that were embodied in that slide deck. I called that slide deck the culture code deck. The reason I called it the culture code deck is not because it was a code of conduct or a moral code or this is how a company should be run. It was because if I could write code to define the culture of HubSpot, this is what the code would look like. 

Since that point, the question I keep asking myself is, if we could have an operating system that ran the company—it's the geeky part of me—not that you could do that, but what would that look like? The big kind of unlock is that there are very few original ideas I've had that are any good. One of them is this: culture is a product, period, and that every company builds two products. One is the product they build for their customers, and the other is a product they build for their team. That's what culture is—the product you build for your team.

If we stipulate that that just happens to be true, then a bunch of things kind of follow from that hypothesis. Just like we would never build a product without talking to customers, we would never build a culture without talking to the customers of the product, which are the people. So we do a repeat of that original NPS survey. We've been doing it every quarter now forever to figure out what the NPS of that product is—our culture product.

There's no product person in the history of humankind that would have said, "Oh, I built this product; it's awesome. I'm done." No one would ever say that. This is the number one mistake I think I'm biased about. I think founders make this mistake: they say, "Oh, we have an awesome culture, and my job is to preserve the culture." That is not the job because the needs of your customers change. The needs of the employees change. 

The culture exists to help great people do great things for the company. That's why the culture is there, and the things they need later as a company scales are different. Just like you would never freeze the lines of code of a product, you would never freeze the lines of code of a culture. Culture should be iterated on just like you iterate on product.

In a product, you will get feedback from customers like, "Oh, here are the bugs." We actually call them bugs. It's like, "Oh, here are the bugs in the culture." We have all-hands meetings, and when the survey comes back, once again, we come back to the transparency notion. Every single survey response is anonymous in terms of who submitted it, and we publish it—the quant score, the subjective thing, everything. 

We categorize it, and then we have the next all-hands meeting, which we call "all minds." It's like, "Okay, so here are the things that we heard." Just like we would do for a product meeting, it's like, "Oh, we just heard back from the customers: here are the bugs that you've identified. Here are the ones we're going to fix and when we're going to fix them." 

The one lesson here is that very few things I've learned are universally applicable. That one, I think, is right. If you think of the people as customers and the culture as a product, it takes away the abstract nature of working on culture. It also takes away this notion that I heard back in the early commentary: "Oh, well, culture is not something you really build because that seems fake." 

No, we craft in the same way. I'm not saying we're going to impose it or do this off in isolation, but we're going to work on it. It's something you actually do manifest, and it's not just up to the founders.

Wow, what an amazing story. You're definitely getting laughs per minute from me. I think there's at least one laugh per minute so far in this podcast. That's amazing. I think this point you just made about your job not being to preserve the culture as a leader is really profound because most people don't think that. They think their job is to maintain the culture as they grow, that it's all fading away. 

But your point is that's good and that's great. Bringing it back to product, I think this is an important thing. This is the second-order lesson alert after you start with culture as product. One of the challenges almost everyone will deal with is that you have these things. Just because culture as product does not mean there's not a sense of having what some might label as core values. 

We have this in product as well. There are core values that the product believes in. We believe in about our product that we're going to hold constant through it. We're building for SMB; we want it to be easy to use. There are constraints that we put on ourselves that are intentional. Even though we iterate, we're not going to iterate away from these things that we just let kind of that high conviction back thing again.

But not everything that's part of your product is a core value. Not everything that was part of your culture in the earlier days is a core value. Transparency is one that has endured over a long time as part of our core value, and we preserved it even though it was troublesome through the IPO. 

There are things that we changed that were part of the belief in a meritocracy in a flat organization. The manifestation of that was a bud with the lack of titles, and so we changed that. There are things, and here's the other thing that is a mixed metaphor problem. There will be things that you have that are kind of core. 

The way I describe it right now—I'm just going to put it out there, I'm taking myself for not coming up with a better metaphor—is like federal versus state law. There are federal laws in the United States that say, "Here are the things, and these are the inalienable rights of all citizens." These are the core values. But then we have state things, right? For this particular state on these particular aspects, they can optimize for their particular state. 

We have something similar at HubSpot. We have a core set of things that are part of the culture. Here's what we believe. Then there are things that individual groups can adapt. Our head of engineering can say, "Yeah, I know our overall founder's leaning is X, but for my particular group, that doesn't really make sense. We're going to do this." 

One of the core things from the early years of HubSpot is that we don't care about what hours you work—from what time to what time. It doesn't matter. Literally, it doesn't matter. We didn't track it; we don't care. But then over time, we realized we have a support organization, and that organization, as it turns out, does matter to our customers. We need to have coverage and things like that. 

So we have to pick our battles, but then kind of fight back. For instance, transparency. There have been times where individual org leaders have said, "Okay, Darmesh, I know you believe in this transparency thing, and Brian believes in this transparency thing. But it's inefficient for someone that is an SDR in the sales organization to have access to the high-order financials. It's a waste of time; it's a distraction." 

That was the argument. You may be right, but the binary decision is that we value transparency so much that, yes, maybe it is a distraction. Fine. The other one is, "I don't want my team to have it because I just don't want to. We were hiring so fast, and once again, that's a lot of trust to put into people." 

But then this is one of the other lessons: cultures over time become self-fulfilling prophecies. The big lesson learned is when I put the first version of the public-facing culture code out there and got feedback from the team, they said, "You say this in the culture code deck, and it's just not true." It was not true enough for us to state that as a thing. 

In the deck, I have what I call these little liner notes—stuff going on right. It's like, "Oh, this is not really true yet." So it's more of an aspiration. This is how we want it to be, but we're not walking the walk yet on this thing. I didn't take it out because I wanted it to be an aspiration. 

What happened over time is that those things that were aspirations became increasingly true by virtue of being in the deck. As people join, it's like, "Oh, that's the thing we aspire to, so I'm going to pretend like that's actually the culture of HubSpot," which is exactly what we want. It's okay to say things that are aspirational; just call them out. Don't present things that are not true, but back off of the things that you would like to be true.

Wow, there are so many lessons there. It reminds me of Airbnb. I was there when they created the original six core values of Airbnb. One of them was "Simplify," and then, I don't know, some number of years later, the founders realized, "We're not actually good at this." Values should reflect who you are, not who you aspire to be. 

I like this middle ground you found: "I'm going to put this in here, but I'll note this isn't necessarily who we are." We didn't do that; that would have been a smart move. They removed that core value. They said, "We're not actually this," and it went from six to four. There was another one they removed. I was really impressed because you're like, "Okay, wait, because it comes up in meetings, and they're like, 'Simplify.' No, it's actually really complicated."
