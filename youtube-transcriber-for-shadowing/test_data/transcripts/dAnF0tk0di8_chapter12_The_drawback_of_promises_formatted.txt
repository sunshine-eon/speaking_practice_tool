You have these quotes along these lines about planning: long-term business planning is a fantasy. I don't plan long-term because I want to do what I think, not what I thought. Yes, I love these. This whole idea of appetites is very appealing. It makes so much sense. It's like the ultimate impact-to-effort calculation. The effort we will put into this is fixed, and we will not go beyond this because the impact we expect from this is pretty clear. If the effort goes up and up and up, why did we even do this? 

But obviously, the downside is you can't promise things really to sales and marketing, which I think makes sense in your type of business. Do you see this work in businesses that aren't your business, this approach? 

Let me talk about promises for a second. Promises are the downfall of every business. Every time we've made a promise to get something out in a certain period of time, we inevitably seem to miss it. It's almost like it would have been out in time, but the fact that we had promised it made it not deliver in time. There's some strange thing that happens when you promise things. 

We've learned to not promise anything. We can share what we're working on if we want to. We can tell people we're doing something. By the way, the worst promise—and by the way, we've made a couple of these recently—we always regret them. It's like "by the end of the year." That's the one promise you've got to be very careful of because it's so easy to make. There's nothing easier than promising work later. The further away it is, the easier it is to promise. This whole "by the end of the year" is a red flag. 

Whenever you say that to yourself, go, "Oh, wait a second. Wait, wait, wait. What am I doing right now?" Because you're probably setting yourself up for disappointment. As far as other companies running this way, there are a number of other companies that are running this way, and more and more are adopting Shape Up all the time. But it's a struggle. It's hard. It's hard to change the way you work.
