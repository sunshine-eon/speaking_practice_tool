============================================================

[00:00] You mentioned this interesting fact about how in India, so the fact that most startups fail,
[00:05] you said, you know, I think the classic status 90% and that the risk is a lot higher to start a
[00:11] company and then fail. Could you just talk about what impact that has? How do people try to
[00:17] avoid that? Because that'd be amazing if you can reduce the risk of starting a company or is
[00:21] it just it happens and people get super in debt. I think long term societies are naturally
[00:28] more risk averse. And not all great CEOs can become great founders for the same reason.
[00:37] In fact, I would say that it actually makes it very hard to be a founder if you've been a great
[00:41] CEO because you've turned into this sustainer versus destroyer or creator. The nuance I'm
[00:51] talking about is when you are thinking about like risk appetite, India is changing because now
[00:57] for the first time we're seeing founders being respected and talked about and these unicorns
[01:02] being celebrated and our Prime Minister talks about startups quite openly. We have a
[01:07] national startup day and so on and so forth. So I think there is a thing that has changed
[01:12] this thing. But the core principle, let's understand the core human behavior basics.
[01:16] India still has large arranged marriage. And if you are a founder and a failed founder,
[01:23] your chance of getting a person to marry is still a hard thing to achieve.
[01:30] So if this is all true, then the appetite to take risk will be controlled.
[01:38] Somebody gave an interesting example to me that there's a very large, let's say,
[01:43] FM CPG company in India. And let's say you do a zero to one over there and see your changes
[01:48] in four, five years and you're zero to one failed, but you are the best person. That's why
[01:53] you've given the zero to one. Next year, like, so what have you done in the last five years?
[01:57] You say, nothing, I just tried to launch as it failed. And you neither given a promotion in
[02:01] the company, neither a new company will say, oh my God, I'm going to hire this talent. So
[02:06] the guy who stayed on this stable brand within the CPG company kept growing because
[02:10] that has natural tail events. All he has to do is nothing in that brand. And then
[02:15] suddenly what you see is that he or she's like managed to do well. And this guy has done a zero
[02:19] to one has not done well. So we do not celebrate risk takers as a country yet. And I think we'll
[02:27] change that. I think it's changing already. But we have a long way to go. One of the
[02:33] beautiful things I often talk about is that I was in Portugal once and I saw, I don't know
[02:39] if you've ever been and seen this, but in the church, normally, let's say only the royalty is allowed
[02:45] to be buried or cremated or whatever, like they are there. Only one more category that allowed
[02:50] is the explorers, Vasco the Gamma, all of these guys who explored the world and took risk and
[02:56] took the country forward. They were given the same position as the royalty. So when we
[03:01] give the highest status to the stakers, the country appreciates it because ultimately
[03:06] we're all looking for markers of social value.
