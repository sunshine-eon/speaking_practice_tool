To detail your ability to articulate your approach to product, you mentioned that writing is really important to you as a way of figuring out what you think and to solve and crystallize problems. This resonates with me, as that's exactly how this whole newsletter started. I was just trying to crystallize what I remembered and did so that I could remember it and share it with people. 

I’d love to hear your insights and take on what writing does for you and maybe what you'd recommend listeners do with this kind of approach of writing to help them think. Throughout the years at Ramp, I was often faced with a problem or question that I couldn't answer off the bat. I had to go back to first principles. The best way of doing that is to shut down your laptop, take out a piece of paper, write the question as simply as possible at the top of the paper, and just spend time thinking about how to answer that question.

It was also a way for me to effectively communicate, especially during COVID, where we largely grew up during a time when everything was written. 

Writing was a way for me to get content out there to increase my brand and Ramp's brand, which ultimately led us to hire better people over time. All these things kind of worked out, but it does require you to block out time and focus on how you think about problems rather than just trying to Google the answer. After you've thought through it, then go out and read, and you'll fine-tune your thinking and identify new questions to ask yourself afterward. 

I love this advice. You mentioned earlier that PMs can't really do much on their own, but I think this is the thing PMs can do: they have the time to think and to...
