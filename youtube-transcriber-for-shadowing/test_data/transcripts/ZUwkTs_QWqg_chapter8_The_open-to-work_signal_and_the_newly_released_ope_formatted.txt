Where people want to go look for jobs and make hires, I was thinking about the open to work feature that LinkedIn has. I remember the days before that existed when people used to just like, Jerry-rig their status by saying, "Hey, I'm hiring" or "I'm looking for a job." There was always this sense that if you were open to work, you weren't as good. The question arose: why would you be amazing and open to work yet not hired? I'm curious if you were even part of this experience. What was it like to come up with that approach to communicate that you're open to work?

It's been through phases, and I think those phases really reflect the changing perceptions around this concept. In the beginning, you could say you were open to work, but it was more of a secret signal to recruiters, if you will. That certainly still exists, but now we've made it possible to more publicly declare it, maybe even through a feed post. We actually started launching this around COVID when the stigmas of unemployment changed dramatically. Everyone began to understand that people were in different situations, and we started framing it in a way that I think is now more iconic.

Interestingly, just this week, we tried something new that feels like a similar journey. Many customers, as you can imagine, have LinkedIn Learning, which is typically an enterprise product that works across the employee base. We're now trying to introduce an "open to internal work" feature, where employees can express their interest in moving internally within their role, allowing internal recruiters to see them. As you can imagine, there might be even more stigma about this, especially concerning how it might affect their relationship with their manager. Different cultures and companies have varying attitudes towards this.

I have a feeling that, as we like to think five to ten years out, this concept will go on a similar journey. That's my hunch—that it will evolve into an employment-driven way for people to find their next role internally. It'll be interesting to see how it plays out, but you can already feel a bit of that tension since we launched it. I hope that we can navigate this well and see how it goes.
