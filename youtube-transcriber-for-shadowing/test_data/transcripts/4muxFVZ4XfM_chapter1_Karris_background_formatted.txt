Chapter 1: Karri’s background
Video: Inside Linear: Building with taste, craft, and focus | Karri Saarinen (co-founder, designer, CEO)
Time: 00:00 - 04:25
============================================================

My belief is that like any domain or industry, the more it matters, the more the design matters. What happens is that whenever there's a new paradigm, like mobile or the web, the first iterations of those products don’t have to be super well designed necessarily because they are the first. But then, as you build the hundred, thousand different email clients, any email client now has to be pretty good to even be considered a reasonable option. The bar is so high. Today, it’s almost like a very basic thing; from the very beginning, you need pretty high-level design for people to even pay attention or consider yours seriously.

Today, my guest is Kari Saranen. Kari was the founding designer and principal designer at Coinbase, co-founder of two previous startups, and most recently, he is the co-founder and CEO of Linear, which I am fairly confident is the fastest growing and most beloved issue tracking tool in the world. It’s something that a growing number of product teams are using to build their own products. Kari and his team are building their company and product in a really unique way, with a huge focus on craft and quality. There are no A/B tests, no metrics-based goals; instead, they focus on taste and opinions. They also don’t have durable cross-functional teams; instead, teams assemble around a project and then disperse once it’s done. Additionally, they have just one product manager as the head of product, and that’s it.

In our conversation, Kari shares how he built a culture around quality and craft, how he makes trade-offs, and how he operationalizes quality and thoughtfulness, where design can be a differentiator in competing against incumbents. We talk about something called the Linear method of building products, which emphasizes building opinionated software and working in consistent cycles, among other principles. We also get into Linear’s unique hiring approach, which involves a paid work trial where candidates work alongside a team for a number of days instead of just having an interview. 

We also get a glimpse into how Linear got their first 10 customers, found product-market fit, and scaled their growth engine. There is so much golden information in this episode, and I am very excited for you to hear it. With that, I bring you Kari Saranen after a short word from our sponsors.

I’ve tried a lot of business banks, and there is nothing even close to the experience you get with Mercury. I moved cash over from another bank, and it literally took less than half an hour to set up the account and wire money over at no cost. They kind of make you want to use the site more often, which I’ve never felt with another banking site.
