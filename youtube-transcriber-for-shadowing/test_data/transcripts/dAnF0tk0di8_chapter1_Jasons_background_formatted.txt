The reason I think it's great for entrepreneurs to start bootstrapping is because they just have more practice making money. They get better and better at the fundamental skill you need to have ultimately to run a successful business, which is to make money. Hopefully, I don't come off as encouraging everyone to be like me. I'm not saying that at all. What I am saying is this is a way to be. It's an alternative to what you're often hearing in our industry, which is like go big or go home, raise a bunch of money and get huge and unicorn status and the whole thing. 

Just know, though, that basically almost nobody makes it that way. Like really almost nobody really makes it that way. There's a lot more room to make it and to build a successful business if you throw out that outlier and look at all the other places you can land as a business. 

Today, my guest is Jason Freed. Jason is the co-founder and CEO of 37 Signals, which makes Base Camp and Hay and soon a few more products, including a competitor to Slack. 37 Signals is a very different type of company. They have no investors, no board. They have no plans to go public. They never want to sell their business. They've made a profit for 24 years in a row. They have over 100,000 customers and make tens of millions of dollars in profit each year, which most VC-backed companies never make a dollar of. 

All of this profit filters down to the founders and employees because they have no investors. Most founders, by default, will go down the venture route raising money from VCs and angels. For many types of companies, that is necessary. But it's also important to know that there is a different option available, and it can be much more fulfilling and fun and even much more lucrative by bootstrapping your idea. 

In my conversation with Jason, we get into why constraints like small teams and less cash often lead to better outcomes, why gut and instinct is underappreciated as a decision-making tool, why planning long-term is often a mistake, why work doesn't have to feel like war, and why we should focus on playing infinite games. We discuss when it makes sense to consider raising venture capital versus bootstrapping and how to actually bootstrap your startup. 

So much more. Jason is fascinating, and he's got a lot of wisdom to share. I'm excited to be able to bring you this conversation. With that, I bring you Jason Freed after a short word from our sponsors.

I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. 

More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates, and within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing a roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda. If your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. 

Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of this special limited-time offer just for startups.
