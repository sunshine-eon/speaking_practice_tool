============================================================

[00:00] Okay, so I took us on a long tangent away from lessons and
[00:04] experiments you ran along the journey of iterating on the
[00:07] streak. So a few things you've shared so far is just like it
[00:09] started being like started with this XP idea and then went to
[00:12] like a lesson, then you iterate it on ways to make it
[00:16] simpler, maybe harder, edit street goals, where you commit
[00:18] to like, I'm going to hit a certain goal of streak. What
[00:22] else? What else have you found that has worked didn't work
[00:24] lessons learns?
[00:25] You know, again, sticking with this one to seven days
[00:28] streak, you know, it is the idea of a streak, particularly
[00:31] probably to this audience is like, obvious, like, oh, it's a
[00:35] streak, it, you know, goes it just counts so many days. We've
[00:38] realized over time that a lot of users do not understand how a
[00:41] streak works. And and it can be as big, you know, as small as
[00:45] why I don't understand how streak freezes work, or I
[00:48] don't like my mom the other day was talking to you about
[00:50] she's like, Oh, my, I like didn't use Duolingo. And I
[00:52] come back, my, you know, streak still there. So like
[00:54] there's like certain elements of the feature that, you know,
[00:57] we can do better at explaining. But even like, what a streak is,
[01:03] it's, it's tracking how many days that I've used the app. Yeah,
[01:06] the more that we can make the feature easily comprehensible to
[01:10] users, the more retentive it is. And it and and we've run a
[01:13] number of experiments to this, you know, as simple, you talked
[01:16] about, you asked about early easy copy changes that we
[01:18] made. So this is my first win, experiment when when I joined
[01:22] Duolingo was, when you start a streak, we use we have
[01:27] little copy at the bottom of the screen that just, I don't
[01:29] know, it's kind of like flavor copy, we use it to celebrate you
[01:33] or give you context. And I ran some tests that just like tried
[01:37] to and eight words explain what a streak was. That was it. And it
[01:41] was a massive win because it really required like it really
[01:44] dumbed down here is exactly how the streak worked. And it
[01:48] really helped users just understand what they needed to
[01:51] do. And I think this is something that's like, you
[01:53] kind of constantly got to remind yourself, particularly if you
[01:56] work in tech in your building cool tech features, but your
[01:59] user base is not a bunch of tech workers. To like think about
[02:04] alright, who is my audience? And for us, it's not just like
[02:07] tech workers, I people in America, people all over the
[02:09] world of all ages of all cultures. And so making sure
[02:15] that your your your feature is even something as simple as
[02:18] the streak is understandable as critical.
[02:20] What was the actual copy? Do you remember?
[02:22] It was it's still I think it's still on the app on like,
[02:26] started a day to extend your streak, but miss a day and it
[02:30] resets something like that. Makes sense. Very clear. Yeah,
[02:34] words. I love that. Okay, and then when you say massive
[02:37] win, by the way, just to give people reference point, what
[02:39] do you think what does that look like? What is a massive
[02:41] win in this skill?
[02:42] Well, and it's in it's funny. I mean, this was and this
[02:44] was four years ago, but I think it was like in the
[02:46] order of magnitude of over 10,000 da us for us. And
[02:50] actually, maybe this small bit of context. So Duolingo
[02:53] really cares about the metric current user retention
[02:57] rate. Actually, our first ever Duolingo post with Lenny was
[03:01] the newsletter that our former head of product wrote
[03:03] Jorge,
[03:04] the still the single most popular newsletter post of
[03:06] all time in my newsletter across 300, I would
[03:08] highly recommend that if you are interested in this,
[03:10] give it a read. You know, to summarize, basically
[03:14] what we found is that if we wanted to drive da us and
[03:17] Duolingo cares, you know, our growth north star is da
[03:20] use the metric that is most effective, you know, where a
[03:24] percentage change that metric is as most effective at
[03:27] driving da use is current user retention rate. And this
[03:29] is just users who are not new or resurrected, getting
[03:32] them to come back tomorrow. And so most of the work
[03:35] that our teams do our retention based teams do is
[03:39] focused on Kerr. And so the retention team that I
[03:41] lead, focused on Kerr, just so happens to streak is
[03:45] the best feature at driving Kerr. And so this was
[03:48] this experiment was the biggest Kerr when that we
[03:51] had had. I was like a top three Kerr when anyway, for
[03:55] us, just this little copy, right? And as I say, like
[03:58] death copy a thousand different ways. Sometimes
[04:00] it's not the big beautiful feature, you know, that's
[04:03] going to drive the huge gains, huge gains. Sometimes
[04:05] it's just something simple as a few words.
[04:08] I love this. Okay, so when you said 10,000 days, I
[04:13] think that references you guys measure in incremental
[04:15] impact and absolute numbers of new daily users, you're
[04:18] going to drive with attributed to that experiment.
[04:20] So yeah, and we do both. I mean, we'll also look at
[04:24] like a lot of times I'll look at, you know, for
[04:26] retention, day one versus day seven versus day 14. A
[04:30] lot of what I'm looking for is for us to have a
[04:33] better day 14, excuse me, better day 14 impact and
[04:36] better day day one impact, because it means that
[04:38] users are retaining better over time. This is
[04:40] particularly for users that would see a feature
[04:42] multiple times. I just like absolute DAU numbers
[04:45] because as long as you're controlling for, you
[04:49] know, different biases like a recency bias or a
[04:52] novelty bias, it's a really easy way to just
[04:55] have an absolute comparison. You know, you start to
[04:58] look at percentage changes and then it's
[04:59] influenced by your treatment, you know, how
[05:01] many users saw the experiment, but at least,
[05:04] you know, an absolute number is easier in my
[05:08] mind to start compare. Again, there are
[05:09] doubt, you know, there are pitfalls with it, but
[05:11] we find that that's a pretty useful way.
[05:13] That lesson comes up a lot on this podcast than
[05:15] that approach to experiment. So yeah, you're in
[05:19] good company. Quick tangent. If there's not an
[05:23] answer to this, no problem. Coming back to the
[05:25] idea of just like experimenting like crazy
[05:27] and not creating a product that nobody wants to
[05:30] use anymore long term. Is there an example of
[05:32] an experiment that was positive that you all
[05:34] decided no, we don't actually think this is what
[05:37] we want in the product that ended up not
[05:38] chipping. You know, retention doesn't only work
[05:41] on the streak, although, you know, you would
[05:44] think we do most of our work is the streak.
[05:46] We've touched a lot of different surfaces
[05:47] over the years and there was one experiment
[05:48] that we launched that, you know, we talked
[05:50] about XP earlier in the lesson. The only UI
[05:53] elements are a progress bar at the top and
[05:55] then how many hearts you have, right? So we
[05:57] keep it really simple and this very much
[05:59] speaks to the design, you know, philosophy
[06:02] of Duolingo, which is simpler UI is
[06:04] better. And we decided, hey, let's add XP
[06:08] in there and so let's show your XP ticking
[06:10] up as you're going, you know, through a
[06:12] lesson and that's going to make the user
[06:13] feel good. It's going to give, you know,
[06:15] show you what you've earned, you're going
[06:16] to be less likely to quit all of these
[06:17] good reasons to do it. And then you
[06:19] finish the lesson and then we'll show
[06:20] you've collected all this XP. And it
[06:22] won, I mean, the hypothesis was a good
[06:24] one. But we realized and I remember
[06:27] having this conversation with Louise is
[06:29] like, cool, this is our most important
[06:31] screen in the app. It is our lesson is
[06:33] where users learn and the focus here
[06:35] is on learning. And now you've added
[06:37] this other thing up there
[06:40] to distract, you know, that could be
[06:42] distracting for users. And I think the
[06:43] question, you know, we talked about
[06:44] road maps and strategy here, the
[06:45] question that he had for me and I
[06:47] didn't have a good answer for at the
[06:48] time was like, so what else are you
[06:49] going to do with us? Like, what's
[06:52] your iteration ideas? Where is this
[06:53] going to go? Is this going to make
[06:55] the, you know, lesson experience
[06:56] more gamified or and what we
[06:59] realized is that like, honestly, it
[07:01] was kind of just a, you know, an easy
[07:03] engagement when idea, but we had
[07:05] touched our most, you know, sacred
[07:07] space in the app to do that.
[07:09] And so that was the case where it's
[07:11] like, yeah, it was a nice win, but we
[07:13] added that UI element. And, you
[07:16] know, at least at the time, it was
[07:18] less clear what we would do with
[07:20] them. We realized that like long
[07:21] term, it was just going to get in
[07:22] the way. And we'd rather for a
[07:24] simplicity sake, pause that, you
[07:27] know, shut it down and keep the
[07:29] lesson, you know, to be the a
[07:31] little bit of learning sink sanctuary
[07:32] was now it's funny. Nowadays, I
[07:34] think we actually have enough XP
[07:36] based mechanics and fun things that
[07:37] we can do that, like, I think
[07:39] actually a lot of our, you know, the
[07:42] beliefs about the lesson experience
[07:43] have changed, something like that
[07:45] could work. But at the time, you
[07:46] know, didn't feel good to keep that
[07:48] around. That was an awesome
[07:49] example. Hopefully we have time to
[07:52] talk about how the team operates
[07:54] where my mind goes is like, Oh, but
[07:56] you have all these PMs and teams
[07:57] don't want to show impact and
[07:58] the performance reviews and all that
[07:59] stuff and you're shipping, you're
[08:00] not shipping something. They're like,
[08:01] Oh, look, we did a win. So I
[08:03] want to chat about that later. But
[08:05] let's keep going on things you've
[08:06] learned and things that didn't work
[08:07] on the journey. The other thing
[08:09] that I'll call out with the
[08:12] streak, you know, it's like we
[08:13] have the the image of the streak
[08:16] is this flame, right? And, you
[08:18] know, we have the streak flame
[08:19] and it's very much corridor
[08:20] iconography. It's important to
[08:22] acknowledge that that's a
[08:23] metaphor for a retention mechanic,
[08:25] like the idea of keeping a flame
[08:27] lit. And again, if you think
[08:29] we've we've established the
[08:30] flame as, you know, for a lot of
[08:31] users as sort of their
[08:32] understanding of a streak, which
[08:33] is great. But there's a lot of
[08:35] people, you know, in different
[08:37] cultural context and different,
[08:38] you know, stages of life where
[08:40] the idea of like keeping a flame
[08:42] lit to show your commitment to
[08:43] something makes less sense. We
[08:47] did some UXR in India many
[08:48] years ago. And this was
[08:49] something that just like did
[08:50] not resonate at all there,
[08:52] which was, which was a
[08:53] really interesting learning. And
[08:54] that's something that's like
[08:54] again, depending upon what your
[08:55] user base is, like the more
[08:57] global UXR you can do to
[08:59] understand how users are
[09:00] actually understanding and
[09:01] experience your feature, the
[09:02] better, because you just again,
[09:03] encounter insights like this.
[09:05] And so even our screen design,
[09:07] you know, we used to have a
[09:08] flame. It was just it was
[09:10] mostly this flame that would
[09:11] like light up every day. But
[09:12] again, it was like an
[09:13] indication of a metaphor for a
[09:14] mechanic. And when we
[09:16] redesigned it, we did this
[09:18] Kurt or one of our animators
[09:20] did this awesome odometer
[09:22] animation where it's like
[09:22] your number would tick every
[09:24] day. It kind of like looked
[09:26] good. But from a product
[09:27] perspective, it was cool is we
[09:29] actually focused the design on
[09:30] the screen to show your
[09:32] number going up. And then it
[09:34] would say, you know, like seven
[09:35] day streak, eight day streak.
[09:38] And I think that as you're
[09:38] thinking about designing around
[09:40] a streak, don't get too bought
[09:41] up, you know, or caught up
[09:43] into like, what is this, you
[09:45] know, like the beautiful story
[09:47] that you're trying to tell at
[09:48] the expense of it being a
[09:50] really comprehensible feature.
[09:51] And so as you're thinking
[09:52] about product design, making
[09:54] that product design a clear
[09:55] distillation of this is what
[09:57] we're actually tracking, you
[09:59] know, form should follow a
[10:00] function here, you know, was a
[10:02] was it was a learning for us.
[10:03] And you'll see that now in a
[10:04] lot of places where we're
[10:05] showing streak, we're really
[10:07] leading with the number, not
[10:08] necessarily the flame.
[10:10] That's all that's a theme
[10:12] that I'm hearing again and
[10:13] again is clarity. Don't
[10:15] obsess with making it too
[10:17] thought like clever and don't
[10:19] ever think it just like
[10:20] clarity has a big impact.
[10:22] Clarity also doesn't have to
[10:23] come at the expense of
[10:24] delight. And this is
[10:25] something where, you know,
[10:27] you hit a milestone and
[10:28] duo gets that, you know, it
[10:30] becomes we call him a Phoenix
[10:31] duo, and he becomes awesome
[10:33] and, you know, lights on fire.
[10:34] And I think there are things
[10:36] that you can do to still make
[10:37] the experience really exciting
[10:39] and delightful and
[10:40] celebratory. And I would I
[10:42] would not lose that, but just
[10:43] don't do it at the expense.
[10:45] And I think it's also about
[10:46] figuring out for what, you
[10:47] know, you can get away with
[10:48] doing more of this for users
[10:50] who are deeper into their
[10:51] streak experience than users
[10:53] who are starting where it's
[10:53] like your goal for the one
[10:55] day streak users just to
[10:56] make sure do they understand
[10:58] how this feature works.
[10:59] I mean, even something again,
[11:00] just like another random
[11:01] experiment at the bottom of
[11:03] the streak screen, we have a
[11:04] calendar. And over the
[11:06] years, it just looks more and
[11:08] more calendar like. And that
[11:09] is simply because we find
[11:10] that the more we make it look
[11:12] like a calendar, days on top,
[11:14] you know, little circles,
[11:15] the check, like the more we
[11:16] make it look like calendar,
[11:17] the more that people realize,
[11:18] hey, this is a day, a
[11:19] daily mechanic. And so think
[11:21] about the screen
[11:22] holistically, but every
[11:23] single thing that you're
[11:24] doing on the screen, how
[11:25] can you use it to communicate?
[11:27] What is the point of this
[11:28] feature? How does it work?

[12:36] I imagine one of the biggest
[12:37] wins was just giving people
[12:39] flexibility, flexibility
[12:40] along the journey like streak
[12:42] freezes and all these things
[12:43] is that is that a big vein
[12:44] of opportunity discovery?
[12:45] It is it is great.
[12:46] Actually, I'm going to show
[12:48] you the one of the most
[12:49] thoughtful gifts that
[12:50] anybody has ever given to
[12:50] me. This is our duolingo
[12:52] serenity or streak serenity
[12:54] prayer, my colleague Antonia.
[12:56] It's like knitted, right?
[12:57] It's like for me. It's amazing.
[12:59] And so it says, Louise, grant
[13:01] me the serenity to accept
[13:02] the flexibility I need the
[13:03] courage to reach perfection
[13:05] when I can and the wisdom
[13:06] to celebrate regardless.
[13:07] And that actually is like
[13:10] kind of our strategy with
[13:11] the streak. So the show
[13:12] and tell by the way, that was
[13:13] great. Yeah, I will.
[13:14] I guess for, you know,
[13:15] podcast listeners will have
[13:16] to, you know, get an image
[13:17] somewhere. The this idea
[13:20] of like flexibility versus
[13:22] perfection and then
[13:23] regardless celebration is
[13:25] core to how we think about
[13:26] the street. Because, you know,
[13:27] I think for the streak for us,
[13:28] it's very much a bend not
[13:29] break. You know, I if you're
[13:31] going to miss a day, I'd
[13:33] rather you come back, you
[13:35] know, having not, you know,
[13:36] having missed that day to
[13:37] an intact streak. But if
[13:39] you don't have to miss a
[13:40] day, much rather you don't
[13:42] and much rather you come
[13:42] back and use the app every
[13:44] day. So that that thing
[13:47] on flexibility, though,
[13:48] that's almost certainly been
[13:49] the biggest, you know,
[13:50] from a mechanic perspective,
[13:51] the biggest.
