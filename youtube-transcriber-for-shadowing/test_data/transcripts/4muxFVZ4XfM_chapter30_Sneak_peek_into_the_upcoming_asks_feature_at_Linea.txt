============================================================

[00:00] For the actual final question, before we get to a very exciting
[00:03] lightning round, what's just the future linear?
[00:05] What's coming?
[00:05] What's happening in the future?
[00:07] Anything can share.
[00:08] Yeah, I think there's always things we're working on and improving.
[00:11] One, like a newer thing we're working on is this feature called asks.
[00:16] And basically what it is is that we see that like in a company,
[00:22] there can be a lot of different people that needs to interact with
[00:25] the product team or different people that needs to interact with this
[00:28] team, but they are not necessarily like in linear or part of this team.
[00:33] So we would be building this like an ask future, which is like integration
[00:38] to Slack where you can very easily like go to a Slack channel and
[00:41] then ask like so your question like you need something from this
[00:45] team, like maybe it's it team that like you need like a laptop
[00:48] or maybe it's like the like infrastructure team and you need
[00:52] like help them like you need something from them.
[00:55] Then the team that this is handling the request, they can very
[01:00] easily like send it to to linear into this like triage that we have.
[01:04] And then like they can start like doing stuff with it.
[01:08] And if they have like questions or or just like additional
[01:11] questions to the actual person who requested it, we can like send
[01:15] those messages back to the person through Slack.
[01:17] So they don't actually have to go to to linear or they
[01:20] don't have to be a linear user to use it.
[01:23] So we think like this is like just like a good way for the company
[01:27] or or the whole company to be more potentially involved in the
[01:31] in the company like the product operations without like having
[01:34] to be like a like a power user of linear or or because
[01:39] not every function really uses it or or needs to use it.
