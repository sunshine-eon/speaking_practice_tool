============================================================

[00:00] So, I think keeping things simple is also really important.
[00:04] And then I think the last thing I'll say is, it's important to understand how metrics across
[00:11] the company equate to one another.
[00:13] And so we spend a lot of time quantifying things in terms of a common currency.
[00:22] So for example, if I were to lower price by a dollar, what would I get in terms of
[00:28] volume?
[00:29] Well, what if I lower delivery times by a minute?
[00:34] What do I get for that in terms of volume?
[00:37] And so now you can make trade-offs between maybe your marketing team and your logistics team,
[00:43] because you have this common currency that everyone can talk about.
[00:48] And so we've done that.
[00:49] We've tried to quantify all of the levers of our business, price, selection, quality
[00:56] in common terms, so that if we have, say, a dollar to spend, we know what we get depending
[01:03] on where we put it over what time frame.
[01:07] And I think that that helps us make decisions more quickly, because we sort of know what
[01:14] our options are.
[01:15] We know that we have our inventory of things that we can do, short-term, long-term,
[01:20] and what we get for it.
[01:21] So it definitely helps us to make decisions more quickly and hopefully better decisions.
[01:27] These are so awesome.
[01:28] I definitely want to follow up on some of this.
[01:30] This is so good.
[01:31] So maybe on this last one, which we did at Airbnb also, just like, how does everything
[01:36] translate into Knight's book and booking?
[01:39] Every decision we make, what is the actual Knight's book impact?
[01:43] And so I imagine in your case, I don't know if you want to talk about these things,
[01:45] I imagine it's like transactions or purchases or GMV or something like that, I'm guessing
[01:50] it's the final metric.
[01:51] I don't know, is that something you talk about or we don't talk about that?
[01:55] So I mean, we measure things in terms of GOV, so gross order value and also volume.
[02:03] Got it.
[02:04] Great.
[02:05] Okay.
[02:06] So basically every other metric that people are goaled on as much as you can, can translate.
[02:10] There's a model that translates that into gross order value and volume.
[02:15] Awesome.
[02:16] And then a team is saying, like, hey, we're going to change the onboarding flow and impact
[02:20] conversion here.
[02:21] And I don't know, I guess, yeah, what are some examples of other metrics on teams that
[02:25] potentially translate into GOV and volume just to make it even more real?
[02:30] Yeah.
[02:31] So everything from the example that you started with, which is like an improvement
[02:36] in the login flow, right?
[02:39] How many more consumers are getting onto the app and ultimately placing orders?
[02:45] And so you can translate that to, of course, orders and GOV.
[02:48] But then something as interesting as selling a Thai restaurant in Sacramento, right?
[02:57] We're able to say, what do we think that that gets us in terms of GOV from the consumer
[03:02] by selling that Thai restaurant?
[03:04] So it's every area of the business.
[03:07] It's mobilizing more dashers on the road.
[03:11] What does that do to our quality metrics in terms of delivery times?
[03:15] How does that translate?
[03:17] And so because of that, we're able to figure out if we want to spend the dollar or spend
[03:24] the time, the team's time on improving conversion or spending more money in marketing or onboarding
[03:33] more dashers or signing more restaurants or adding more grocery stores, right?
[03:39] So we're able to look kind of across the whole business and figure out what is the right
[03:45] mix of actions to take to achieve our goals.
[03:48] I could see as you talk about this, why this is so important in a marketplace, especially
[03:52] a multi-sided marketplace where there's always trade-off decisions between supply investment
[03:56] and demand growth and dasher growth.
[03:59] I don't even know.
[04:00] My brain would explode trying to think about all these things.
[04:02] So I get exactly why this is so important to business.
[04:06] Okay.
[04:07] And then in terms of the simple recommendation, I think when people are here, like, yeah, keep
[04:11] it simple, they're like, yeah, yeah, we're going to keep it simple.
[04:14] What are some things that point to this is not simple that tell you like, no, this is
[04:18] way too complicated.
[04:19] You should try to simplify this metric, even though it's not ideal, it's not the
[04:22] perfect metric, but it needs to be simpler.
[04:25] Yeah.
[04:26] We had a score from Merchant Health, which we tried experimenting with, which was a combination
[04:37] of factors that we had found would lead to a merchant being on the platform and getting
[04:43] an order.
[04:44] So we wanted to make sure that the merchant had active hours on the platform and had
[04:50] images and had a full menu that was accurate and robust and a number of different inputs
[04:56] and we created a composite that weighted all of these different inputs.
[05:00] And then we were like, what is our Merchant Health score?
[05:03] Right.
[05:04] And you were like, it's, you know, 0.35, it's not 35%, so like, what is that?
[05:12] What is like that 0.35, I don't know what it is.
[05:16] So instead of that, we said, what are the most important factors in order?
[05:21] First, let's measure how many of the new merchants are getting an order within
[05:24] their first, say, seven days on the platform.
[05:27] And then let's look at how many of our merchants are doing these things we know are important,
[05:32] so these inputs.
[05:33] So let's goal our team on getting like merchant photo coverage up.
[05:39] Let's goal the team on making sure that we have open hours, accurate hours, right?
[05:44] So figuring instead of, yes, someone might say it's simpler to have a composite metric,
[05:50] but it was so hard to understand what it was and how to move it that it became meaningless.
[05:57] And ultimately, moving to something that was simpler to understand, even if it meant having
[06:03] three metrics instead of one, it ultimately was better for the team because folks knew
[06:09] what they were trying to move.
[06:11] And so, yeah, maybe we missed number four, five, and six on the list of things, but
[06:16] you got one through three, and that's 95% of it anyway.
[06:20] So once we get success with that 95, then let's talk about figuring out the other 5%.
[06:26] It's so funny because this is exactly what we went through at Airbnb.
[06:30] We had a, we called it a healthy host.
[06:31] I led the host quality team for a while, and we came up with this healthy host metric
[06:36] that was six factors of a host, like their cancellation rate, their review rate, their
[06:41] response rate, and things like that.
[06:43] And then we're just like, cool, let's move this, let's make more hosts healthy.
[06:46] And then you end up like, okay, well, which one do we focus on?
[06:49] And what about all these others?
[06:51] And we ended up basically focusing on one at a time.
[06:53] And so let's just make that the goal for now and then rotate through the different biggest
[06:57] lever opportunities to move the program.
[06:59] Exactly.
[07:00] I think in hindsight, for the example you give, which of those six things are actually
[07:04] the most important, right?
[07:06] And if you're able to then quantify which one matters most, you work on that one
[07:10] first, and you materially move that one, and then you work on the next one.
[07:15] You want to move them all, but like being able to prioritize and know what you're going
[07:19] to get for a 20% improvement in, say, your cancellation rate, right?
[07:24] That's where analytics, I think, can add a lot of value because, yes, ultimately you'll
[07:27] get to all of them.
[07:29] But the way you do that and the time can have a meaningful impact on your growth.
[07:35] If you can target the most problematic things first and solve those, you get more bang
[07:40] for your buck, and that compounds over time.
[07:43] And so doing the things that matter first and most quickly is a competitive advantage,
[07:50] in my opinion.
[07:51] The other thing we found along those same lines is rotating between different metrics is so
[07:55] not efficient because you get good at, we're going to move this metric and your team's
[07:59] like, cool, we totally understand this lever, like cancellation rate.
[08:03] We become really smart at cancellation rate.
[08:05] And then three months later, you need to switch to response rate and they have
[08:09] to learn a whole new paradigm of how to think about it and it's just super inefficient.
[08:13] So we found basically just like keep a team on the metric until there's no more opportunities
[08:18] and give another team one of these other metrics.
[08:22] So many lessons.
[08:23] Okay.
[08:24] And the first thing you said on how to pick a good metric about this idea of short
[08:27] term metric that have long term impact, how did you phrase that again?
[08:32] Yeah.
[08:33] So we find proxy metrics for long term outcomes.
[08:35] Awesome.
[08:36] It's similar to the simple metric and it all comes down to, again, just like the metric
[08:42] should be something you probably, you can move, you can understand.
[08:46] That's close enough to this ideal, perfect metric, but it's not necessarily the entire
[08:50] idea.
[08:51] Okay.
[08:52] Also, many things on these lines of just like picking metrics, working with metrics
[08:55] that you've learned that would be worth.
