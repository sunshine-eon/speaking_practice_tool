And also the other thing we're doing is, as you know, Lenny, we're spending a lot of money in performance marketing. I don't think performance marketing is a bad thing. I think of performance marketing as a laser. Actually, my co-founder, who obviously you know well, Joe, used to have this metaphor of lasers, flash bulbs, and chandeliers. If you want to light up a room, performance marketing is a laser. It can light up a corner of a room. You don't want to use a bunch of lasers to light up an entire room; you should use a chandelier. And that's what brand marketing is. 

But if you do need a laser in balance, supply and demand, then performance marketing is really good. It literally lasers in. Performance marketing, though, doesn't create very good accumulating advantages because it's not an investment. Now, if you want to build it permanently, like booking.com, if you have a really high ROI, now you can have a performance marketing arbitrage business. But assuming you don't want to arbitrage business, you actually need to be investing. 

And so we think of marketing as education; we're educating people on the unique benefits. A lot of companies don't do product marketing. They do brand marketing, which are ads about the app, or they do performance marketing, but they're never really educating people about new things they're making and shipping. Because no one's marketing new things that are shipping, there's no purpose to ship new things. You ship new things, and if people don't know about them or use them or they're not educated, then you try these big new things, and people don't adopt them immediately. So then you get more and more incremental.
