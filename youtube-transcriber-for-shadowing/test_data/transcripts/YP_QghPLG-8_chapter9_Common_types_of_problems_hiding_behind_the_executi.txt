============================================================

[00:00] So you talked about execution and how maybe for early stage startups that might be default,
[00:05] the most important type of work to be focused on.
[00:07] And that's actually a really good lead way to our fourth big idea, which is kind of a provocative tweet that you put out a while ago that you said that most execution problems are actually strategy problems or culture problems.
[00:22] And so I'm excited to hear a little bit more about kind of how you discovered that and what that means and and maybe how to address those problems.
[00:30] Yeah.
[00:30] And so I realized this somewhat late in my career as a leader that most execution problems that I encounter in a high performing environment where everybody has the right intentions are actually not execution problems.
[00:51] They are either strategy problems or interpersonal problems or cultural problems.
[00:59] And so just to illustrate it, I'll make the observation that many leaders are extremely busy in such environments, whether it's a fast growth startup or a fast growth larger company.
[01:10] They're extremely busy.
[01:11] They're usually overwhelmed.
[01:13] Like I said earlier, I was one of those people.
[01:16] And when you take a deeper look at what they're engaged in, and I got a chance to look at it with my peers that I was kind of mentoring or coaching or people on my team, PMs or PM leaders who are like extremely busy.
[01:28] And usually overwhelmed.
