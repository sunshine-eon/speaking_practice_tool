============================================================

[00:00] Okay, next topic that I'm excited to get your take on is is game design versus gamification
[00:05] This is some one of the more unique ways you think about designing product and when people hear you talk about this
[00:11] They think it's like oh gamification making things like games. Oh, that's Zynga Farmville. I don't want to do that
[00:15] We actually have a really different perspective on how to make why you need to think about game design as you design products
[00:22] Talk about your insights there
[00:24] Yeah, well, I strongly believe that we should make business software like we make games
[00:30] Because when we make products like we make games people find them fun
[00:36] They tell their friends they fall in love with them
[00:38] It's another way actually backing into where we open this conversation, which is you're making a brand
[00:45] You're giving reason for word of mouth. It's actually an altogether different kind of products development
[00:51] So how do we do this? Well, as you said, it's not gamification. That doesn't work
[00:56] Game design works the game design is not gamification. It's not for example
[01:01] It's simply taking your product and adding points levels trophies or badges and to understand why
[01:09] gamification does not work
[01:10] We actually have to start with human motivation and there's a very interesting study from
[01:16] Stanford I think that demonstrates the difference perfectly in the 1970s these Stanford researchers
[01:23] Recruited children who were age three to four years old and all of these kids were generally
[01:28] Pre-interested in drawing
[01:29] Some kids were told they would get a reward a certificate with a gold seal and a ribbon
[01:34] And some kids were not told about any reward and they did not even expect one or didn't know of one
[01:39] Now each child was then invited into a separate room to draw for six minutes and afterwards
[01:45] They would either get the reward or not and over the next few days
[01:50] The children were observed to see how much they would continue to draw by themselves
[01:55] So the children with no reward they spent
[01:59] 17% of their time drawing
[02:02] But the children who expected a reward
[02:05] Sadly they only spent eight percent of their time drawing the very presence of a reward
[02:11] Halved their motivation. So what's happening?
[02:14] What's happening here is researchers differentiate intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation with intrinsic motivation
[02:22] We do things because they are inherently interesting and satisfying and with extrinsic motivation
[02:27] We do things to earn rewards and to achieve external goals
[02:31] And that's the problem with rewards is they just massively undermine
[02:35] Intrinsic motivation and that's why gamification doesn't work and when gamification does work
[02:40] It's because the underlying experience was already designed like a game. What makes something
[02:46] I guess like a game. I know superhuman is really good at this of just like you're in box zero
[02:52] Quest that you're on I guess just to make that a little more real. What is game design?
[02:55] What does that mean to you? Like what makes it feel like a game?
[02:58] Well, many of you folks don't know this but before I was a founder you can probably tell I was actually a
[03:04] professionally a game designer and as it turns out there is no unifying theory of game design
[03:10] To create games what we need to do is draw upon the arts and the science of psychology
[03:15] mathematics storytelling interaction design and at superhuman we've identified five key areas
[03:22] That we really care about
[03:24] Goals emotions toys controls and flow and across these we've identified many principles of game design
[03:31] And one example principle would be
[03:34] Make fun toys and then combine those into games
[03:39] So a question I like to ask is are toys the same as games?
[03:43] They do seem different for example, we play with toys, but we play games
[03:50] A ball is a toy the football is a game
[03:53] And as it turns out the best games are constructed out of toys
[03:58] Why because then they are fun on both levels the toy and the game itself
[04:02] So for example in superhuman
[04:05] One of our favorite toys is
[04:07] The time auto-completer if you use superhuman
[04:10] This is the thing that appears when you hit H when you snooze or set reminders on emails
[04:15] You can type whatever you want it can be gibberish and it does its best to understand you
[04:20] For example, if you type in 2d that becomes two days 3h is three hours one mo is one month
[04:26] And the time auto-completer is fun because it indulges your playful exploration
[04:32] In onboardings. It wasn't long before I saw people asking
[04:36] What can it do? Where does it break? How does it work?
[04:40] What happens if I keep on typing in a series of tens? Well, it turns out that's October the 10th at 10 10 p.m
[04:46] Or how about the series of twos? Well, that's February the 2nd 2022 at 2 p.m
[04:51] And then you start trying more complex inputs like in a fortnight and a day and that works
[04:58] Which is a pleasant surprise and it's not long before you find more pleasant surprises like time zone math happens without you thinking about it
[05:05] You can just type in 8 a.m in Tokyo and it turns out that's 8 p.m
[05:09] Eastern time and you no longer have to do the time zone math and then most people were really delighted to find out that
[05:15] If you really want you can snooze emails until never I you can literally type in never and the email will never come back
[05:21] And I had like a little shrug emoji
[05:24] at the same time
[05:25] So, you know, is it is this toy going to win awards? Nope, but is it fun? Actually surprisingly?
[05:32] Yes, so what I would encourage people to do is think about the features of their product
[05:38] Do those features indulge playful exploration?
[05:41] Are they fun even without a goal and do they elicit moments of pleasant surprise?
[05:47] If so, you have a toy and you can combine that with other toys and actually start to build a game
[05:54] If people were to listen to this segment of the podcast, they would never guess we're talking about B2B
[05:59] software and email
