Fighting for it. Someone's trying to think about, okay, I want to get better as a PM, and I'm going to try to start simplifying. What are examples of simplifying? Is it reducing your email length? Is it a one-pager focus? What are these buckets of things? And then, also, if there's an example of something you've simplified that comes to mind.

On what to simplify and more specifics, I would say anything can be simplified and shortened. Maybe another way to say it is to shorten it. Definitely emails. I read them and sometimes don't love them. Make them short. The Minto principle is something that I would recommend everyone do, which is to put the headline, the full conclusion first, and then your supporting argument second. I have a newsletter post about that exact concept that we'll link in the show notes, which gives you exactly how to use the Minto pyramid principle. Yes, everyone should do that.

A lot of new PMs fall into the trap of thinking that they should have some sort of buildup. Don't do that. Just tell me whatever the thing is. Thank you. Doing things like that, like you said, limiting your strategy docs, your conclusions, and your next steps to three things maximum. I would generally say a rule of thumb would be that pretty much every doc you write, you can delete the first two paragraphs that you've written. You don't need them.

My dad, again, to go back to my dad, when I would write in the sound scroll, but I promise it wasn't, when I would write a paper for school, he would just take away the first page and he'd be like, just start here. Everything he would go, everything on the first page is crap, don't use it. He wouldn't even read it, which would drive me crazy. He would just say, it's crap, I don't care about that. So I would do that.
