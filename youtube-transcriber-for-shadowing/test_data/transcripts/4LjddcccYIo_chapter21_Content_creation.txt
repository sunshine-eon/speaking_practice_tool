Chapter 21: Content creation
Video: Mastering product strategy and growing as a PM | Maggie Crowley (Toast, Drift, TripAdvisor)
Time: 61:10 - 74:27
============================================================

[00:00] Okay. Another topic that you have some interesting opinions about is product content. Very close
[00:05] to our hearts, both my heart and your heart. Do share.
[00:10] Really if you're going to make good content, like you have to sanitize and frameworkize
[00:17] the thing that you're working on. And then slowly I think for a lot of people who are
[00:24] reading it and looking at it, they like their thinking starts to become, well, look how well
[00:30] I did this framework, look how well I implemented this thing. And they lose touch with the point
[00:36] which is like creating impact. And so all of this content makes it really noisy and then
[00:42] makes people think that like, oh, if I just do these things that I'll get what I want.
[00:46] And I'll just check off my list. And then I checked it off and then I should get my
[00:49] promotion at the end of the day. But it's like the best PMs have built up so many different
[00:55] frameworks and they can apply them in different ways. And then sometimes they throw them out.
[00:58] And they, you know, they say, nothing I have in my toolkit makes sense for this moment.
[01:02] But I know what to do because, you know, I have intuition and I have data and I've talked to
[01:05] users or whatever. And so content sometimes can get in the way of the impact because
[01:10] you're trying to apply it. And you think that the point is the framework and the
[01:13] point is the one page or whatever it is that you're doing when it's not.
[01:16] And then if you're a leader and maybe if you've had the good and ill fortune of having
[01:22] published content, someone comes to you and says, well, you said in that one podcast episode that
[01:26] you don't believe in roadmaps. So like, why are you asking me for a roadmap?
[01:29] And then you're the asshole who's sitting there being like, well,
[01:32] it's like a little more complicated than that. And, you know, that was a fun take that I
[01:36] had. But like, I actually need to understand what we're doing because we're planning and
[01:38] like, I need to figure out what my budget is, blah, blah, blah.
[01:41] That's so funny that I didn't think about like you as a leader having put stuff out that
[01:45] people put back at you. And I think your point about one for you, for people to consume
[01:52] content online about how to do product management, you have to like really distill it. And to your
[01:57] point, it often loses the nuance because if you had all the nuance, no one's going to even read
[02:01] it because it's so complicated and long. Right. And then the other point of,
[02:05] there's also just like, it has to be interesting. So if it's another just like,
[02:09] here's how to roadmap early successfully. And it's like what everyone's already done.
[02:12] No one's going to read it. So you always have to kind of have a new take. And with that comes
[02:17] like, that's not actually always true. I just kind of wanted people to react to this idea.
[02:22] Yeah. I mean, it's helpful. I think all of the, there's some people who create, I mean,
[02:28] there's many things about my last role. We would, we all had your newsletter and we listened
[02:33] to the show and then people would bring, I can't, I should have found a clip, but I
[02:36] can't remember. There were a couple of moments where we would listen to a piece of it or find
[02:41] an article and say like, oh, like this could help or what if we did it that way?
[02:45] I think there was a newsletter article about Figma and they had some templates. They're like
[02:50] product review template from Fig Jam. Love that one. Use that one all the time. Amazing.
[02:56] And so, yeah, I mean, this stuff's really useful. It's just like you have to be
[03:00] smart about when you apply it. And then if you're a leader and there's all this
[03:03] content available, you have to be, you have to know why you're not following the rules.
[03:07] Right. Like if they're just like, hey, look at this newsletter post-lining right,
[03:11] we should be doing it this way versus like, I think people assume these are the one way to do it or
[03:17] innately will work at your company. And I really like your point, which, you know,
[03:22] maybe counter to what I do, but I think it's an important nuance that I feel like I should add
[03:26] to every newsletter. This isn't necessarily going to work at your company. Like sometimes
[03:30] there's the culture is different and this won't fit or this isn't a complete version.
[03:36] As much as I try to give people, here's everything you need to do this thing well,
[03:40] there's always a little bit missing.
[03:41] Within it can be a little, I think if you don't have that context, it can be a little demoralizing
[03:47] because it's like, well, how am I ever going to do that thing that they get to do at this
[03:51] magical company? But again, if you view it as more like, hear all the tools that you can
[03:55] add to your toolkit and you pull them out and you're in a situation from which they
[03:58] can be useful. That's how I think about it versus like this is the one way to do it. Like
[04:03] you said, you know, the only way you can write a one page or the only way you can run an
[04:07] experiment, it's more like you can do it in many different ways.
[04:09] Yeah. And I find myself, I'm not actually, I rarely tell people here's the way to do it.
[04:15] Usually what I try to describe is here's how the best companies do it as much as I can get into
[04:21] and leave it to the reader to decide, is this going to be a fit for me? Should I try to
[04:25] implement it? But still, I think there's an implication. This is the way to do
[04:28] research. Here's the way to do roadmap. Here's the way to purchase.
[04:32] But I think it's interesting that you also yourself create a lot of content and you've,
[04:37] you actually found a lot of value from being a, I don't know, let's not call you content creator
[04:42] because I don't want, I don't like being labeled as a creator myself. Someone once called me a
[04:45] product influencer and I died like a little bit. That's how I feel. I'd love to hear
[04:52] just the impact you've seen from spending time creating podcasts and blog posts and tweeting
[04:56] about really great stuff because a lot of people are thinking about investing in this stuff.
[05:01] Yeah. It's probably the best thing I've ever done for my career and I'm so grateful for the people who
[05:10] whose idea it was, who supported me, especially adrift when that became such a part of what we
[05:15] were doing at that time. And it's been helpful for a couple of reasons. One is just networking and
[05:23] access. I probably wouldn't be here today if I hadn't done that and if friend of a friend
[05:30] had read the thing, it's like it just creates so many more connections and so access to people
[05:35] and networking is one of the first benefits. Also, building a personal brand is really helpful.
[05:46] One of the things that I always wanted to do with my career is try to make it so that
[05:51] I'm always employable. I just didn't want to like,
[05:55] you know, I'm an 08 grad not to put my age out there and it was a hard time. And so I've always
[06:00] had this in the back of my mind. You want to be able to have a solid career and so I thought that
[06:04] investing in my personal brand would be a way to help me get access to roles. It helps in
[06:10] recruiting as well when I'm trying to hire people because a lot of my job now is bringing
[06:15] people in and because I've been vocal about how I like to work and who I am,
[06:19] a lot of people self-select and they will send me a note and say,
[06:22] I want to work with you or I want to work on a team like that and that's huge because if my
[06:26] job is to hire people, then that's great and people can get a sense of who I am
[06:31] without needing to be on the phone with me. My favorite benefit outside of those things has been
[06:37] that it's helped me learn more from the work I've done than I otherwise would have been able
[06:42] to because in order to make content, you have to think through what you did. You have to
[06:48] summarize it, process it, make it interesting for people and then especially if it's in a podcast
[06:54] medium, talk to somebody about it and the process of doing that means that you're paying attention
[06:58] to what you're learning along the way and so often we don't do that because we're busy working,
[07:03] we have our lives, things are happening and that to me is I think what's made me a better
[07:09] product person faster is because I spent the time to think about what I was doing in a way
[07:13] that I wouldn't know if I wasn't, if I didn't have to write something down.
[07:17] Something that comes across in your content that you've somehow figured out is to avoid it being
[07:23] cringy and very thirsty for followers and I think when a lot of people here build a
[07:30] personal brand it's like, I don't want to. I know, it makes me ill even saying that.
[07:34] Yeah, okay. I never thought of it. I wanted to think of it that way
[07:39] and I'm just curious what advice you'd give to people that want to go down this route without
[07:44] feeling. I guess one is just feeling like they're being cringy and to avoiding
[07:48] content people will be like, oh my god, I can't believe this stuff.
[07:52] Yeah, the clickbait, tweet thread situation. I think the step one is going to be cringe.
[08:00] Like your first 10, 20, however many posts are going to be bad, I would imagine if you
[08:06] went back and listened to your first episode you would be cringing just because you've learned
[08:10] so much since then, right? Like it's natural. Yeah, although randomly the second, the first episode
[08:15] ever is the most popular episode, yes, with Shreyas, which I could see why it was so popular.
[08:19] Yeah, so you started it, like went really hot with your first guest.
[08:24] That's right, that's right. So yeah, first get over the fact that it's going to be cringe,
[08:27] it's going to be cringe. Like anything, you just have to get started and it'll fade away
[08:33] eventually and you don't have to think about it. To be, this is such gross advice, but like you
[08:40] have to be authentic. It has to be real. And I think what came through in this show that I did was like,
[08:46] those were my real questions that I was really working on. So we joked about how we would turn
[08:50] off the recording and then we would get the real story. But I would turn the recording off
[08:55] and I would say, okay, we talked about this thing. Here's what's actually happening in my job
[08:58] today. What would you do? And so those were real questions that I had, real processes that I was
[09:04] working on, and real advice that I needed at that time. And I think that's why it was valuable,
[09:08] it's because I was actively a PM. And the way that I'm still actively in product,
[09:15] that was always something that I wanted because it meant that the content had to be relevant
[09:19] for me and wasn't just for likes and shares. I think there's some two really important
[09:25] points there that stood out to me. One is your stuff is going to be terrible if you don't actually
[09:29] have any background or experience in the thing. So you're just pretending. It's like you're acting
[09:34] like someone that knows about this thing, but you don't actually. And so I think that's an
[09:38] incredibly important part of this is don't try to become an online creator person if you
[09:45] haven't done the thing because people will see that you don't know what you're really talking
[09:48] about and you'll run out of stuff and it'll be like, okay, well, I did it for two months
[09:51] and I have nothing more to say. Right. Right. And then the other piece is there's a guest who
[09:58] shared this quote that has stuck with me from Einstein, which is something like seek not to be
[10:03] successful, but of value. And I find that that's a really good framing for sharing stuff. It's
[10:10] just like share things that are interesting to you and useful and come at it from like this
[10:14] is useful, not from I'm trying to build a following because people can tell if that's
[10:20] yeah, people can absolutely tell. And the other thing is there's a little bit of like
[10:25] too cool for school mixed in here. And there are definitely people who will
[10:31] tell you your content is cringe or make fun of you or whatever, because that's what they want
[10:37] to do. And maybe I'm not, I'm not even going to get into the psychology of that. But like
[10:43] people will do that. And I've always been of the mind that the really interesting
[10:46] people out there are people who are unashamedly interested in stuff. And who are like,
[10:51] yeah, I'm nerding out about this and I'm sharing it because I'm interested in it. And
[10:54] for better for worse, like I love working in product. I love the job, even all the gross
[10:58] stuff you have to do. It's super interesting. You meet really cool people, you get to ship
[11:01] stuff, you get to see the stuff get used by people and solve problems. It's a really
[11:05] cool job. And I've always been interested in how to do it better. And it doesn't matter
[11:09] between that some people might think that's cringe, because like, that's cool. But this
[11:13] is what I do all day long. So like I'd like to get better at it.
[11:16] I think that's such such a big part of it. I didn't even mention that just think
[11:20] it needs to feel like really authentic and clearly for you is just like,
[11:24] there's just stuff I want to share because it's really interesting to me.
[11:27] Yeah, the way I actually started writing was exactly the two reasons you just shared. One is
[11:32] I wanted to learn the thing. And so writing helped me figure things out. And then two is I
[11:37] just thought it was interesting. And I found it useful. And I just assumed other people
[11:41] might find it useful. So I did also learn and I wonder if you found this too is that
[11:47] you think the things you know are not going to be that interesting or useful to people because
[11:51] they're so basic for you. But people are finding the most basic stuff so interesting.
[11:56] Because there's always like more to learn about how to roadmap, how to prioritize,
[11:59] how to hire, how to talk to have difficult conversations, performance review.
[12:04] All of that is absolutely true. And I think one of the first pieces of content that I
[12:11] was really happy with was like, I was working with somebody and they were making a PowerPoint
[12:17] presence in your slides or whatever. And I just wrote out in my notebook like, okay,
[12:21] here's how I do that. Like, right, I start with an outline on paper. And then I draw little boxes
[12:27] for the slides. And I write out the headline of the slides. And then once I have a tight
[12:32] outline and I have the literal text that will go across the top of each of those things,
[12:36] then I sketch out how I want the slides to go. And then I go into Google Docs and I actually
[12:40] make this slide. And it was like some silly little thing. And this person sat there and said,
[12:46] holy shit, you just totally changed the way I did this. And this took me 75% last time,
[12:52] then it would have taken me otherwise. And I was like, I may do this dumb drawing. Like,
[12:55] why is this a big deal? And yeah, that's when I realized that like the stuff that's easy for
[12:59] you might be the stuff that is most interesting because it's something that maybe you're
[13:01] really good at that you don't realize. I think people need to really internalize that
[13:06] point. Like if there's something that you're doing that you consistently
[13:09] find useful and works often that is going to be really useful for someone to hear.
[13:14] So that could be a good place to start.
