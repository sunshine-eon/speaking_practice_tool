============================================================

[00:00] Let's talk about the last part, which is the third point you made, which is carrying the
[00:04] water.
[00:05] I think is how you described it.
[00:06] Yeah.
[00:07] This one, there's no tips and tricks.
[00:10] It's just do the work.
[00:13] If you ever find yourself saying something like, that's not my job.
[00:18] That's probably a thing you should do.
[00:19] And you know what?
[00:20] It probably isn't your job.
[00:21] And it probably is someone else's job.
[00:23] And you can spend your life getting frustrated at that, or you can just get over and
[00:26] get the work done.
[00:28] And people who are willing to just get the work done, will move faster.
[00:31] Their products will be more successful.
[00:34] And they probably aren't carrying around all that anger and crappy emotion.
[00:40] Because we touched on this earlier as a PM for better or for worse.
[00:44] And maybe this is not how we all want it to be, but you're oftentimes the emotional
[00:48] center of the team.
[00:50] And it's your job to keep people motivated, keep people excited, keep them bought into
[00:54] the project.
[00:55] And you just have to keep that optimism going.
[00:59] And it's hard work.
[01:00] It's really hard work to stay positive and to keep people amped for that thing.
[01:06] And part of it can be just like, you know what?
[01:07] Let me take that on.
[01:09] Let me grab that whatever.
[01:11] I'll do this thing.
[01:13] I'll hop on the sales call.
[01:14] I'll implement this with the customer.
[01:16] You just have to do whatever it takes.
