Wow. Okay, cool. So let's get into what you've learned about building an amazing product team and also hiring an amazing product team. 

First of all, you call your product managers product owners. When we were chatting initially, I was like, oh, I see it's just like a big scrum business and they just have always product owners. Many times on this podcast, people have talked about how that's not actually a product manager, but that's not at all how you work. In this context, product owners are actual owners. Talk about the story behind why you call them product owners instead of product managers.

It's not a scrum term for us; it's just our take on emphasizing how ownership is important. Product owners are central to the company and its growth. They are end-to-end responsible for the product, for this part of the business, and for ensuring their customers are happy. For that, they do really everything. They run the teams, define which roadmap we need to build to improve certain business metrics, and contribute to high-level company strategy. Most importantly, they execute on it relentlessly and are ultimately responsible for the product being shipped and achieving results.

There's always this term of mini CEOs, and in your context, that seems to be what you try to do with your product team. They are essentially mini CEOs with a lot of power. I think engineers and designers report to them, is that right?

Yeah, correct. Well, I prefer to say local CEOs. But that's true. The way we operate, we have these fully cross-functional teams. They are staffed with all necessary functions: engineers, data analysts, designers, operation managers, and so on. We also operate in a metrics-driven environment. Everyone has a line manager and a functional manager. The product owner is always the line manager for everyone on the team, meaning the product owner defines what they need to do. Functional managers, on the other hand, define how these things need to be built, ensuring the right level of quality and so on.
