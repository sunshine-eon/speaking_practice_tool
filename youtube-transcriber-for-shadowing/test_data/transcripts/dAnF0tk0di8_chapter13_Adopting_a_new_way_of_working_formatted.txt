And companies form roots, and roots go in the ground. Once your root structure is formed, the plant that grows from that is essentially tied to those roots. To change, you almost have to uproot and plant a new seed somewhere else. It's very hard to change in flight and alter what you have and what you're used to. 

What we often encourage people to do is to keep working the way they currently are, but to try a new method on a future project that has low criticality. If it doesn't work, it's probably not going to work very well the first time. Just like if I gave you a guitar you've never played before, it would be unreasonable for me to expect you to play well right away. You're going to struggle for a while.

So, pick some things that don't matter if you struggle with them for a while and try this new method there. You might find that you're actually getting quite good at it, and then you can consider bringing this approach into more critical projects. This is an important way to approach these sorts of initiatives: by taking the criticality out of the equation.

What often happens is that when people try something new on a critical project and it doesn't work, they become discouraged and are unlikely to try it again. They feel as though they've destroyed all future opportunities to experiment because everyone remembers how poorly it went last time on something that really mattered. They might think, "We could have done it our old way; it may have been subpar, but it worked."

In this scenario, you're comparing two things that aren't really comparable. People will naturally lean towards the momentum of their previous methods rather than embracing the new approach. So, it's important to be cautious about this tendency. I know I'm rambling a bit, but that's my general sense and feel on how to adopt a different way of working.
