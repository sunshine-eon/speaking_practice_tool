============================================================

[00:00] Okay, talk about how this feature originally came to be.
[00:03] What was the original version of it?
[00:04] What was the original insight that led to be one?
[00:06] Yeah, so the oldest streaks are as old as Duolingo itself.
[00:10] We, when we launched Duolingo, we launched with the streak.
[00:14] And I say we, I was like just graduating undergrad
[00:16] when Duolingo launched.
[00:18] So this is well before my time.
[00:20] But we launched with a streak feature.
[00:23] The, you know, the initially how the,
[00:25] how the feature worked was you'd come to Duolingo
[00:28] and you'd set a goal for yourself.
[00:30] And it was an XP based goal.
[00:31] So Duolingo, a little bit of like, you know,
[00:33] nomenclature, we have a experience point and space system
[00:36] that drives a lot of our features in the app.
[00:38] And the way you'd set it is you'd say, you know,
[00:39] based on what your language learning goal was,
[00:42] you know, maybe you have a 10 experience point goal
[00:45] versus a 50 experience point goal.
[00:46] And so extending your streak would be,
[00:49] hey, can you hit 50 experience points
[00:51] if that's what you said your goal to be able.
[00:53] And this worked well.
[00:54] I think this also speaks to like
[00:55] how Duolingo initially grew.
[00:56] You know, we were,
[00:58] Luis launched it with a TED talk.
[01:00] You know, we probably had a more tech forward user base,
[01:02] you know, initially.
[01:03] And so this whole idea of like an experience point space
[01:06] streak system made sense.
[01:07] But what that also meant is that you could have a user
[01:09] come and use the app, do multiple lessons a day.
[01:12] Maybe they just set too hard of a goal for themselves
[01:15] and then lose their streak,
[01:16] which I don't, you know,
[01:18] you don't need to be an expert in streaks
[01:19] to understand that's probably not good.
[01:21] You know, the nice thing
[01:22] with how we initially set it up though
[01:23] is it really did connect with what your goal was.
[01:25] So if you were serious, let's track
[01:27] how good you are at being a serious language learner.
[01:30] But I'd say one of the most impactful experiments we ran
[01:33] was about, this is actually as I was joining,
[01:36] we had, or just after I joined,
[01:38] we had run this experiment,
[01:40] was to move it from a XP based streak
[01:43] to just do one lesson a day
[01:45] and you'd extend your streak.
[01:46] And you know, the risk that you can sort of imagine is,
[01:49] well then users kind of care less about it
[01:51] because it's not connected with their goal.
[01:53] And we saw none of that.
[01:54] I mean, this was huge driver of DAUs,
[01:57] just making it easier to extend your streak.
[02:00] But I think really importantly is still meaningful, right?
[02:02] Like the unit of use,
[02:04] and you know, as you're thinking about building a streak,
[02:06] like I think it's really important to think about
[02:08] like what the unit of use of your app is.
[02:11] The unit of use for Duolingo is like doing a lesson.
[02:13] And so if what we care about is users coming back
[02:16] every day and doing a lesson
[02:17] because it shows that they're actually engaging
[02:18] with the app, then it doesn't hurt us
[02:20] to make our streak focus on just do one unit
[02:23] versus multiple.
[02:25] And so that was like probably the big C change experiment
[02:27] that we ran, you know, at the time was moving
[02:30] from an XP based streak to a one lesson streak.
[02:32] It's also simple.
[02:33] And I think that's like one of the things
[02:35] to think about with streaks.
[02:36] It's always easy as a PM to like,
[02:38] you know, have a million goals or objectives
[02:40] for what you want your feature to be
[02:41] and potentially build a more complex feature.
[02:44] You know, one lesson streak,
[02:45] it's just easy for more users to understand.
[02:48] Yeah, that's exactly what I was gonna say.
[02:49] And just for folks that aren't super familiar with XP,
[02:51] it's basically experience points
[02:53] and you get them from like doing things.
[02:54] It's like, yeah, you do stuff on Duolingo
[02:57] and then based on what you did
[02:59] and how well you did it, we give you experience points.
[03:02] This actually drives a number of our features in our app.
[03:04] So leaderboards is the big one.
[03:06] You know, we have a leaderboard system
[03:07] where you try over the course of the week,
[03:09] you battle with 29 other people and you want to win.
[03:12] That's all driven by XP.
[03:13] So we do have other features in the app
[03:14] that really benefit from this XP system.
[03:18] The streak is just no longer one of them.
[03:20] Awesome.
[03:21] I want to talk about the journey from that point
[03:23] to what it is today, but a quick tangent.
[03:25] I saw Louise tweet just this week, someone asked him,
[03:28] how do you decide whether to optimize for learning
[03:31] or engagement?
[03:33] And he's like, no question.
[03:35] Everything we do is focused on engagement
[03:37] because you won't learn anything
[03:39] if you're not coming back to the app.
[03:41] As an engagement PM, that was like the coolest thing
[03:44] he could have ever tried.
[03:46] It's, well, again, very much as a subjectively,
[03:49] I guess, as an engagement PM.
[03:50] I mean, that's how I've, you know, I'm sure my learning,
[03:53] the learning folks at Duolingo cringe when they hear it.
[03:55] Like I see myself as a learning PM
[03:57] as much as an engagement PM because the easiest way
[04:00] not to learn on Duolingo is not to come back the next day.
[04:03] And so if we don't make the app retentive,
[04:06] you will have no opportunity to engage
[04:08] with our learning features.
[04:09] Now, I do think that there is a long tail of learning
[04:12] where if you start to dumb down,
[04:14] and honestly, this is something we wrestle
[04:16] with the streak as well,
[04:17] you start to dumb down the experience
[04:19] and your users aren't actually learning,
[04:20] they're not going to care.
[04:22] I mean, streaks work best when they're sitting on top
[04:24] of an app, you know, that users care about.
[04:28] But yeah, I mean, if you can't come, you know,
[04:31] if you don't come learn on Duolingo,
[04:33] you know, if you don't come back to Duolingo,
[04:34] then you're not learning.
[04:35] So now we, I mean, we track a lot of this with,
[04:38] you know, the work that we do,
[04:39] we make sure that as we're making changes
[04:41] to the streak, we're not hurting the learning experience
[04:44] and we don't have a ton of interaction with it.
[04:46] So we're constantly thinking about this,
[04:47] but thank you, Louise, for saying that.
[04:50] It makes sense to me.
