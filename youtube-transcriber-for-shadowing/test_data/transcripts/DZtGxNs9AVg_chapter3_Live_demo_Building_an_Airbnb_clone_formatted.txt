============================================================

So we're going to come back to some of this stuff, but let's get into a demo. I rarely do demos on this podcast, but I'm finding that it's really important for people to see these products in action. This is, in large part, the future of product building. A lot of people hear about new tools and technologies, but I don't think many actually see what the latest tools are capable of. So I love showing these sorts of things on this podcast.

Lenny, I was thinking, did you ever consider making a copy and building your own Airbnb? 

I haven't. But go on. 

How about you do that? Let's do it. 

Okay, so we're going to make our own Airbnb. I just put in the first prompt for an Airbnb clone. And for folks that aren't watching, the prompt was just two words: "Airbnb clone." The AI responds by outlining what a beautiful Airbnb clone would look like, going through various design decisions. 

Now, if I zoom out, we have this UI that has all the nice features you'd expect from an Airbnb clone, including different categories and two listings with login buttons. So far, it doesn't have the functionality of Airbnb; it just has the UI. I would now ask for an improvement on some of the functionality. For instance, if I'm switching categories, I want to see different listings. If you have any thoughts on what we should build next, let me know.

You have this preloaded, so you don't see how long it would take, but how long would this normally take for it to just write all this code and have it ready for you? 

The first prompt takes about 30 seconds. 

30 seconds. Okay. And it's a very good copy of Airbnb. I love that you didn't have to show it a design; you just tell it "Airbnb," and it knows what to do. 

So your question is what I want to add to my own version of Airbnb. I've always wanted to explore buying the place that I look at, just to see if it's for sale. What if we see what that would feel like if there was a way to buy a listing? 

Let's add a button on the listing that says "Purchase this Airbnb home." 

Perfect. And I'll be even more specific: it will pop up a modal to purchase the listing. 

Great. As you're typing, I want to share some thoughts. The site that you asked this AI engineer to build is actually a functioning website that you can browse around. It's not just a design. 

Say you were trying to actually build Airbnb and wanted to start adding actual homes that plug into this. How does that step work? 

As you said, this is just a mock-up UI, but it's also interactive. If I want to add login and listing management, then we will connect something called the backend, where data is stored and user information is managed. I can show you how to do that. 

First, let's try out what we've got with this short prompt of adding the purchase listing. It didn't do exactly what I wanted; I said to add a button, but I didn't specify what the button should say. It says "Book Now," and if I click it, I get a booking confirmation. The AI probably assumed you wanted to book the listing since it's Airbnb, right? 

So it still says "Book the listing," but it shows a modal where I can click "Confirm" and pay. Then it says, "Booking confirmed." 

I'll just say real quick, I love that this is a great example of why being a good product manager is important. A lot of wasted time happens when you're not clear about the problem you're trying to solve and why you're trying to solve it. This use case highlights the need to be very clear about what you want. 

It's interesting; you don't have to tell this AI why it's important. Humans often want to understand the "why," but with AI, you mostly need to be clear about what you're doing. That's a really strong PM skill. PMs are really good at that. 

So we have to explain exactly what you expect and what you're not getting. It's even more important with AI than with humans. But first, I'll show you the fastest way to change what went wrong. 

It created buttons that say "Book Now," and I want them to say "Buy Now." I could select this item and change it to "Buy Now," but what we just released is that you can actually edit this visually, like you're using Squarespace or Wix. 

So I'll just change the text to "Buy Now," and it instantly updates. It changes deep down in the code base, but it's very fast to do that. 

For those listening, if you're not aware, this is the cutting edge of tools like this. No other tool out there lets you generate code from an AI engineer and then actually change a small element of it. With other tools, you have to ask the agent to do something for you, and then you hope it does the right thing. This is a huge deal, which you just demonstrated, right? 

Yeah. Now it says "Buy Now." 

And that's something you just launched. 

Correct. We just launched this a few days ago. 

I want to go into fulfilling the full functionality. What it looks like is that you connect an open-source backend as a service called Superbase. I have this instance to connect to that's completely empty, and it's just one click to set that up. Now it's connected to the backend, and it's automatically generating and explaining some code and what I can do next. 

What I would do now is say, "Let's add login." Where is it actually hosted on the backend? 

Everything can be one-click deployed, and then it's running and hosted by a cloud vendor, which hosts a huge chunk of the internet called Cloudflare. The backend is hosted by another good cloud provider called Superbase. 

Amazing. Okay, let's wrap up the demo. Was there anything else really important you wanted to show? 

I would explain what I would do next. I would say, "Okay, let's add login. Let's make the listings editable by users so they can upload listings." This is going to take a bit more time, but with patience and good prompting skills, you're going to get to a fully working Airbnb. 

That was a really good piece to add. Essentially, this is getting to a place where it actually is not so different from actual Airbnb. People can log in, they can add their homes, and you can add internal tools for your sales or ops team. Basically, it will allow you to build a marketplace that looks a lot like Airbnb. 

Great. That looks a lot like Airbnb. Amazing. 

Thank you for the demo. For a lot of people, they're like, "Yeah, I've seen this kind of stuff," but for most people, it's like, "Holy shit, it's unreal!" It's almost like we're taking for granted now that you can ask an app to build you a whole website. 

That probably costs just a few pennies and takes about five minutes, whereas it would have been tens of thousands and weeks or even months to build just a prototype. These tools, as we see here, are already very good. They look really good as well, but mainly, they're getting better very, very fast.
