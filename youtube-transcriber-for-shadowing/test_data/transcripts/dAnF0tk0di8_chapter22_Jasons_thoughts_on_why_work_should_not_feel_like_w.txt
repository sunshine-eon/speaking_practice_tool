[00:00] You mentioned the principles of the company, and I was going to touch on one of these actually,
[00:03] and what's the URL to check these out? By the way, we'll link to it in the show notes.
[00:06] Yeah, 37signals.com.
[00:08] Okay, right. Just the homepage.
[00:09] Yeah, yeah. The homepage, yeah.
[00:10] Okay. So one of them is work isn't war. And you wrote a book about this,
[00:15] roughly, about work doesn't have to suck. But I guess just, can you just talk about
[00:18] why work feels like war, and then what maybe people could do to make it feel less like war?
[00:24] This is about words in a lot of ways. So I don't, I'm not looking at the page right
[00:28] now. I could pull it up and read it. But essentially, a lot of work uses war metaphors
[00:34] and war to like, you're targeting customers. You are conquering a market. Gosh, now I really
[00:42] want to make sure I get all these right. So hang on, I'm just going to look this up because
[00:46] these things are how people talk about work. So it says they conquer the market,
[00:53] they capture mind share, they target customers, they employ a sales force,
[00:58] they hire head hunters, they destroy the competition, they pick battles and they make a killing.
[01:04] That's how people talk about business. I find that to be depressing.
[01:09] It just feels depressing to me. We use words to establish a perspective in a way of thinking
[01:17] about the world. And if those are the words that are in your head, then you feel like it's
[01:21] this war. And we're always like, people are always, this is the other thing that people
[01:25] are always like, what do the Navy SEALs do? And they're like, yeah, that's the Navy SEALs, man.
[01:30] It's not your software business. We always look into Navy SEALs and tell us how to run a business.
[01:35] And military, they've got a group of eight and they do, yeah, okay. That's that context.
[01:40] Can we not look at that for a second? That's amazing. What they do is amazing,
[01:45] obviously. But what you're doing is you're making B2B accounting software.
[01:48] Let's just chill for a second here. And so I like to think of words that are more
[01:53] additive and alternative. And we can exist. Let's exist. Let's make something great.
[02:00] Not like let's beat them. Let's conquer them. Let's make a killing. Let's just make something great.
[02:07] I think that matters. And it changes the way you think about the work that you do.
[02:11] It's more about pride and excitement and a spirit of creation than it is destruction.
[02:19] I think if you go into it with destruction in mind, you're going to end up in a pretty dark place.
[02:24] So that's our point of view.
