============================================================

[00:00] I love that this is an example of how you can build a company the way that you want to build it
[00:04] You don't have to do it the way everybody else has done
[00:06] I imagine there's a lot of challenges to this too, but I think it's inspiring to just like hey
[00:10] I'm gonna design a company the way I want to build it. Yeah, it's amazing what you can
[00:15] Get away with in terms of shaping the new universe here liking. I think people automatically assume
[00:20] That things have to go a certain way, especially founders and first-time founders. It's like
[00:26] You should at least like try it. It's like, okay
[00:28] Well, you know, I want to do it. Well, first of all, I'll give you another kind of tactical example both my co-founder
[00:32] I are night people not morning people. That's just happens
[00:36] You know, I didn't pick him because of that. We didn't learn that later
[00:40] And so we made it just like from the early days of upspot in the early years at least we're like
[00:45] No meetings before 11 a.m
[00:48] There you like that's that was it and then we adjusted it
[00:51] I think maybe three or four years and we're like, all right
[00:53] We can have meetings before 11 a.m. You just can't invite one of the co-founders to it
[00:57] So you're welcome to meet amongst yourselves if you choose to do so. But anyway, it's yeah, it's a little things
[01:04] That's an amazing rule
[01:05] I have a personal rule where I've no meetings before 3 p.m. Because I don't work anywhere
[01:09] I can come more so create my schedule
[01:11] But the idea is I create this deep work time in the beginnings of the day. I love that. Yeah
