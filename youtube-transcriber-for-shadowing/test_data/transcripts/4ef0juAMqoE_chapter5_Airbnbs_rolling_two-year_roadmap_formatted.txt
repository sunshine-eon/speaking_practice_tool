============================================================

Now what we do is we have a rolling two-year roadmap. We don't even really do an annual plan. I mean, as you remember, Lanny, near Airbnb, we would have like three-month planning cycles. Now, the planning cycle is just a budgeting cycle, and it's like most people only spend a week or two on it. Some don't spend any time on it at all. 

We have a rolling two-year product strategy roadmap that gets updated every six months with releases. We release products every May and every November or October. Obviously, we did one today that we can talk about. The entire company works together; they row in the same direction. The product management also does product marketing, so they're figuring out how people are going to learn about it. They're doing the demos, understanding the story, creating the videos, and figuring out all the customer touchpoints to ensure everyone understands it. 

Our product marketing works with communications. We work months ahead of time on all the different assets. When we're working on a launch, one of the first things we'll do is start figuring out what the story is. The story will often dictate the product because ultimately, you have to tell the story to people. A story is also a really helpful way to develop a cohesive product. 

We wanted a company where 1,000 people could work, but it looked like 10 people did it. Sorry, that was a bit of a brain dump, but that is a little bit of a universal theory for how we develop products now. I mean, I could go into a lot more detail, but I probably will stop there. 

That was amazing. You touched on all of the things I want to talk about, so I'm gonna... Oh, gee, we can go deeper and deeper because the rabbit hole goes deeper. 

Yeah, exactly.
