============================================================

With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready? Let's do it. 

What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people? The first one is this book here: "Several Short Sentences About Writing." Do you know this book? I love that book. I have it on my coffee table. When anyone ever asks me what book I recommend on writing, it's this one. "Several Short Sentences About Writing." I can never pronounce his last name, but Verne Klinkenborg, I believe, is his name, although I might be bastardizing that. It's an extraordinarily good book about writing, and it's all about the sentence. Beautifully written, fun to read, really great. 

The other one is pretty much anything by Derek Sivers, but specifically "Hell Yeah or No." This book is something I recommend to everybody. It's really had a big effect on me and David specifically. We use this term "Hell Yeah or No" all the time internally. Is this a Hell Yeah or No? It really clarifies a lot of things. 

The last one is this design book, which is interesting. There are a few different versions of it. The one I have handy is called "Homemade Contemporary Russian Folk Artifacts." What this book is, it's a collection of beautiful stories. Basically, every spread is a person, a story, and a thing that they had to make because they didn't have anything. They couldn't get what they needed. 

For example, there's a guy who put a hole in a spoon to make bubbles for his kid. This is a TV antenna made out of forks. It gets back to the scrappiness. I admire this kind of ingenuity over pretty much anything. This book is full of amazing examples. Look at this one: this guy had to make a door handle. In America, we're like, go get a door handle at Home Depot. This guy didn't have a door handle, so he made it out of a plastic gallon container and nailed it to a book, which he then nailed to a door. Amazing. 

I've always loved looking at jailhouse creations and tools, how people make weapons out of combs and pens. I find this fascinating—having nothing and needing something, using your human brain to figure out how to make it. I think that scrappiness is beautiful. 

Yeah, I was just going to say it speaks clearly to your scrappy mentality. And what is that book called again? 

This one's called "Homemade Contemporary Russian Folk Artifacts." There’s also an Eastern European version and another one too, but Homemade. What an awesome, unusual selection. 

Okay, next question. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show? 

I don't watch TV. I rarely get a chance to see movies these days. I really thoroughly enjoyed "Oppenheimer," though. That was one of the movies I went to the theater to see, and it was really special. I just loved the movie. It's fantastic. 

Do you have a favorite interview question that you'd like to ask candidates that you are interviewing to hire? 

Yeah, I think we kind of actually went over this one a little bit. I'm always curious about what else, if you had more time, what would you do with this idea? Another one is, whose work do you admire? It's not so much about what you can do, but what are other people doing that you think is great? I find that really illuminates what kind of pulse they have on the world, what they're looking at, what inspires them, and what they think is good. So I like that question. 

In that second question, what do you look for? Is it like someone that you also admire? 

Ultimately, in the moment, I don't care who it is. It's more about, tell me why. If someone says they like so-and-so, I want to know why they like them. What are they doing that you think is interesting? This is kind of the thing I tend to always ask: why do you think that’s interesting? I'm always trying to get behind the words and understand where this is coming from. People can prepare answers and sound great, but it's about what's behind that. Where are you going with that? Why? What's the genesis of this? That's sort of what I'm always after. 

Is there a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love? 

Yes, although it's more of a category. I recently bought an old car and I've fallen back in love with stick shifts. I learned how to drive stick and then I basically had automatic cars for many years. Now, I’m back into the old analog driving experience and how wonderful it is to feel attached to the machine that you're using. 

That you turn the wheel and it turns a rod, which turns the wheels. Your leg muscle actually is what is braking the car to some degree. There’s something about that direct feel that really surprised me. It reminded me of our business. I think we have a very stick shift business. Everything's very tight, very straightforward. There are not a lot of layers of abstraction. 

In contrast, I think of large businesses as like automatic transmissions, where everything's simulated. You don’t really know what the road feels like. You can't feel it in the steering wheel. The brakes are just sending a command to a computer to squeeze the pads. The transmission does its own thing. There’s a beauty in that too, but there's also a disconnect that I forgot about until I got back into driving the old car, which is harder to drive, noisier, bumpier, and creakier. But there's a real directness to it that's special. Staying as connected to the thing that you're doing as possible has a lot of value. 

That's an awesome metaphor. 

Next question. Do you have a favorite life model that you often repeat to yourself, share with folks, or find useful in work or in life? 

Yeah. I don’t always live up to it, but basically it's worry less. There's a great Tom Petty lyric—most of the things you worry about never happen anyway. It's just so true. I find myself worrying about all sorts of things that don’t matter and never happen. Then I think, God, I spent like three days worrying about that, or I went to this appointment and it was fine. 

The amount of worry is all in your head, anticipating the future that hasn't happened yet. I try to tell myself that and I try to tell others that in business. Like, what if people don’t like it? I don’t know, you’ll find out. Worry less about it. It probably isn’t going to be a big deal anyway. So that's kind of what I would say: worry less. 

Final question. I was going to ask you this before you mentioned it, but you said you're writing a new book potentially. Are you able to share with us what the new book might be about? 

Yeah, we haven't started writing it. I can tell you I'm thinking about it. It's going to revolve around the idea of gut and intuition in business and decision-making. I don't really know exactly how they all play in here in a book, but I think we need to celebrate gut and intuition more in business. Most business books are not about that; they're kind of about the opposite in many ways. 

You can't improve what you can't measure or whatever these things are. I think that's true in a lot of realms like medicine, where you can look at your biomarkers. I don’t think things are quite as direct in business. Intuition and gut are something to be celebrated. 

I think what we're probably going to end up doing is looking at all the ways we use intuition and gut to make decisions at work, whether it's hiring, product decisions, or policy decisions. We might break down some of those decisions in the past or talk about things on a day-to-day basis about how we employ those tools to move forward. That's roughly the idea. It's very loose right now, but hopefully we can tighten it up. 

That's an awesome topic for a book. I was thinking "Worry Less" could also be an awesome title for a book if that's another topic. 

That'd be a great title for a book to go down. 

Yeah, that would be. Also, I was just reading Charlie Munger's "Poor Charlie's Almanack" right now. There's a whole section around psychology and the way we misjudge and make mistakes with our psychology—human misjudgment. 

Yeah, exactly. I feel like that would be a part of this story: gut instincts are often right, but here are ways that we are often wrong. So maybe that's something to think about. 

It's funny; I had one opportunity to meet with Charlie Munger. It was on a Zoom call with four of us, and we got an hour with him a few years ago. I only asked him one question. I was mostly just a student, listening to other people's questions. I asked, what's your take on doing something well that you know nothing about? Essentially, is there power in being completely ignorant about something? 

I've often found myself more creative when I don't know how to do something versus thinking, well, this is how you're supposed to do it. I really loved his answer, which was to trust your instinct on that. A lot of great things happen because you don’t know how to do them. In fact, a lot of innovations happen because you don’t know how other people do them. All you have is your gut, your intuition, and how you feel about the thing. 

You don’t have evidence, other examples to follow, or a list of what to do. You just kind of do. I’m paraphrasing here, but it gave me a lot of confidence and hope to continue to follow our gut. Maybe this is ultimately what was the seed for this book, although I hadn’t really thought about that until now. It’s a beautiful thing to read and to listen to him speak. 

I love it. Jason, we covered everything I was hoping we'd cover. Thank you so much for making the time for this. 

Two final questions. Folks who want to follow up and maybe ask more questions, how can they reach you? And then how can listeners be useful to you?
