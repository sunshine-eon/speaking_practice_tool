============================================================

Awesome. Okay. Let's talk about product market fit. I know that everyone, when they think of Rahul, they think product market fit. You wrote this epic First Round post that describes the way you guys approach product market fit. We're not going to spend a lot of time on describing it because people can look it up. So let me just ask you this: what are a couple of things that you think people still don't understand about finding product market fit and getting to product market fit? Considering it's the most important thing you’ve got to figure out as a founder, right? If you don't find something people want, nothing else matters. Anything there you want to share?

The core ideas are still weird enough that I'll start there, which is number one: you can measure product market fit. Number two: you can optimize product market fit. Number three: you can systematically, even numerically, increase product market fit. And number four: you can even have an algorithm write your roadmap for you, and that is a roadmap that is guaranteed to increase product market fit. Now, if that sounds crazy, I would be the first to admit it doesn’t seem like that should be true. But go check out that post. I think it is still the most widely shared post on First Round Review. It's called "How Superhuman Built an Engine to Find Product Market Fit," or just Google the Superhuman product market fit engine, and you'll see the algorithm laid out there, fully explained, and why it works.

The second thing is that to get to product market fit, you have to deliberately not act on the feedback of many of your early users. This is at the same time as listening to people intensely and building what people want. Right? That's what we're here to do: to make something that people want. But it can't be all people; it can't be everybody. The question becomes: how do you listen to them, and then even of what they say, what do you pay attention to and what don’t you? All of that’s covered in the product market fit engine.

Okay, I got to follow this thought on algorithmically building a roadmap to increase product market fit. How would one do that? Well, I mean, that’s really the meat of the engine. So let's see if I can condense it here in a very easy-to-grok fashion. Let's assume for the sake of argument that you can put a number on product market fit, and it turns out you can. Very simply, you're going to ask people: "How would you feel if you can no longer use this product?" You give them three responses: one of them is "very disappointed," the other is "somewhat disappointed," and the last is "not disappointed." Very disappointed means, "I'd be devastated; I love this product," or "I need this product." 

What Sean Ellis found—Sean Ellis, if you don't know him, is the guy who coined the term "growth hacker"—is that he instrumented and benchmarked this initial question. What he found is that the companies that struggled to grow almost always had less than 40 percent very disappointed, whereas the companies that grew the fastest almost always had more than 40 percent very disappointed. This question, this metric, is way more predictive of success than something like net promoter score.

Okay, so far so easy. How do we make this number go up? Well, you want more people to be very disappointed without your product. The trick here is not to act too much on the feedback that the very disappointed people are giving you because they already love your product. Also, not to act at all really on the feedback that the not disappointed people are giving you because they’re so far from loving your product that they are essentially a lost cause. But to focus on the segment of the somewhat disappointed people. They kind of love your product, but something—and I would wager something small—is holding them back.

So you then divide them into two camps: the camp for whom the main benefit of your product resonates and the camp for whom it doesn't. What do I mean by that? Well, you go back to the people who really love your product and you basically ask them, "Why? What is it about my product that you really love?" In the early days of Superhuman, it would have been speed and keyboard shortcuts, the overall design aesthetic, as well as the time that we were saving you. 

Then you go back to the somewhat disappointed users, and in the Superhuman example, I would simply ask, "Wait, do you like Superhuman because of its speed or for something else?" If it's something else, well, and this is hard to do, but politely disregard those people and their feedback because even if you built everything that they asked for, they’re still pulling you in a different direction. The thing that they like the most from your product isn't actually what the people who love it the most love it for. 

So you have then articulated the sub-segment of the sub-segment that it makes sense to pay attention to. There’s another question in the engine to figure out what they don’t like about the product. Now you have a list of things people love and a list of things people don’t love, and you can work down that list to make the product market fit score go up. Basically, at the start of every planning cycle, I advise spending half your time doubling down on what people really love and half your time systematically overcoming the objections of the somewhat disappointed users, but specifically those for whom the main benefit resonates.

That was an excellent summary. I know I said we wouldn't spend a ton of time here, but I'm really glad we did. That was really helpful. Let me ask you this: I know you used this initially in the early days. Are you still operating in this way in some form?

We don't run the engine as is for Superhuman as a whole. There are enough subcomponents of Superhuman now that are almost individual products. For example, Superhuman for sales, our multiplayer and collaboration features. How we think about the enterprise AI is its whole thing. But we do sometimes run it on those individual pieces. For example, we'll ask a salesperson the product market fit engine as it relates to Superhuman for sales. And as we think about starting new products, we would absolutely deploy the product market fit engine.

Awesome. And the way you ask this question is an in-product interstitial sort of survey pop-up thing. You can do it however you want. The way Sean initially benchmarked the number was via email surveys. I think email surveys work just fine. The key thing is—and this applies to any survey methodology—if you're going to change the method of surveying, all of your old numbers are invalidated. So it's just a new baseline going forward.

Got it. And we had Sean on the podcast, and he describes this method in detail. So if folks want to explore this, listen to that podcast.
