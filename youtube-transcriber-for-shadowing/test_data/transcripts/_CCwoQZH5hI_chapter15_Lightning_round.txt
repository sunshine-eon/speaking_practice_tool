Chapter 15: Lightning round
Video: Behind the product: Duolingo streaks | Jackson Shuttleworth (Group PM, Retention Team)
Time: 81:00 - 88:32
============================================================

[00:00] With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.
[00:03] Are you ready?
[00:04] I'm ready.
[00:06] First question.
[00:07] What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?
[00:10] All right.
[00:11] I'll start with a guide to Midwest Conversation.
[00:14] So I'm based in Kansas City.
[00:15] I'm a proud Midwesterner.
[00:17] And us Midwesterners talk in a certain way.
[00:20] I think, you know, you hear about Minnesota nice, but we tend not to say what we
[00:24] mean.
[00:25] And it is a very funny primer into what Midwesterners actually mean when they say
[00:30] what they say.
[00:31] So I highly recommend reading that.
[00:33] I like that they give that to people just like, here's what I might be telling you,
[00:36] which you may not read.
[00:39] My wife is German and I gave it to her.
[00:40] I can see German being the opposite of that.
[00:43] Very different.
[00:46] Another book.
[00:47] This is a good one.
[00:48] Fate is the Hunters.
[00:49] This is a really cool book.
[00:50] It's a memoir of one of the early commercial airline pilots.
[00:55] And it is wild to hear the stories about what flying was back in the day.
[01:00] You know, I'm a former management consultant.
[01:02] I flew every week for almost six years and I never once had to worry about, am I going
[01:07] to make it to the other end of this flight alive?
[01:10] That was not the case back then.
[01:11] And so some of the stories about what it used to be like to be a pilot on some
[01:15] of these planes before modern aviation technology is fascinating and makes you
[01:19] really appreciate what we have.
[01:22] It feels good to read a book like that being a software, PM, or engineer,
[01:26] whatever, like how different that life is.
[01:28] Hardware is hard.
[01:31] It's not haptic design.
[01:33] OK, next, unless there's any other books you're going to share.
[01:36] OK, great.
[01:36] What's a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?
[01:40] So I have two kids.
[01:41] I watch a lot of Bluey.
[01:43] It's really good.
[01:44] I swear it brings me no shortage of joy.
[01:47] But adult show that I heard show not meant for four year olds that I have watched.
[01:52] I just finished the latest season of Emily in Paris.
[01:55] Man, wonderful.
[01:57] I realize it's not the highest brow of television, but just like beautiful
[02:01] people in beautiful cities solving problems that are not, you know,
[02:04] earth shattering.
[02:05] Sometimes it is nice to just tune out.
[02:07] Also, I'm learning French on Duolingo, a slight plug for the app.
[02:12] I can understand a lot of the French that is being spoken.
[02:15] And there is no better joy than having invested as much time as I have in French
[02:19] and actually being able to use it.
[02:21] So huge fan of Emily.
[02:23] That is so funny.
[02:23] What a fun of a diagram of interests.
[02:26] My mother-in-law loves Emily in Paris.
[02:29] I saw someone tweeting about like, what these are she on?
[02:31] How is she still in Paris?
[02:33] Yeah, you best just not ask questions.
[02:35] There's a lot of questions for this show that are better left unasked.
[02:39] Do you have a favorite product you recently discovered?
[02:41] Did that you really like other than Duolingo?
[02:43] Last week I went to Home Depot and I bought a new ladder and ladder innovations
[02:48] you don't think, you know, of often, but you can make one of the legs go a little
[02:53] bit further than the other leg.
[02:55] And as somebody like myself who has a house that is built on a slight slope,
[02:59] every time I go up on my ladder, I take my life in my hands.
[03:02] But with this ladder, I'm always even I clean my gutters twice last week
[03:06] just because of how awesome this ladder has how much this ladder has changed
[03:11] my life. So ladder innovation.
[03:13] I don't think it gets talked enough about.
[03:15] And so I'm happy to give it the spotlight it deserves.
[03:17] I appreciate you doing that.
[03:18] And it's the first ladder recommendation we've had on the podcast.
[03:21] Two more questions.
[03:22] Do you have a favorite life motto that you really find useful in worker
[03:24] and life that you share with folks?
[03:26] This probably will not be much of a surprise based on how I've talked
[03:29] about our willingness to test things, but you miss 100% of the shots
[03:33] that you don't take of a big fan of just trying things.
[03:36] Even if your possibility of success is not 100 because you learn a
[03:41] lot along the way.
[03:43] So final question.
[03:46] Do you have any fun traditions at Duolingo amongst either the PM team
[03:50] or the company in general that might be delightful to share?
[03:52] We have way too many traditions to count.
[03:57] I will share the weird tradition that we do at every retention stand up.
[04:01] And this started during the pandemic.
[04:04] You know, we obviously used to stand up in person.
[04:06] And then when we went remote, we did this thing where whoever's
[04:10] the last person to go would count down three, two, one.
[04:14] And then we'd all try to clap at the same time, which was kind of fun
[04:17] and dorky, but we fell in love with it.
[04:19] And four years later, we're still doing it.
[04:21] Recently we've added, we all say yee-haw in unison afterwards.
[04:28] I can't tell you why, but trying to synchronize a clap via Zoom
[04:33] and then all shouting yee-haw.
[04:35] I did this in a phone booth the other day and after I came out,
[04:38] someone told me, you know that those aren't as soundproof as you think,
[04:42] but you know, when you get a good opportunity to give a yee-haw,
[04:45] you kind of can't pass up on it.
[04:46] So I love these little things like they're so, you know, they sound
[04:49] so minor, but they're such important elements of team culture and tradition
[04:53] and so important for PMs to find ways to just have fun and do something ridiculous.
[04:58] I will say it took a while to get people behind shouting yee-haw.
[05:03] But now that we have people doing it, you can't, you can't take it away from it.
[05:08] We all love it.
[05:08] Oh, man. I called our all hands for a while.
[05:11] Y'all hands. Feel free to steal that.
[05:13] You get it. You get it, Lenny. Yeah, I get it.
[05:16] Jackson, this is incredible.
[05:17] I feel like people are going to listen to this with notebooks
[05:20] and just like, OK, here's a bunch of ideas we should try with whatever
[05:23] we're working on, whether it's streaks or not.
[05:25] Thank you so much for being here.
[05:26] Two final questions.
[05:28] Working folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more,
[05:30] learn more about Duolingo.
[05:31] I know you're hiring product managers, so share more there.
[05:34] And finally, how can listeners be useful to you?
[05:37] Yes, you can find me on LinkedIn.
[05:40] That is where most of my online social media is, so Jackson, Shuttleworth.
[05:44] And then how people can be useful to me.
[05:46] Yes, as you said, we are hiring.
[05:48] We're actually hiring for my team.
[05:50] Are you interested in thinking about streaks as much as we do?
[05:54] You know, we might be the right home for you.
[05:56] So please, you know, you can find our website.
[05:59] We're also hiring for a number of other product management roles
[06:02] and they are all as thrilling as this work is.
[06:05] And then, you know, I'm always interested about how other companies
[06:10] have implemented streaks and what they've learned.
[06:12] And so what I'd say is if you're a company who's implemented a streak,
[06:16] maybe in a different way than Duolingo has, or, you know,
[06:19] you found a whole ton of success and, you know, another vector,
[06:22] another element to the feature that we didn't talk about today.
[06:25] I would love to know more.
[06:27] I used to catalog basically every streak
[06:28] I found out there, and as it's become more of a popular feature,
[06:33] it's just been hard to keep up on.
[06:34] So, you know, if you have interesting streak insights to send my way,
[06:39] I would love to hear them.
[06:41] I love that collection of all the best ways of doing streaks.
[06:44] Jackson, I just want to say congrats to your team
[06:46] and you for having so much impact.
[06:49] This is like the dream of a lot of PMs and teams
[06:51] is to see this much impact and continue to ship wins.
[06:55] And so congrats. Nice work.
[06:57] Thank you very much.
[06:58] Keep your attention.
[06:59] And with that, Jackson, thanks so much for being here.
[07:01] Yeah, thank you, Lenny. This was a lot of fun.
[07:04] Same. Bye, everyone.
