============================================================

[00:00] So a couple of things I'm hearing here.
[00:02] One is the importance of focusing on not people
[00:06] currently using your product,
[00:07] but this idea of maybe the marginal user
[00:09] or the adjacent user,
[00:11] like the next state of users is who you should be
[00:13] thinking about when you're trying to optimize
[00:16] onboarding the user experience.
[00:18] And then two is something it sounds like
[00:20] you've had a lot of success with is
[00:21] picking one value prop, maybe one positioning statement,
[00:25] and then following that through their entire journey
[00:28] versus like here's all the things we do.
[00:30] Is that right?
[00:31] That's absolutely right.
[00:32] Let me give an example of this one.
[00:34] Like, and one of the reasons why I really feel
[00:37] product managers must, if not better,
[00:40] but equally understand category consumers,
[00:44] which are not in market or which are not really looking
[00:47] or which are not buying your products just yet,
[00:49] as good as the marketer or the brand expert
[00:53] in your team does, because they really are tasked with
[00:57] what is that one message that I can say
[00:59] that will make the user take attention
[01:02] or get to like all this interesting
[01:05] and direct attention towards your product.
[01:08] And if the product managers are able to do that,
[01:10] then they will choose that positioning
[01:12] and essentially understand what is my hope product
[01:14] and what is the hope that will at least get them
[01:17] to try my app or any of those things, right?
[01:22] So if they understand it as well as a marketer
[01:25] and then understand over a period of time,
[01:29] what is the right time when I introduce them
[01:31] to this other one rather than being very greedy
[01:34] about like letting the user try everything.
[01:37] So that's one.
[01:38] The other thing that I feel is a lot of product managers
[01:40] don't do right is forget about everything.
[01:43] Here's my app go figure is how most of the products
[01:48] are designed, unfortunately.
[01:49] That automatically these things will happen
[01:52] without any intervention.
[01:53] I have created something which is so beautiful.
[01:55] And once you tap that icon,
[01:57] everything inside that is my product
[01:58] that is so working perfectly.
[02:01] But they don't really think about at what moment
[02:03] do I actually get this user here and why will they use it?
[02:07] Well, this user is lazy, vain and selfish.
[02:10] That phrase reminds me of something I always think about
[02:12] with Mark Andreessen had this great quote
[02:14] that your user's time is already allocated.
[02:16] They're not like looking for more apps to download.
[02:19] They already have a plan for the day basically.
[02:21] They have things to do.
[02:22] They're not like, oh, it's another iPhone app.
[02:24] I'm gonna check out right now.
[02:26] And so somehow you have to convince them
[02:27] this is worth your time.
[02:28] And I like this framework.
