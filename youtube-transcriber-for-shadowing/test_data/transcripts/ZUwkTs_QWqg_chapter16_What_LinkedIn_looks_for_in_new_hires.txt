============================================================

[39:49] that you can get a decision very quickly.
[39:51] Are there any other really common frameworks
[39:53] or processes along these lines at LinkedIn
[39:55] that you find really helpful?
[39:56] The third thing is just in how we think about talent,
[40:00] especially in the product organization.
[40:02] And I often really do try to suss out during interviews
[40:06] or how we prevent people
[40:07] with just their ability to see systems.
[40:09] Because I do think it's again,
[40:11] I do think it's a different skill set
[40:12] and a different capability
[40:13] of how we kind of map those things out in a complexing group.
[40:16] And so oftentimes I think those talent systems will,
[40:20] those who are able to see the whole
[40:22] and make decisions out the whole,
[40:23] that's kind of rare actually.
[40:24] I think most talent systems are,
[40:25] hey, how did your division grow, your product grow,
[40:28] your error grow?
[40:29] And we've tried our best to understand
[40:31] if it's not just about that.
[40:33] I mean, you want accountability in the ecosystem, of course,
[40:35] but how well does this person work across?
[40:38] And I think it's kind of,
[40:39] we've created telemetry around that
[40:41] or organizational understanding of that,
[40:43] how we've understood ourselves kind of just,
[40:46] hey, this is the skill set that's really important here.
[40:48] I think that's quite rare
[40:49] in driving that kind of complex system as well.
