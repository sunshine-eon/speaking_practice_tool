============================================================

That's a really cool idea of just using the PRFAQ and working backwards process to think very differently. This approach helps ensure that you've explored all the options and allows you to think through things that might be in the back of people's minds. It encourages you to see if there's something there before committing to one direction. 

The FAQs are also very important for setting processes in the system. For example, if we are now Jupiter, a financial services app, every FAQ will need to address how we are going to ensure full compliance. Questions like, "Have you gotten sign-off from ABC people?" and "Have you actually thought about the legal aspects?" become mandatory. 

Take Swiggy as another example; it's a three-way marketplace involving consumers, delivery executives, and restaurant partners. Any small change you make regarding delivery partners, such as optimizing their earnings per hour, can lead to changes in the cost per delivery. This, in turn, may have a completely different impact on the delivery fee. Because of the many moving parts, your FAQs should explicitly ask, "Have you thought about the implications for restaurant partners?" and "What are the implications for delivery partners?" 

We used to have a specific FAQ that outlined the different segments of delivery partners. Sometimes, we would discover extremely odd correlations because product managers on one side of the equation began consulting the other part of the marketplace. This collaboration helps everyone come together to create very crisp products that work for all sides of the marketplace.
