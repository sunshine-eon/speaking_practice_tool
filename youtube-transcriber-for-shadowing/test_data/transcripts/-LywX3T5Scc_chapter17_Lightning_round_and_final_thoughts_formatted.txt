============================================================

Melanie, this was incredible. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to share or anything else you want to leave listeners with? You've been extremely extensive.

I don't think I've got anything else. That's the goal. 

With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Melanie, are you ready? Let's go. First question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people? 

One of the books I love is The Power of Moments. It talks, I'm supposed to be really fast and not tell you about it. 

It's all good. Okay, two books, The Power of Moments. One of the books early on I read was Designing the Obvious, which I found very insightful. 

Okay. I like that you shifted to fast mode. You don't have to go super fast. All good. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love? 

Not Canva. I love the Car Map. It is my daily companion. I use it to meditate. I use it to listen to music. I just find it very calming. 

Okay. First question, I usually ask about movies and TV shows. I hear you don't watch a lot because you're so busy enough, so much going on. I'm going to try a new question. I haven't asked before. I'm curious where this goes. Excluding Canva, what's a product you'd love to work on someday, whether it's like an existing other company, like, oh, I wish I could work on that thing, or just a new product you'd love to build maybe after the Canva chapter? 

I feel like my Canva chapter is going to go on for a long time. I don't know. I'm going to say. I'm going to say. I've got two separate plans that are pretty extensive. Maybe a company you'd love to fund. There we go. 

I feel like there is a lot of opportunity to create global infrastructure that is truly empowering. And so as I look at my 2050 wall, I think there's a lot of things that are currently only exclusively available to a small number of people that should be available to everyone. So the more that we can do to uplift the rising tide lifts or boats, I think, is a thing that's just so of such critical importance. 

And I think there is this weird belief that you can be fine and everyone else can be not fine, and that's all cool. I don't think that's cool. I think everyone suffers in such a case. So I think more things that help everyone to rise. 

Maybe along those lines, but maybe not. Is there a life motto that you find yourself coming back to in working your own life? 

There's a few. I love the quote, happiness is when what you think, what you say and what you do are in harmony. I feel like that's a constant aspiration. 

And then I've just been so obsessed lately with the idea that everything is led by imagination, that imagination is the very first step of that creative process. So everything is good because once imagined is a quote you're going to be seeing from Canva all the time now because it is true that if you don't imagine it, you can't will it into existence. 

And in fact, everything great that we experienced in life was first imagined. Wow, there's so much power to that. One thought nugget there is just there's always tools now that can make building so much easier. You can just build anything you want, just describe it. But so many people are just like, I'm going to say, but I'm just stuck. What do I want? I don't even. Like, I don't know what I mean. What should I build? And that's exactly what you're talking about there. 

Okay. Last question. So I saw it somewhere that you were an aspiring figure skater in your early years in high school. You had to wake up at 4:30 a.m. to practice. Is there something you learned from that period of your life that was helpful in building Canva? 

Oh, you so many things are quite directly applicable falling down over and over again and getting up and trying again. The importance of hard work and determination. I think the falling down, like it was quite literal in my figure skating in days. And maybe it's a little more metaphorical in today, but it is constant. 

To your right. I wonder what that metaphor is for figure skating. I don't know. Anyway, Melanie, this was incredible. I am so thankful that you agreed to do this. 

Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to maybe reach out, send you maybe feedback and canvass or join Canva? And how can listeners be useful to you? 

Really great questions. So you can find me on LinkedIn. That's where I post the most. And you can go to and I can get the URL to give us your wishes and we want to hear them and we literally listen to them. It doesn't just go into a suggestion box. 

And then how can they be helpful? Use Canva, spread Canva, teach Canva. We're doing a Canva World Tour in through October, which is probably going to be outdated and this is posted. We do events all around the world and we'd love to see you and to hear from you. 

And if you are in a company, starting a company, try and do the 1% pledge. Try and figure out your own version of the two-step plan and try and build products. And in every decision that you make that actually makes the world that you want to live in. 

I think there's this kind of belief sometimes that the world is created by other people, but we all have a very active hand in creating the world that we live in. And every decision that you make, for investors, every company that you fund, is that contributing the world to the world that you want to live in? Or is it creating the freight train that none of us want to be on? 

I have to ask before I let you go, are you going to have the rap dancers at the next Canva event? 

You'll have to wait and see.
