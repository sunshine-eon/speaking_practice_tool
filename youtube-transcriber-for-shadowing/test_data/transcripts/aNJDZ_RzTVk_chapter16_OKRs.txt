[00:00] and strategy, financial plan, roadmap.
[00:03] I think where we landed on with OKRs
[00:05] were really around more cross-functional things
[00:09] in nature.
[00:09] So for example, we'll have an OKR
[00:12] around winning a specific market.
[00:15] And we'll have OKRs that are cross-functional
[00:17] across different teams.
[00:19] But again, an OKR is just a method
[00:21] to measure an objective with metrics.
[00:26] And you can use them at various levels of granularity.
[00:29] I stay away from them from a product perspective.
[00:31] Because again, I want to focus on velocity, which is just
[00:34] output, which is your roadmap.
[00:37] They're pretty strong at more of the cross-functional side
[00:41] of things as well as the financial side of things.
[00:44] I don't even know what separates an OKR from not an OKR.
[00:48] I feel like OKRs are just a goal
[00:51] with some high-level statements of things
[00:53] we're trying to accomplish.
[00:54] I don't even understand when people
[00:56] say they use OKRs or don't, what that even means anymore.
[00:59] There's a recurring point on this podcast
[01:00] and other posts of just people are weary of just being obsessed
[01:03] with here's the metric that we're going to hit
[01:05] and that's all that matters.
[01:07] And there's a fear they lose sight of the bigger picture
[01:09] what they're trying to accomplish.
[01:10] But I think in the end, it's just like, here's what we're
[01:12] trying to do, here's some goals we're going to hit.
[01:14] Like, is that an OKR?
[01:15] I don't know.
[01:16] I think that's right.
[01:16] I think that's right.
[01:17] And at the end of the day, the contract
[01:20] is your product roadmap.
[01:22] And that's the contract you have to the sales organization.
[01:25] Marketing can take that product roadmap
[01:27] and create market moments.
[01:28] And ultimately, if your product roadmap doesn't actually
[01:32] hit the goals of the company, then I'm accountable.
[01:35] Because I've created a system by which
[01:38] I've aligned with each team on why the roadmap is going
[01:40] to hit the goals.
[01:42] And so you essentially need to point back
[01:44] to the leader in that regard.
[01:46] But I can't ask every team to try
[01:48] to manipulate OKRs to fit their roadmaps.
[01:51] That's just completely exhausting.
[01:53] We've aligned on what we need to do, let's get it done.
[01:55] Something that comes across pretty clearly
[01:57] in the way you think and the way Ramp operates
[01:58] is this idea of thinking from first principles.
[02:01] And it's kind of a cliche term.
[02:03] It feels like everyone's always trying
[02:04] to talk about how they're thinking from first principles,
[02:06] and it's important to their.
