============================================================

[00:00] because Silicon Valley often treats design as a service organization.
[00:03] You know, like design is catching things before it go out the door.
[00:06] It's not actually typically part of the development process.
[00:08] And I think this is not just bad for design,
[00:10] it's bad for product managers and engineers
[00:12] because we all want to build the best products.
[00:14] And one day you wake up and a variety of phenomena might have happened
[00:18] and if people are watching this from a large company,
[00:20] here might be some of the characteristics.
[00:22] The first thing you notice is that these different groups
[00:24] might be running on slightly different technical stacks.
[00:27] That's the first problem.
[00:28] And they may actually be a two-milion technical debt.
[00:31] The next problem you'll see is that there's a lot of dependencies.
[00:36] So five teams are going in different directions,
[00:39] but they all need a payment platform.
[00:41] And so that once it happens is that the teams that everyone's dependent on
[00:45] get this backup like a deli and people are going around the block.
[00:48] And then they are basically like, at some point, they just kind of give up.
[00:52] So then the teams that are dependent on other people say,
[00:57] give me the resources and I'll build this group myself.
[01:00] So instead of five teams going to marketing to get a campaign
[01:04] or to leverage some service,
[01:06] they start building their own marketing departments, their own groups.
[01:09] So now they're really becoming separate divisions.
[01:12] And this is where division comes from.
[01:14] Now once you have a division, your division is as successful as you are a priority.
[01:19] So now you have to advocate for your division.
[01:22] So there's a lot of advocacy.
[01:23] If you have dependencies, you've got to persuade people by building relationships.
[01:28] And so the people that are like that build the best relationships
[01:31] are the ones that get the most resources.
[01:33] And that creates what we call politics.
[01:35] And so now politics that brood in the company.
[01:38] And suddenly people gets more subdivided, more subdivided, subdivided.
[01:44] And that creates another problem, which we call bureaucracy.
[01:47] And that bureaucracy means it's hard to know who's doing what.
[01:51] You can't, like people are going in different directions.
[01:53] And that creates a lack of accountability.
[01:55] When there's lack of accountability, then there's a sense that what I do doesn't matter.
[01:59] And that creates complacency.
[02:01] And then suddenly a fast growing company becomes a big slow moving bureaucracy.
[02:06] This is a general arc, a winds up happening.
[02:09] And then you end up having this situation where companies done like 10 marketing efforts,
[02:15] but no customers heard anything.
[02:17] They have thousands of engineers.
[02:18] They shipped all these products, but a customer can't tell you a single thing you did.
[02:22] And, you know, marketing and engineering, like, don't talk to each other.
[02:26] It's not even they hate each other.
[02:27] They're like in different universes.
[02:29] I've always said that the health of an organization, one simple heuristic is how close there's engineering and marketing.
[02:35] And marketing is a lot of companies are like the waiters.
[02:39] Engineers are like the chefs and the chefs yell at the waiters.
[02:42] They go in the kitchen.
[02:43] In fact, the waiters, though, when talking to the customers all day,
[02:46] and they also know how it's a cell thing.
[02:48] So you really want them being joined at the hip and you want engineers to be thinking about maybe how to talk about the products that they're building.
[02:55] So this is the problem that we had.
