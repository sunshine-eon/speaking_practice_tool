============================================================

[00:00] Awesome. So I've never heard of a version of this with so much depth into the landscape.
[00:04] And I think that's so smart because so much of conflict and disagreement comes from,
[00:10] you just don't have the same information. Or the manager, exec, whatever, doesn't think
[00:14] you have the information. So if you just lean into, here's everything that I know.
[00:17] And here's what's happening. And if you disagree with this goal, tell me in the middle
[00:20] change of the plan. Right. And part of it's also that, typically speaking,
[00:26] when you're doing a strategy, you're doing it at a higher level.
[00:31] So I don't think every product needs a strategy. Every feature doesn't need a strategy,
[00:38] for example. You don't need to do this if you're working on a tiny slice of a product
[00:43] and you have user feedback. Don't over complicate it. Just do the stuff that makes sense.
[00:47] But especially as I've gotten more senior in my career, the questions are bigger
[00:52] and the impact is broader and the timelines are longer. And honestly, it was also because I wanted
[00:59] to get it right. I didn't want to make a bet on something and put a bunch of resources against a
[01:04] problem and get it wrong. And so this was also homework that I wanted to do for myself to know
[01:08] that I was going to do the right thing. For some reason, I'm always paranoid that other
[01:13] people have more information or are doing it better than I'm doing it. And so I was like,
[01:17] okay, I have to write it all down and then make sure I got it right and share it with
[01:21] everyone and make sure that they agreed with me so that I didn't screw this thing up.
[01:24] And it just was such a useful exercise that I kept doing it. And of course,
[01:29] people don't read it. People only read a tiny section. You'll run to the same problems,
[01:33] you're running with everything else, but at least I knew that I had done the work and
[01:35] that people cared to engage with it. It was there.
[01:37] So on those lines, I was going to actually ask, how long do you find this should be
[01:42] depending either on the time scale? Say you're doing a quarterly strategy or a year,
[01:47] how many pages should this doc be? Any guy? It's long. It gets real long.
[01:53] Like what is long? I've had some because
[01:58] the actual content, I end up writing a summary to go back to the Minto
[02:02] principle. I end up like doing the whole thing, then putting a summary at the top so that the
[02:06] one within the first above the fold, if you will, you can kind of get the whole
[02:11] the point and the suggestion on what I think we should do or what the strategy should be
[02:15] should be summarizable in that section. But it can go 20 pages just because if you really
[02:21] want to get deep in a competitor or there's interesting market dynamics,
[02:25] interesting technological changes that are happening, sometimes I'm screen shotting
[02:32] other companies' marketing websites and dumping that in there and that might be
[02:36] some interesting content. So it doesn't have to just be words or it can be all
[02:39] kinds of different things that you might want to put in there.
[02:42] And you made the point that it's not like you expect people to read this whole thing.
[02:46] There's the summary that gives them a conclusion and in theory, if they want to
[02:50] really dig into it, they can. But I guess how do you find that balance of writing
[02:54] everything you know and making it so long that no one's ever going to read it to like,
[02:58] here's actually going to be useful to someone and plus here's a summary.
[03:03] It comes back to the reason why I write the document in the first place and that's for me.
[03:09] So it's my homework to do my job effectively. I just make sure to share it. And I find that
[03:17] especially my engineering and design counterparts, if you're working in a true
[03:20] triad, will almost always engage really deeply on the dock because they're
[03:24] pretty much also on the line and they want to make sure that when they sign their teams
[03:28] up to do whatever it is that they believe in the thing that you're working on.
[03:32] And so I find that those people will engage pretty deeply. Sometimes you'll have
[03:37] more junior folks on the team that'll just be interested and they'll get really into it too.
[03:42] And then there's some people that'll skim the upfront part and either say,
[03:47] yeah, that looks great or you're done. I hate this. And like, okay, sure. There's always those people.
[03:52] So it never really mattered to me that people read the whole thing. It was more,
[03:56] I knew I had to do it to be confident in my own decisions and then I could facilitate a
[04:00] conversation so it didn't really matter. This episode is brought to you by Epo.
[04:06] Epo is a next generation AB testing and feature management platform
[04:10] built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams,
[04:14] companies like Twitch, Muro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Epo to power their experiments.
[04:20] Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the
[04:24] performance of new features. And Epo helps you increase experimentation velocity while
[04:29] unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does.
[04:33] When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I left most was our experimentation platform,
[04:37] where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues and analyze performance all on my
[04:42] own. Epo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shape weeks
[04:47] off experiment time and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out of the box
[04:52] reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles. Epo also makes
[04:57] it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the
[05:01] AB testing flywheel. Epo powers experimentation across every use case, including product,
[05:07] growth, machine learning, monetization and email marketing. Check out Epo at GetEpo.com
[05:13] slash Lenny and 10x your experiment velocity. That's GetEPPO.com slash Lenny.
[05:21] Was there an example of a strategy you were thinking about recently or that you worked on
[05:24] in the past just to give people something concrete of like, here's what Maggie thinks of
[05:29] as a question she's going to develop a strategy around?
[05:33] Yeah, I think, I mean, it's obviously this is where product content gets really challenging
[05:38] because I obviously can't really talk about the stuff I'm currently working on.
[05:41] Just tell us all of the secrets and nobody will know.
[05:43] The Toast PR department would be really unhappy with me.
[05:49] It's questions like, you know, if you're a director of product somewhere, right? Maybe
[05:54] you're running a section of a business and it's annual planning. We're in Q4. What are you going
[06:00] to do next year? How do you answer that question? What do you put? How do you back up your choices
[06:06] for that? You use a doc like this. Maybe you are realizing that the product that you're working on
[06:12] doesn't really matter. It's not really making an impact. You're kind of treading water.
[06:17] I would use this as a tool to figure out, okay, well, what else could you do?
[06:21] So yeah, quarterly planning, annual planning, if you feel like your team needs to make a pivot,
[06:27] or if you think that there's a really interesting new opportunity that your business
[06:30] or your team should go after is another time I might use something like this.
