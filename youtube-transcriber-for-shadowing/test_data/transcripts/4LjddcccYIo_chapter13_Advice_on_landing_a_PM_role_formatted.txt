============================================================

If someone is listening and they're not a PM, and they are not convinced to not get into product management, they still want to become a PM. What is your best advice for someone that is trying to get into product management and how to actually break into it? I thought about this one a lot and consulted the Slack Workspace team because it's been a long time since I tried to get into product. I didn't know what was going on these days because it's hard, and I hadn't, I don't know if things have changed.

You know, I went to business school, and that's how I got in. There was a program that took MBA students. I think there are some entry-level programs out there at big tech companies. If you can get them, I think they're really hard to get because they're very few and far between. The most common two paths that I've seen are people who switch laterally within a company, which is again challenging but can be done, or people who join startups.

At my last startup, I hired someone who was coming out of business school who hadn't been into product into a PM role. I can't say I wouldn't do it because it was awesome, and she was amazing, but it takes a lot of work. The reason why people don't do it is that as a manager, it takes a lot of work because there's so much that these people need to learn. What we ended up doing is she and I spent four months working together in a WeWork in person to help her onboard really quickly into the role, which was so rewarding. I loved every second of it and wish I could do that again and again.

To get that, she basically just hounded me. Christine, if you're listening, you emailed me a lot, we talked a lot, and we waited till the time was right. You finally convinced me to do it. I don't know if there's a reliable path that I can say, like this is what my advice would be, other than try a startup, network, and see what you can do.

Another key piece is that once you have a PM title on your resume, everything gets easier. As a hiring manager, I look at a resume and think, "Oh, they've never been a PM." This isn't the role. Rarely does someone want someone who's never been a PM. I talk to lots of people who either are in product or want to be in product, and that's one of the things I always tell them. If they're deciding between roles and have an opportunity to do something, my advice is always, if you can get someone to stamp you with the product manager role, take it.

To your point, it's what we screen on. For better or worse, you just have to get that first job. Once you get that first job, it all gets easier because you can get in and then talk about your experience. The second question I have is, "What have you shipped?" It's fascinating how quickly people can't answer that question, and those who can are always several steps ahead of the people who can't.
