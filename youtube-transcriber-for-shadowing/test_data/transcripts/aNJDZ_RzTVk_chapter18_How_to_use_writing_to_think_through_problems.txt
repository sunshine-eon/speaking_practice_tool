============================================================

[00:00] to detail your ability to articulate your approach to product. And as we were working on this, you
[00:05] mentioned that writing is really important to you as a way of figuring out what you think
[00:11] and to solve and crystallize problems, which is exactly how it works for me. And that's how
[00:14] this whole newsletter started. I was just trying to crystallize what I remembered and did
[00:18] so that I can remember it and share with people. So I'd love to just hear your insights
[00:23] and take on just what writing does for you and maybe what you'd recommend listeners do with
[00:29] this kind of approach of writing, helping them think. Throughout the years at Ramp,
[00:34] I was often faced with a problem or question that that I couldn't answer off the bat. And I had to
[00:41] go back to first principles. And the best way of doing that is to shut down your laptop,
[00:48] you know, take out a piece of paper, write the question as simply as possible at the top
[00:53] of the paper, and just spend time just thinking about how to answer that question.
[00:57] And there were there were a ton of questions over time. For example,
[01:01] you know, how do we and it was all scalability problems that few companies have actually
[01:06] done successfully. And so you have to start with your own thinking. How do we scale decision
[01:12] making? How do we incentivize teams to work together? How do we do headcount planning?
[01:17] How do we allocate headcount in a fair way? How do we avoid politics as firsthand data
[01:25] goes away? How do we make decisions on on doubling down versus pivoting? All these things are
[01:32] really tough. And and I found myself, you know, you could you could you could read
[01:37] things and that's helpful. But I don't think that reading makes you necessarily think better.
[01:44] It makes you more wise. But the best way to to increase your capacity to think is to
[01:50] actually do the thinking. And so that's where I see I see writing, if you're able to write things
[01:55] clearly, you're able to think through things clearly. It was also a way for me to effectively
[01:59] communicate, especially during like a COVID where like, we largely grew up during COVID,
[02:04] where everything was written. And it was also a way for me to get content out there to
[02:10] increase, you know, my my brand and ramps brand and in terms of the space that then
[02:15] led us to hire, you know, better people over time. So all these things kind of worked out,
[02:20] but it does require you to block out time and to again, focus on how you think about problems
[02:29] rather than try to Google the answer, you know, after you thought through it, then then go out and
[02:34] read and you'll you'll fine tune your thinking and you'll identify new new questions to ask
[02:39] yourself afterwards. I love this advice. You mentioned earlier that PMs can't really do much
[02:46] on their own. But I think this is the thing PMs can do is PMs have the time to think and to
