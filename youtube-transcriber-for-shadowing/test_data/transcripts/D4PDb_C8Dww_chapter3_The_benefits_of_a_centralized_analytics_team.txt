============================================================

[00:00] Awesome. So it's, in a sense, it is embedded. They're embedded in cross-functional teams
[00:04] across the org, but they report up to essential org to you, essentially, in the end.
[00:09] Yeah.
[00:10] Colt. What are some of the benefits of this approach?
[00:12] Oh, there's so many. Okay. So the first thing is a consistent and high talent bar.
[00:17] I think this is, this is something I saw when we would have some sort of pockets
[00:22] of, of analytics folks embedded is the, having a consistent bar for talent in terms
[00:28] of what we're looking for, what are the technical skills, what are the soft skills,
[00:32] and being able to kind of evaluate candidates with that same bar, using sort of our same rubric.
[00:43] Just, you just get more consistent and higher, higher talent, in my opinion.
[00:49] I think that's number one. Number two is actually growth opportunities.
[00:52] So if you're siloed, you may be the most senior data person within,
[00:57] keep picking on marketing, but you might be the most senior sort of data scientist
[01:02] within marketing. Where do you go from there? I think when you have the central org,
[01:05] you're able to see if there are growth opportunities in other areas within the company.
[01:12] And so that really helps folks to stay engaged because they can look at new problems
[01:19] if the kind of problems they've been working on for several years or getting maybe boring
[01:24] and they want something new, there's an opportunity move from marketing over to merchant analytics.
[01:30] And then I think similarly, if there isn't a promotion or room to grow,
[01:35] if you want to be a people manager and there just isn't a people management role,
[01:39] kind of within your functional area, well, you've got 10 other ones to look at
[01:46] and maybe there is that opportunity. So I think it helps with the growth
[01:50] opportunities for the team, which helps to retain talent.
[01:53] So that's a second thing. The third thing is just consistency of methodologies and metrics.
[01:59] So you don't have sales that was as defined by one team and sales as defined by another team.
[02:05] You just have sales and everybody is using kind of the same metrics,
[02:10] the same, the same methodologies.
[02:13] And you're able to improve your methodologies with input from, you know,
[02:16] more people and rather than kind of recreating the wheel,
[02:20] doing the same, building the same churn prediction model on six different teams,
[02:25] you can instead build one and have the input of six different teams.
[02:29] I think that's a definitely another benefit also helps you just scale
[02:33] because you start to see the same problems across teams.
[02:37] And so you're like, oh, this is an issue that we need to get ahead of.
[02:40] This is something we need to automate or this is something that we need to
[02:44] to improve upon or a problem that is going to grow as our business, as our team scales.
[02:49] So I think it helps you see around corners a little bit more.
[02:53] And then just lastly, there's the team culture brand.
[02:58] I think that's really important, not just externally for recruiting top talent,
[03:02] but the team is really proud to be members of the analytics team.
[03:06] We have a unique culture of learning, of sharing.
[03:11] You have someone you can go to to talk about your challenges.
[03:14] You have someone who can peer review your work.
[03:16] I think just having that team culture that we have is really important.
[03:22] And it's a lot harder to get when you have the individual silos,
[03:27] particularly in an earlier stage when it's a smaller team.
[03:30] You just don't have as many people around.
[03:33] So everybody wants to have friends at work and we're creating an environment
[03:37] where they can find like-minded kind of data nerds.
[03:41] It makes me think about Airbnb's first data team.
[03:43] I don't know if Riley Newman, well, but he built Airbnb's first data team.
[03:47] And it was actually an analytics team.
[03:48] They called themselves the A team on the point of culture
[03:52] and that always felt a lot of fun and they loved being part of that team.
[03:57] Yeah, we have the same thing, but now I feel a lot less special
[04:01] for coming up with that name.
[04:03] Oh, you called it A team also?
[04:04] Yeah, without the A team.
[04:07] And then I think they moved away from it when there was a push.
[04:09] Now we're data scientists.
[04:10] We're not analytics or analysts.
[04:12] And that was like a, I don't know, 10 year ago, like a data science.
[04:16] We're data scientists.
[04:17] We will always be the A team.
