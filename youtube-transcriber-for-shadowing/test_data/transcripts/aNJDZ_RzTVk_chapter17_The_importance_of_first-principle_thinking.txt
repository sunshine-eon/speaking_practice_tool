============================================================

[00:00] culture to think from first principles.
[00:02] But it feels like you guys actually do it.
[00:04] And so I am curious just where that emerged for you
[00:08] and or for Ramp.
[00:09] And is there an example of something that emerged
[00:13] within Ramp, a new product or an idea
[00:14] that was very clearly from first principles?
[00:18] Most important thing to talk about here
[00:19] is that Ramp is a very unique business.
[00:23] I mean, we're a credit card company
[00:27] which is all about risk management and underwriting.
[00:31] We're also a payments company
[00:32] because we move money between businesses.
[00:35] We're also a software company
[00:36] because we deal with defense management
[00:38] and expense management, accounting,
[00:41] we're building for SMEs.
[00:43] So we have PLG, but we're also building for enterprise
[00:45] so we are sales driven, we're everything.
[00:47] And so it's really important
[00:50] when you're dealing with something
[00:51] that hasn't been done before
[00:53] to think from first principles.
[00:55] And what I mean by that is you don't pattern match
[00:59] from your past experience,
[01:01] but you go back to the fundamentals
[01:02] of what we're trying to do
[01:03] and you think through them very, very deeply.
[01:05] And that means you need to hire people
[01:09] who can think from first principles
[01:12] and be okay putting aside their experience.
[01:15] And that's a tough pill to swallow for some folks
[01:17] who will come in and will say,
[01:20] I'm the subject matter expert on XYZ
[01:23] and I know what's best.
[01:24] And they come in and they get a reality check
[01:26] about the complexity of our business
[01:28] and how also you can't influence teams
[01:30] by saying I've seen this before.
[01:32] That's just like an anti-pattern,
[01:34] like you can't say my past company, XYZ.
[01:37] No, no one wants to hear that.
[01:39] No one wants to hear that.
[01:41] And so, and surely I thought I was coming into ramp
[01:44] and I was gonna apply the best product development process
[01:46] and I had to shift that process entirely
[01:48] because the process was predicated
[01:50] on a B plus engineering team
[01:52] and I was faced with an A plus engineering team.
[01:53] So my entire, I had to go back to first principles
[01:55] around how product should be developed and built.
[01:58] So again, like all the advice I'm sharing here,
[02:00] don't just take it and map it and copy paste.
[02:03] Start from the first principles that we're sharing.
[02:07] An example of that is our support team.
[02:10] So support reports into me
[02:12] and the first principle there was saying,
[02:14] well, every support ticket is a failure of our product.
[02:18] We literally have that as a quote
[02:20] just posted on all those channels.
[02:23] It's a failure and if the product works perfectly,
[02:27] no one should ever have to contact our support team.
[02:30] And what better way of holding the product team
[02:32] accountable for support
[02:34] other than having support report into product?
[02:37] And the second piece was that
[02:39] we believe that a lot of our value to our customers
[02:45] because it was gonna come from deeply understanding them,
[02:47] deeply listening to them
[02:49] and moving on that feedback.
[02:51] And so instead of hiring people
[02:53] who were focused just on resolving the ticket,
[02:57] we incentivized people to actually decrease
[03:00] number of tickets over time and decrease deflection
[03:03] or increased deflection
[03:04] and that required hiring a different breed of people
[03:07] that then became leaders
[03:09] in different parts of the organization as well.
[03:10] So again, we could have easily just pattern matched,
[03:14] look at comparables,
[03:15] hired people who've scaled large support teams
[03:18] and just use like benchmarks in the industry.
[03:21] But we've started from first principles
[03:23] and the outcome of that is,
[03:24] we have an extremely low contact rate.
[03:27] We have over 400,000 users on our platform
[03:30] and a team of agents that's under 30.
[03:33] And it's a pretty crazy ratio to think about.
[03:37] That's wild.
[03:39] I miss this nuance.
[03:40] So the support team reports into you
[03:43] and the product team?
[03:44] Yes.
[03:45] Wow, I've never heard of that.
[03:47] That's cool.
[03:48] Okay, so I'm going to change course a little bit
[03:52] and I'm going to talk about writing.
[03:54] So we worked on this post together on how ramp operates
[03:57] and I was just incredibly impressed with your attention.
