============================================================

I think that's such an interesting insight, especially that the first thing you said around how the more often and the more crowded the space is, the more opportunity there is for design to be a differentiator. Is that roughly how you think about it?

Yeah. So I mean, just think about, I don't know, any product category. It's like, basically people have then like lower choices and then they like, how do they make choices? Maybe there's a specific thing they want, but a lot of people don't necessarily know what is the specific feature I want from this software. So it's more like, well, what is the best one? What is the highest quality one? 

If you put things side by side and people see things, people are visual. The design can be one of those things that stands out, like, well, that looks the best or that looks the most like a quality product to me. So I'm going to use that one. When people have a lot of choices, they probably will pick the one that looks most interesting.

Then I think there is the second part, which is the brand. If you can build a brand, then I think it doesn't really matter what the product is. It becomes this kind of default choice. I don't know, like again, Apple or Nike. There are all kinds of shoes you can buy, but there's a reason for someone to buy Nike shoes over some random brand. Even if the random brand would actually be a better shoe, they still buy Nike because they like the brand.

So then I think both the design of the product and the design of the brand can be very strong factors that pull people to your company or to the product.
