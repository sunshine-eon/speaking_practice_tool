You mentioned the principles of the company, and I was going to touch on one of these actually. What's the URL to check these out? By the way, we'll link to it in the show notes. 

Yeah, 37signals.com. 

Okay, right. Just the homepage. 

Yeah, yeah. The homepage, yeah. 

One of them is "work isn't war." You wrote a book about this, roughly, about how work doesn't have to suck. Can you just talk about why work feels like war, and then what maybe people could do to make it feel less like war? 

This is about words in a lot of ways. I don't have the page in front of me right now, but essentially, a lot of work uses war metaphors. You're targeting customers, conquering a market. Gosh, now I really want to make sure I get all these right. So hang on, I'm just going to look this up because these things are how people talk about work. 

It says they conquer the market, capture mind share, target customers, employ a sales force, hire head hunters, destroy the competition, pick battles, and make a killing. That's how people talk about business. I find that to be depressing. It just feels depressing to me. 

We use words to establish a perspective and a way of thinking about the world. If those are the words that are in your head, then you feel like it's this war. People are always asking, "What do the Navy SEALs do?" And they're like, "Yeah, that's the Navy SEALs, man. It's not your software business." 

We always look to Navy SEALs and military strategies to tell us how to run a business. They've got a group of eight, and they do amazing things, obviously. But what you're doing is making B2B accounting software. Let's just chill for a second here. 

I like to think of words that are more additive and alternative. Let's exist. Let's make something great, not like "let's beat them" or "let's conquer them." Let's just make something great. I think that matters, and it changes the way you think about the work that you do. 

It's more about pride and excitement and a spirit of creation than it is about destruction. If you go into it with destruction in mind, you're going to end up in a pretty dark place. So that's our point of view.
