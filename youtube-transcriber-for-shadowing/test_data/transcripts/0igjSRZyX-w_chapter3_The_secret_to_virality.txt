[00:00] fences.
[00:01] Okay.
[00:01] Well, I have to follow this thread that you put out there of what the
[00:04] secret is to morality.
[00:05] What, what did you learn there?
[00:07] Well, my first one and one, I sat down with Elliot and I said, Hey, I'm
[00:11] here to learn, please teach me everything that you know about
[00:15] morality.
[00:16] And he said, okay, well, hate to burst your bubble, but there is no such
[00:22] thing as a truly viral product.
[00:26] I said, what do you mean?
[00:27] How do you explain Facebook?
[00:28] For that matter, how do you explain LinkedIn?
[00:31] And he said, what I mean is no app has sustained a viral factor of
[00:38] greater than one for any real period of time.
[00:43] Even Facebook in its heyday had a viral factor of about 0.7 and he
[00:48] told me that lasted for perhaps a year.
[00:50] So one person was creating about 0.7 new users.
[00:55] And I double clicked again.
[00:56] And I said, well, Elliot, what about the address book import?
[01:00] This is one of the things that LinkedIn got famous or infamous for.
[01:03] You could import your address book and then it would spam slash invite
[01:08] everyone who happens to be members of LinkedIn in your address book.
[01:11] And then eventually it would just invite everyone to LinkedIn.
[01:14] And he said, that's an amazing feature, but you have to remember not
[01:17] everyone is going to use it all the time.
[01:19] So even that feature had a lifetime viral factor of about 0.4.
[01:26] And that's considered good.
[01:28] So 0.4 is good for a viral feature.
[01:30] 0.6 is great.
[01:32] Something like 0.7 is absolutely incredible.
[01:35] You're in the stratosphere upward Facebook at that time.
[01:40] So I said, well, okay, all of these things by definition are going to
[01:43] peter out.
[01:43] There's going to be an asymptote.
[01:45] None of these viral mechanics keep on compounding, which actually makes
[01:50] sense.
[01:50] It would be a little absurd if things just kept on growing.
[01:53] What then is the true secret behind virality?
[01:57] And he said, it is word of mouth.
[02:01] It is the virality you can't measure that isn't a mechanic that isn't
[02:04] in a feature.
[02:05] It is when one user spontaneously tells another user about your product.
[02:12] And that really colored how I think about growth and virality.
[02:15] Since then it has shaped so much of what we do at superhuman and so
[02:19] much of how I think about growing brands.
[02:22] Wow.
[02:22] You're such a great storyteller.
[02:24] I'm just like listening here.
[02:25] It's captivated.
[02:26] What is he going to say next?
[02:27] That was fascinating.
[02:28] I actually have a post that I'm going to that very much aligns with what
[02:32] you're talking about, which is titled, Viralities of Myth.
[02:35] Mostly.
[02:37] And it's based on, I forget it on this book where they do all this research on
[02:39] like actual viruses.
[02:42] And it turns out they're not actually spreading in this like exponential way.
[02:45] There's like one person that spreads it to a lot of people and it keeps happening.
[02:50] And that's actually apparently what the data shows.
[02:53] And I'm curious if you found this same thing, which is when people think of it
[02:57] app is going viral, it's like one person with a massive platform sharing it.
[03:01] And their audience adopts it.
[03:02] And it's like, that's just one to many.
[03:05] And then it just happens a couple of times and it looks like it's going viral,
[03:07] but it's like a person too many people, not many people to many people thoughts
[03:12] on that.
[03:13] Yeah, we've definitely found that there are whales to use the gaming terminology
[03:18] that one person is going to be responsible for inviting 25, 50, a hundred people.
[03:25] And they may have various motivations for doing that in superhuman as an
[03:28] individual subscriber.
[03:29] If you refer somebody else and they sign up, you both get a free month, which
[03:35] is a great incentive if you're paying out of pocket.
[03:38] So we have people who send many, many hundreds of invites and there are some
[03:44] people who essentially have free superhuman for life now, due to how many
[03:48] people they've invited.
[03:49] But of course that incentive doesn't necessarily work inside of a company or
[03:54] inside of a team where ultimately it's the company paying for the product.
[03:58] So you have to then come up with new motivations for the.
