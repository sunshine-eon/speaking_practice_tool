============================================================

[00:00] So just to summarize so far, if no metrics, you have no experiments, you have essentially
[00:07] no PMs, just one product leader, you spend a lot of time on design and craft and making
[00:13] things awesome.
[00:16] I'm curious just what you think it takes to make a company work in that way because
[00:19] this is pretty different from how a lot of other founders think and a lot of other
[00:24] product teams work.
[00:25] We like to talk about this internally, this mixture of magic and science and how we
[00:32] describe this.
[00:33] There's always some level of science that we do, and I think some companies are
[00:37] very scientific on their product management that they like to measure
[00:40] everything and they do a lot of tests and things, but we just decided we
[00:47] don't think that's necessary or that's good for us.
[00:51] So the science for us means that we do talk to users a lot and the whole project we
[00:59] start with, we do some level of user research and as founders, different
[01:04] people on the team, we might have weekly calls with customers or users.
[01:09] We also encourage everyone on the team to go to the customer slack, they answer
[01:13] people's questions.
[01:15] We have shared slack channels with customers.
[01:18] Anyone I sometimes go answer the questions there, I also see when they complain
[01:22] about something.
[01:23] I think the first part is the whole team has to be really understanding
[01:30] the product and the customers and the problems people are facing and kind of
[01:34] have that empathy as well as the understanding what is the state of
[01:39] things today and then we talk about that and then sometimes we might pull
[01:44] up stats and see like, oh, I wonder like, is there some kind of patterns we see
[01:48] like, okay, these kind of companies are using this thing more and what do we
[01:52] think about it?
[01:53] But usually we have some kind of question we want to answer.
[01:55] It's like, I wonder what is going on and then we look at it versus like,
[02:00] let's just pull some metrics and then decide that we should increase this
[02:03] metric.
[02:04] And then the magic part is like, what happens when you kind of build
[02:07] this understanding like everyone in the company builds, it's not like
[02:11] everyone has the same understanding, but like everyone builds more of that
[02:14] customer and product understanding, then like, we have discussions like,
[02:19] what should we be doing or what decision we want to make here, then
[02:24] everyone is much more like kind of informed of the actual reality of
[02:29] the customers or the product and then we think like, you can much
[02:35] more like use your intuition or thinking to do those decisions that
[02:40] you don't have to use data or metrics to back those things up.
[02:44] So that's like, I think the main thing is like the whole company kind of has
[02:48] to like be with the customers or like talk to them and then like
[02:52] understand like where the product might work well or where it might
