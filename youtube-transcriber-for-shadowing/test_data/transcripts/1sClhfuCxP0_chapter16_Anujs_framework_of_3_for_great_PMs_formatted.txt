============================================================

Is there something folks should look for that will tell them they probably shouldn't be a product manager, whether it's motivation, skill set, background, or anything? No, I don't think about particular domains that you come from. I have, again, a simple framework of three. 

I think the first thing is essentially raw sharpness, and that can manifest itself in problem identification and problem solving. That's one. Not so hard rotors in all of that, and that is super important. The second one is what I call drive or grit, because I think with that comes a whole bunch of qualities around curiosity, learnability, never giving up, and consumer backward thinking. I would really want to solve this, and all of that comes with that. 

The third, which is a little different, is influence. You're in the business of influence, and if you can kind of see yourself as someone who is built this way or wants to really get better at these skills, that's when I think this field is going to serve you well. 

I love that everything is in threes. How handy! Only the babies are four. I wish I could come up with something like that. There are too many things to do there. Essentially, these are your perspectives on the most important PM skills: a good way to think about influence, grit, and just being smart. 

And I think what you said here is important: it's not like you have to be amazing at these to get into product and do all of it. You need to be excited about getting better. Yes, that's right. Because I think it's not as if everybody is born with a lot of influence. Of course, you can get better at it, but it's just the prospect of knowing that, hey, I will need to be influential to succeed at this job. That should excite you and not scare you away. 

You should not think that, hey, you know what? I can get away from this and still be a very successful product manager, because most likely, you will not.
