============================================================

It's an awesome example, kind of along the lines of that, but also this category of freedom and responsibility. Something Netflix innovated long ago, and I'm curious if this is still a thing, is this idea of chaos monkeys, which essentially are a program that runs on your infrastructure that just kills random processes and things just to see what breaks and make sure things are stable when things actually start falling apart. Is chaos monkeys, was that what it's called in the end? Is that still a thing? Is there still some chaos monkeys running around the servers? Not unbridled chaos monkeys, no. 

Okay, it contains chaos monkeys. We carry too much responsibility, speaking of freedom and responsibility for the member experience to inject pain, though we do a lot of experiments to test resilience. That does probably mean injecting things that we're not quite sure whether A is better than B. That happens across engineering systems really at scale, but it's not for pure chaos. It's for intentional learning, so we can avoid making bigger mistakes. Then as we go into new efforts like Cloud Games, we have a beta that's out now, live would be another example. We do try to come up with intentionally low-profile examples where we can test the bounds of our systems in a way that's unlikely to damage the member experience. That's less randomness, more by design. 

We're doing that in a few places that feels mostly like good engineering practice, so we can understand when it's really showtime, and we're going to really test our systems. Will they be able to perform like we want them to? RIP chaos monkey. 

Kind of along these lines of data, data itself has always been at the heart of Netflix, and my understanding is the way the data team and the insights team is structured has been one of the reasons Netflix has been so successful, and that's the team you led before you moved into this new role. Can you just talk about how these teams are structured and why this structure is so effective? 

Yeah. I certainly like to think of it as being special. It's unusual. I can explain why. So at the scale of company that Netflix now is, very often data-oriented teams are embedded in other parts of the business. So it could either be they're embedded in a business line like ads or games, or they are organized more functionally, separating data engineers from data scientists from analytics engineers from consumer researchers. And we've resisted that and kept a centralized team that is both functionally diverse, so across all those types of functions that I just described, and works on nearly every area of the business from within the team. 

And I sort of understand why a lot of companies move away from this, because it really does require basically extraordinary partnership. That we would have people working on data problems that don't report into the teams that are relying on them. But the benefit we get is we get to think about our functional expertise. So are we really the world's best data engineers, world's best data scientists, and how do we continue to be ever better from a functional and technical perspective? It gives people better career paths because there's more mobility across the teams. It feels like a team that has a functional expertise with a lot of different problems to solve. 

And so I think it enables more cross-pollination of ideas in a way. It also allows us to be really objective. That is probably the most important thing, that our job is not to tell the story that someone wants to hear with the data, or to solve the problem that someone thinks is most important. It's for us to have our own perspective about things. And I think that that up-levels the whole organization because it means that we're able to be truth-tellers or to be curious in a way that might not fit if we had a different organizational structure. 

We have to balance that. It would be a good partner to live around the things we agreed were priorities, be flexible without spending our time. But it gives us agency and responsibility beyond that. And I feel like the team takes that very seriously. So I've seen examples of that in how we bring data to a lot of spaces, including how we partner with engineering on data-related topics, or how we partner with content that I'm not sure we would have gotten to if not for having that kernel that's sort of a center of excellence around it. 

And it's data and insights. That was the team that you ran. Insights, is that describing user research, or what does that function actually? 

So part of data and insights is a consumer insights team that includes a lot of different flavors of research, really. So in some ways, consumers even a misnomer, because there's parts of the team that do internal research, for example, on tools and products for studio productions. So that's more of a user research-oriented versus consumer. And then the parts of that team that are consumer-oriented do things all the way from content screenings to make titles the best version of themselves before they're on the service, to more traditional UX research to think about how can we deliver the best title discovery experience, or how can we think about things that improve accessibility. 

And then that team has a global remit. So there's also teams that are more local or regional expertise in understanding consumer needs and entertainment. So consumer insights and a team formerly known as, still kind of known as a shorthand, data science and engineering combined together to create data and insights probably about two years ago. That's another piece that's unusual. It becomes truly a full stack data and research expertise. 

And so we could tackle a problem like what's the right way to think about recommendations and how best to surface them in a way that combines attitudinal research, qualitative and quantitative with behavioral research on more of the data science, data engineering, and analytics side. It's super cool because I think it's really rare that what people think of user research is within the data work. And I think that might be a solution to some of the backlash a lot of user research teams get where they're like, I don't know what are you guys doing all this anecdotal evidence. If it's under the same org, I feel like that leads to a lot more credibility and avoids this like data's telling me this thing. This user research team is telling you this thing. 

Yeah, I mean, consumer insights is one of the newer teams for me. It wasn't in my background to lead a team like that and not in my individual training. But they are critical for making sure we keep a consumer orientation, a member orientation on things. And I have loved to watch the teams collaborate on problems because we talk about it as a superpower internally and combining those skill sets. So I think the consumer insights team at Netflix has had a lot of credibility in a certain area of expertise and we took it to the next level by combining it with other functional expertise. 

So it's not required in every problem space. So we try not to overdo it and say we need to be collaborating everywhere because that just feels like the wrong expectation. But we try to make the most of it in spaces where we really benefit. So yeah, it's worked out.
