============================================================

[00:00] Maybe it's the last question just again, broadly, you've gone from being an IC designer or manager
[00:06] of designers to the CEO of a very fast growing company.
[00:11] What's something that you've learned about leadership over the journey of linear that
[00:15] maybe you didn't expect?
[00:17] For some reason it was surprising to me, I think that like being a CEO or some of
[00:22] these like leadership roles is that you end up doing so many different things.
[00:27] I think when I was a designer, even if I would be like some high-level designer in some company,
[00:34] it's still like you're mostly focusing on the design and that's like your job.
[00:38] But then when you're a CEO, then it's like every week or every day there's some different
[00:43] thing going on. It's not like there's sometimes there can be problems, but a lot of times it's
[00:47] like, hey, we need to figure out how are we going to do this, how are we going to do this
[00:52] compensation or how are we going to do this marketing plan or like how are we going to do this
[00:57] like off-site thing? And so it's just like to me what it's like challenge like definitely like
[01:04] challenging for me is handling that like different kinds of things that come to you
[01:12] and like staying somewhat focused still on something. So I think it's haven't necessarily
[01:18] fully figured it out, but I also like learn figure it out that like, yeah, hiring and
[01:23] delegation helps with this that like if you can find other leaders that can like take on
[01:28] certain areas that that's helpful, that that's the like the main thing that
[01:34] that like how what is the it's like a very wide range of things that you maybe didn't have
[01:39] experience before. But also I think it's interesting to me to learn about these things
[01:43] and like you learn about financials and you learn about legal things and then you
[01:47] start to feel like, oh, actually, I know something about these things. So like over time
