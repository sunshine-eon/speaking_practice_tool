============================================================

[00:00] Okay. So what I'm going to do,
[00:02] I have one more question about AI.
[00:04] To make this work timing-wise,
[00:06] I'm going to cut the lightning round.
[00:07] So I hope that's okay.
[00:09] Totally fine.
[00:09] Okay. I know AI is very top of my head.
[00:12] By the way, this is my diabolical plan
[00:14] to have to skip the lightning round
[00:15] because that's the thing I'm not good at.
[00:17] The guy just not.
[00:18] I'm not going to lose.
[00:19] Anyway, that's the thing I was dreading the most,
[00:21] playing 4D chess here.
[00:23] You knew exactly the timing and you're like,
[00:26] I will take this long,
[00:27] all these answers that will perfectly play out.
[00:30] So now you're spending a lot of time on AI.
[00:32] It's on many people's minds these days.
[00:34] You built this product called ChatSpot.
[00:36] Is it still called ChatSpot or did you?
[00:38] Is that the product you changed the name for?
[00:39] That's still ChatSpot.
[00:40] It's still ChatSpot.
[00:41] Still ChatSpot.
[00:42] And I know that you've handed that off now
[00:43] to like a team actually that's working on this.
[00:45] It's not like just our mesh project anymore.
[00:48] So I don't know exactly where to go with this,
[00:50] but just why is AI so top of mind?
[00:53] And where do you think people should be spending time?
[00:56] Where do you think things are heading?
[00:58] What comes to mind around AI?
[01:00] Yeah, it's obviously I'm not alone in my excitement,
[01:04] but I will say this.
[01:05] So I've been,
[01:06] so I'm about to hit the 30 year anniversary of my working
[01:10] in like commercial software, right?
[01:12] Like that's so I've been at this for a long, long time
[01:14] and that's all I've ever known.
[01:15] That's all I've ever done.
[01:17] And the last time I was this both excited,
[01:23] I'll just excited because that was when the web first
[01:26] came along in the mid to late 90s.
[01:29] And I'm like, oh, like this literally like
[01:32] changed everything, right?
[01:32] It's like relevant to everything.
[01:33] It's like literally everything is going to be impacted
[01:36] by this thing called the internet.
[01:37] And I was in my early 20s, right?
[01:39] And I've been here for mobile.
[01:43] I've been here for social.
[01:44] I've seen lots of things that people got really excited
[01:47] about, but nothing to me has kind of hit the Richter scale
[01:52] to agree that AI does.
[01:53] And the reason is, okay,
[01:55] so if you think about early computers or PCs
[02:01] that kind of gave us compute at scale, which was awesome.
[02:05] The internet effectively gave us kind of distribution
[02:08] at scale, allowed us to take information,
[02:10] products, whatever and get them out at scale
[02:11] because everything was now connected where before it was not.
[02:15] What AI gives us now is cognition at scale,
[02:19] the ability to kind of literally amplify
[02:22] the human brain, right?
[02:23] Like that's never been done before.
[02:25] Not that we haven't been trying,
[02:26] but now we have demonstrable evidence
[02:29] and products that actually work.
[02:30] We've used chat to PT and products like it.
[02:34] And so it's life changing, right?
[02:36] And so for the product people out there,
[02:38] which is a lot of you, AI, so by the way,
[02:42] the internet unlocked a massive opportunity
[02:44] because especially for startups, right?
[02:47] It's like, oh, we can just reimagine the world
[02:49] with this new thing called the internet
[02:50] that was not possible a year ago
[02:52] and now is what can we kind of now unlock
[02:54] and lots of great companies that were created?
[02:57] I think something similar will happen here.
[02:59] And there's a couple of things that I think
[03:00] that are just tactically that I think are possible vectors
[03:04] that kind of satisfy my spreadsheet of
[03:06] if I were gonna choose ideas
[03:07] and the supplies across industries is that,
[03:11] so as software companies and product builders,
[03:13] most of us have always called our products
[03:17] like, oh, we build intuitive products.
[03:18] Where's that good?
[03:20] And we say that, right?
[03:23] And it turns out, it's just not true
[03:25] because as a user of X product, whatever happens to be,
[03:29] it's like, okay, I've got this mental model,
[03:31] the thing I'm trying to accomplish.
[03:33] And then I have to translate that
[03:34] into a series of clicks and drags and touches and swipes
[03:38] in order to accomplish the thing that I want
[03:40] in the software product that I'm using.
[03:41] And what varies is the degree
[03:43] to which that translation needs to occur.
[03:45] But there is this impedance mismatch, right?
[03:46] There's a translation that has to happen
[03:48] from the what's in my head,
[03:49] like, I wanna remove this background in Photoshop.
[03:51] I wanna create this report in HubSpot.
[03:54] And so the opportunity now is that
[03:57] we're going from what was an imperative model.
[04:00] This is what engineers would call like a step-by-step.
[04:02] You give instructions to the computer,
[04:04] like do this, do this, do this, do this.
[04:06] And then hopefully you get the outcome
[04:08] you're looking forward to
[04:09] what engineers would call a declarative model.
[04:11] A declarative model is you describe the outcome you want,
[04:14] not the steps to get there.
[04:15] And the closest analogy that most people are familiar with
[04:19] is SQL, the Korean language, right?
[04:21] So before SQL, if you wanted to get data out of a system,
[04:25] you wrote code that says, okay,
[04:26] loop over all my customer records
[04:27] and then filter out the ones
[04:28] that have less than a million dollars of revenue
[04:30] and then give me the result.
[04:32] And SQL said, no, just put a where clause
[04:35] on the describe the data you want
[04:36] and what columns you want
[04:38] and how do you wanna order it
[04:39] and what filters you wanna apply
[04:40] and it figures out, if the database figures out
[04:42] how to get you the thing that you're looking for.
[04:45] Now we have the ability to do that
[04:46] for interfaces, for software, right?
[04:48] So instead of saying click here, drag here,
[04:50] it's like, I want you to generate a report
[04:52] that's all my customers in Europe
[04:54] that we signed up last quarter
[04:55] that were more than 100K in ARR.
[04:58] And you just literally take the thing that's in your head
[05:00] and express it in whatever medium you choose,
[05:04] text, voice, doesn't matter.
[05:06] And the software now can actually,
[05:09] so now the technology exists to pull that off.
[05:11] Did not exist before and now it exists.
[05:13] I know it didn't exist before
[05:14] because six and a half years ago
[05:17] I built this product called GrowthBot.
[05:19] That was a chatbot for HubSpot software
[05:22] and business software,
[05:22] generally for marketing and sales people.
[05:23] It's essentially what ChatSpot is now.
[05:26] Amazing product, GrowthBot,
[05:28] and it had just one teeny tiny small problem
[05:32] which is it didn't work.
[05:35] Really well conceived, really like brilliant idea.
[05:38] It just didn't work
[05:39] and the technologies wasn't there, right?
[05:41] The use couldn't do it with any degree of fidelity
[05:43] because AI had, and now you can.
[05:46] And that's what kind of caused me to go,
[05:49] kind of prove out my theories
[05:50] like I had a chip on my shoulder,
[05:51] particularly with that idea, right?
[05:53] But I think, I'm not suggesting that,
[05:56] web and mobile interfaces are gonna go away
[05:59] but there are a class of use cases across
[06:01] pretty much all software
[06:03] where we can make things easier for the human
[06:06] by not forcing that translation layer
[06:08] and just make it truly intuitive.
[06:11] Yeah, so thank you for coming to my TED talk.
[06:14] I'm gonna have to get out of here.
