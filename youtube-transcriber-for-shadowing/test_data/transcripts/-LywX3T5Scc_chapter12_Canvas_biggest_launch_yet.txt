============================================================

[00:00] of us that gives a lot more meaning to our work than get rich.
[00:02] Okay. So speaking of product coming back to that, you guys are launching something.
[00:07] Maybe you've already launched it by the time this comes out.
[00:09] Uh, what I heard described as the, the, the biggest launching canvas history.
[00:14] No big deal.
[00:15] That's a high bar considering all things you guys have launched.
[00:17] What are you launching?
[00:18] Why is it such a big deal?
[00:20] So we are extraordinarily excited about what we are launching.
[00:23] We, I guess the whole mission of Canva is to empower the world to design.
[00:27] And so what has been enabled by new technology?
[00:29] With all of AI has been just really profound, enabled, enabling people to take
[00:34] their idea and turn it into design, a design and have as little friction
[00:37] between those two points.
[00:39] So we are doubling down radically on our video product and bring some incredible
[00:43] capabilities to our mobile and desktop platform.
[00:46] We are launching email, which has been one of our most hotly requested features.
[00:51] Um, from enterprise customers around the world and business customers around the
[00:54] world who want to be able to design with canvas drag and drop ease and to be able
[00:58] to create an email.
[00:59] We're launching forms.
[01:01] We are launching probably one of the most exciting things is the way we're
[01:05] embedding AI across the entire product suite.
[01:08] And so you can actually, um, use AI to design a presentation, a video, a, um,
[01:16] email, a website, all of these things can actually now be done inside the core editor
[01:21] inside the design tab, um, which is used by 170 million.
[01:26] Yeah.
[01:26] It's used 170 million times a month.
[01:29] And then on our elements tab, which has used 900 million times a month.
[01:33] Um, we are also embedding AI.
[01:36] So you can actually generate a video.
[01:38] You can generate a, um, canva code and you can generate photos all directly
[01:43] inside that platform.
[01:45] And then we're also launching comments as you, lots of use our customers use
[01:49] canva, um, to comment and collaborate.
[01:51] And now you can actually just tag at canva and you can collaborate.
[01:55] Um, you can just say, Hey, like, can you make this title shorter?
[01:58] Can you do this?
[01:58] Can you do that?
[01:59] And it has all of the context of the design.
[02:01] So in situ, you can actually just have a collaborator that can help get your work
[02:04] done.
[02:05] So we are pretty excited about all of this.
[02:08] Amazing.
[02:09] I have something I'm going to just let people know.
[02:10] I don't know if people know all this, how many products you all have now.
[02:14] I think a lot of people think of canva as like a design graphics for, you know,
[02:18] social media and marketing and things like that.
[02:20] But you also have spreadsheets, docs, whiteboards, charts, uh, code, AI coding
[02:25] tool.
[02:26] And now, uh, what I'm hearing is email forms.
[02:29] That's probably a few other things I'm not.
[02:31] Yeah.
[02:31] Truly design anything where we're literally living up to that.
[02:34] Like a hundred million people.
[02:36] I design a presentation in Canva each month now.
[02:39] And it's, it's pretty fascinating to see that when you speak to, I saw a tweet
[02:43] some time ago that we're talking about how it's a generational thing that a
[02:47] certain generation uses Microsoft, a certain generation uses Google.
[02:51] And then it was Gen Z, like presentations have become, um, the way they
[02:56] design a presentation is in Canva.
[02:58] Um, but it's not just generational for those other, other generational ilk.
[03:03] All right.
[03:03] But it's, it's been fascinating to see.
