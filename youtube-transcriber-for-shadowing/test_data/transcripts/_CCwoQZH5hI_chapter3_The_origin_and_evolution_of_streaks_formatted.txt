============================================================

Okay, let's talk about how this feature originally came to be. What was the original version of it? What was the original insight that led to it? The oldest streaks are as old as Duolingo itself. When we launched Duolingo, we launched with the streak feature. I say "we," but I was just graduating undergrad when Duolingo launched, so this was well before my time. The initial way the feature worked was that you'd come to Duolingo and set a goal for yourself, which was based on experience points, or XP. 

Duolingo has an experience point-based system that drives a lot of our features in the app. You would set a goal based on your language learning objectives, maybe a 10 XP goal versus a 50 XP goal. Extending your streak meant hitting that XP goal. This worked well and speaks to how Duolingo initially grew. Luis launched it with a TED talk, and we probably had a more tech-forward user base at the start. The idea of an XP-based streak system made sense in that context. However, it also meant that users could come in, do multiple lessons a day, set too hard of a goal, and then lose their streak, which is probably not ideal.

The nice thing about how we initially set it up was that it connected with your goals. If you were serious about learning a language, we tracked how well you were doing. One of the most impactful experiments we ran was to shift from an XP-based streak to simply doing one lesson a day to extend your streak. The risk was that users might care less about it since it wasn't connected to their goals, but we saw none of that. This change was a huge driver of daily active users, making it easier to extend your streak while still being meaningful.

As we think about building a streak, it's important to consider the unit of use for your app. For Duolingo, that unit is doing a lesson. If our goal is to have users come back every day and engage with the app, then focusing the streak on just one lesson instead of multiple doesn't hurt us. This was a significant change, moving from an XP-based streak to a one-lesson streak. It's also simple, which is essential. As a product manager, it's easy to have a million goals for a feature and build something complex, but a one-lesson streak is easy for users to understand.

Just to clarify for folks who aren't super familiar with XP, it's basically experience points you earn from doing activities on Duolingo. Based on what you do and how well you do it, we award you experience points. This drives several features in our app, including leaderboards, where you compete with others over the week. However, the streak is no longer one of those features.

I want to talk about the journey from that point to what it is today, but first, a quick tangent. I saw Luis tweet just this week that someone asked him how he decides whether to optimize for learning or engagement. He responded that everything we do is focused on engagement because you won't learn anything if you're not coming back to the app. As an engagement PM, that was the coolest thing he could have said.

From my perspective, I see myself as both a learning PM and an engagement PM. The easiest way not to learn on Duolingo is not to come back the next day. If we don't make the app engaging, you won't have the opportunity to interact with our learning features. However, there is a long tail of learning; if we simplify the experience too much, users won't actually learn and won't care. Streaks work best when they are built on top of an app that users care about.

We track a lot of this with the work we do, ensuring that as we make changes to the streak, we are not hurting the learning experience. We don't have a ton of interaction with it, but we're constantly thinking about this balance. Thank you, Luis, for articulating that. It makes sense to me.
