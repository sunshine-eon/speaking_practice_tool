[00:00] or bucket monetary frictions.
[00:02] So let's follow this thread of metrics.
[00:04] You're big on absolute numbers.
[00:08] And you've been talking about this already
[00:09] versus like percentages and ratios.
[00:11] Talk about that and how you encourage your teams
[00:13] to think about metrics.
[00:15] Yeah, I think one of the things that I think happens
[00:17] particularly in a large,
[00:17] in Shopify's growth, there's about 600 folks,
[00:19] like when you have teams naturally break up the world
[00:23] into different funnel stages or different points
[00:27] in the journey, it gets very seductive.
[00:30] Just look at my part of the funnel
[00:33] and what's my conversion rate through that part of the funnel?
[00:37] Right, and then the team starts to optimize
[00:39] for that conversion rate as their North Star
[00:42] over a longer time period.
[00:44] I'm gonna try to move my conversion rate from 10
[00:46] to 12% or what have you.
[00:49] But in practice, you know, talked about like,
[00:53] it's actually almost always easier to just make it harder
[00:56] to do the thing right before your step in the funnel
[01:00] to increase your conversion rate.
[01:01] If I make it harder to sign up,
[01:03] it's gonna be very easy to increase sign up
[01:05] to activated rate because I just have fewer people
[01:07] and the people who made it through are higher intent.
[01:09] And so I see teams get really stuck when they,
[01:13] like are trying to optimize conversion rate,
[01:15] but they just make it harder to do the previous thing
[01:18] versus everyone is thinking about absolute number
[01:22] of people who made it through their quote stage of the funnel.
[01:27] So instead of I'm trying to convert a bunch of people,
[01:31] a conversion rate, I just want more people to get activated.
[01:34] And then once you start thinking that way,
[01:35] you realize actually the best way to get more people
[01:38] to get to a step is sometimes
[01:40] and often it's just get more people
[01:44] in the door in the first place.
[01:46] So make it easier to sign up
[01:47] or reduce friction, it's the opposite, right?
[01:50] And so like, that will always hurt your conversion rate,
[01:53] but it may actually give you more people on the outside.
[01:57] And a lot of teams, if you're very nervous,
[01:59] their retention rate went down, their LTV went down,
[02:01] oh my goodness, this is gonna affect our ability to pay.
[02:04] No, your CAC also went down by probably more.
[02:08] And so now you have the ability to likely spend more
[02:12] and you have more people through the door
[02:14] getting to each point in the activation
[02:16] or the immersion journeys.
[02:19] What I'm hearing is essentially teams are gold,
[02:20] not on increase, lift this conversion step by some percentage.
[02:25] It's drive some incremental absolute number
[02:28] of new merchants potential.
[02:31] Merchants, exactly.
