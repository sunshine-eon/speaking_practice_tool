============================================================

[00:00] Your podcast is a podcast by a builder for other builders.
[00:04] Here's the most interesting question I think people can ask builders.
[00:08] What is your energy source?
[00:10] My energy source is dissatisfaction with status quo.
[00:13] Like, oh, so many books are about this technology leading to dystopia.
[00:16] Like, no one who really thinks about this would want to be born into the world 20 years before today.
[00:21] I think today is the dystopia of the future.
[00:24] It behooves us to try to build the kinds of problems that lead towards progress.
[00:28] There's a couple quotes along these lines I've seen that describe the way you think about this stuff.
[00:31] If most people are doing it a certain way, I by default don't want to do it that way.
[00:34] There's an aesthetic in the world that exists, which is that business people dress in suit and tie.
[00:40] They are speaking much more sophisticated than I do, usually without an accent.
[00:44] They usually have a stick and show dramatically at the chart that is behind them.
[00:48] How much is that aesthetic overlapped with outperformance?
[00:52] Passimism sounds extremely sophisticated.
[00:55] Optimism always sounds dumb or at least naïve.
[00:58] The most powerful, unquantifiable things in the world of business are fun and delight.
[01:04] I don't know of any other company that operates where the founder has this 100-year vision
[01:08] of where the product needs to go and working backwards from that.
[01:11] I talk about look in the future and then think backwards a lot, right?
[01:15] Like, it's like, what would we want to have done 20 years ago on this?
[01:19] We have very long-term plans.
[01:21] At 100 years, you can't talk about this sort of software project,
[01:24] but you can't talk about the mission itself.
[01:26] Whatever things that will survive for 80 years that are left on this particular time frame,
[01:31] like entrepreneurship is just precious.
[01:32] Shopify exists basically to make entrepreneurship more common.
[01:35] Is there anything you want to leave listeners with?
[01:37] I really, really, really think that there is not a single person on this planet
[01:41] who is even close to being at their maximum potential.
[01:45] Reminding people of their own potential constantly is actually a wonderful thing to do.
[01:51] Today, my guest is Toby Letka.
[01:56] Toby is a man who needs no introduction, so I'm going to keep this very short
[02:00] and get you right to this jam-packed conversation.

[02:15] This episode is brought to you by Cinch, the customer communications cloud.
[02:20] Here's the thing about digital customer communications.
[02:23] Whether you're sending marketing campaigns, verification codes, or account alerts,
[02:27] you need them to reach users reliably.
[02:29] That's where Cinch comes in.
[02:31] Over 150,000 businesses, including eight of the top 10 largest tech companies globally,
[02:37] use Cinch's API to build messaging, email, and calling into their products.
[02:41] And there's something big happening in messaging that product teams need to know about.
[02:45] Rich Communication Services, or RCS.
[02:49] Think of RCS as SMS 2.0.
[02:51] Instead of getting text from a random number,
[02:53] your users will see your verified company name and logo without needing to download anything new.
[02:58] It's a more secure and branded experience.
[03:01] Plus, you get features like interactive carousels and suggested replies.
[03:05] And here's why this matters.
[03:07] U.S. carriers are starting to adopt RCS.
[03:10] Cinch is already helping major brands send RCS messages around the world.
[03:14] And they're helping Lenny's podcast listeners get registered first,
[03:17] before the rush hits the U.S. market.
