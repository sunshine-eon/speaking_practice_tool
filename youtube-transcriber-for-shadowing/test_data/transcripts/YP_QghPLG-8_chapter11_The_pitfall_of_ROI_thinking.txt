============================================================

[00:00] I love that visual of a bandaid falling off.
[00:01] That's what we've all seen that.
[00:03] This is a good segue to our fifth and final big idea,
[00:06] maybe the most mind bending of all your ideas that I want to talk about.
[00:11] And it's about prioritization.
[00:13] And you make this really interesting point that instead of thinking about
[00:17] the highest ROI work you should be doing, which is how I've always thought
[00:20] about it, how I think most PMs think about prioritization.
[00:24] Your point is you should think about it from a minimizing opportunity
[00:28] cost perspective versus ROI perspective.
[00:31] And so I'm excited to hear your take on this and where this idea came from.
[00:35] Yeah, I think I learned this by kind of just observing Patrick at Stripe,
[00:41] particularly over the last couple of years that I was there.
[00:44] And then I kind of like encapsulated what I learned and observed in this
[00:50] tweet, which is when you are in a high leverage role, you should stop
[00:56] doing work that simply provides a positive return on investment, ROI.
[01:03] And you should start focusing on work that minimizes opportunity cost.
[01:08] And what drives that is the observation that in a high leverage role,
[01:12] so like product management is a good example of a high leverage role.
[01:18] Founders by definition are in a high leverage role.
[01:21] Engineering leaders, design leaders, designers, like these are all fairly
[01:26] high leverage roles.
[01:28] And in a high leverage role, there will be hundreds of things that you can do
[01:32] that will provide a positive ROI.
[01:34] Right.
[01:35] And what is positive ROI?
[01:36] It's simply that the value created is greater than the value of your time.
[01:44] Right.
[01:44] That essentially will ensure positive ROI, right?
[01:48] More than zero.
[01:49] So the problem is you should not be doing most of these things.
[01:54] And the reason this kind of ROI mindset is suboptimal and perhaps even
[01:59] harmful in high leverage roles is, you know, the formula for ROI is value
[02:05] created minus cost of your time divided by the cost of your time.
[02:10] So the cost of your time is in the denominator.
[02:13] Right.
[02:13] And just for the sake of simplicity, let's just call it time, time taken.
[02:17] Right.
[02:18] So when the time taken to do something is in the denominator and whether it's
[02:23] at an individual level or at a team level, what we end up doing to get high ROI on
[02:29] our work is we end up trying to decrease the denominator.
[02:35] So, you know, when it's a ratio and you increase, decrease the denominator,
[02:40] the value of the ratio grows.
[02:42] Right.
[02:42] And so, so how do you decrease the denominator in this case?
[02:46] Where time is the denominator is you start working on things that take less time.
[02:51] Right.
[02:52] So, so you start like working on the low hanging fruit.
[02:55] You start prioritizing the quick wins.
[02:58] Right.
[02:58] And the quick wins are very popular.
[02:59] Right.
[03:00] Like any team meeting or sprint meeting.
[03:01] Oh, that's a quick one.
[03:02] Yeah, let's do it.
[03:03] Right.
[03:04] And I don't have anything against quick wins.
[03:07] The problem is we just fill up our plate with quick wins.
[03:11] And while that may be fine in most cases in most situations in high leverage roles,
[03:17] you miss the upside and you miss the opportunity that you could have gained
[03:23] by focusing on other things.
[03:27] Right.
[03:27] Like let's take opportunity costs now.
[03:29] What is the like, how do you calculate opportunity costs?
[03:32] Opportunity cost is simply the value of the optimal option minus the value
[03:37] of the chosen option.
[03:39] Right.
[03:39] So the difference between what could have been the optimal option to pick
[03:43] and the option you did pick is the opportunity cost.
[03:47] Right.
[03:47] So you need to minimize the opportunity cost, meaning you need to be working
[03:51] on the optimal things.
[03:53] Right.
[03:54] So when we reprogram ourselves to think in terms of opportunity cost, we are no
[03:58] longer thinking, Oh, is this a good use of my time?
[04:02] Right.
[04:02] Instead, you are thinking, is this the best use of my time?
[04:06] And it's a subtle, but profound shift.
[04:09] In our thinking, because when we think about opportunity cost, we will pick
[04:15] certain things that we would have never picked if we just had it the ROI mindset.
[04:20] And again, this applies equally at the level of individuals of the work we decide
[04:26] to do as individuals on a day to day basis and the work we do with our teams,
[04:30] the things we prioritize.
[04:32] So that's sort of the basis of this statement that like you should try to
[04:37] minimize opportunity cost and focus on those things rather than simply
[04:41] chasing positive ROI.
[04:44] Is there an example that that comes to mind of when you did this or maybe did
[04:47] it the wrong way that kind of helped inspire this idea?
[04:50] Or is this just kind of more of a broad lesson that you've learned over time?
[04:54] Oh, I mean, I saw that all the time in the work I did at pretty much every company.
[05:02] And again, I've been guilty of this myself.
[05:04] Where I think that typically, you know, the type of situation where I have
[05:11] seen this as an example is you are trying to prioritize the next quarter, right?
[05:18] There are five sure things you can do that will have a small to medium impact.
[05:25] And it's very clear.
[05:27] And then there are two ambiguous things that you could do.
[05:34] That perhaps deep down, you know, you should pursue them, but you don't end up
[05:39] picking them because it's again, you're satisfying yourself by observing, oh,
[05:46] each of these is positive ROI, right?
[05:49] Each of these five things that we can do that are very well defined as positive ROI.
[05:54] And so you don't touch those two things.
[05:56] Now it could be that one of those things could meaningfully change the
[06:02] trajectory of your business.
[06:04] Right.
[06:05] And kind of, but doing that requires more work to figure that out, to flesh it out.
[06:14] But we convince ourselves that positive ROI is great.
[06:18] Right.
[06:18] And so we make ourselves busy.
[06:20] And this is what I have seen myself do.
[06:23] I've seen other teams do.
[06:25] And certainly, like when I sit down with PMs often or even founders, I find that
[06:31] there is this gravitation towards these types of tasks, which are simply providing
[06:35] positive ROI.
[06:37] So it shows up most often in our planning, essentially.
[06:41] And again, I'm not against things that are quick wins or things that
[06:45] provide positive ROI, but I always want to check what are some big opportunities
[06:52] that we are not paying attention to by default.
[06:55] And under what scenarios can we start chasing that?
[07:00] When I started working on Stripe Connect, which is a major, major product for
[07:05] Stripe and a large business for Stripe.
[07:07] There was a time when I noticed when I just started working on it, I noticed
[07:11] the team was working on a lot of positive ROI things.
[07:13] And I came in and it kind of like just simply instigated that like, Hey, how
[07:17] about we work on this, this big scary project?
[07:22] Because I was hearing from customers that there is some need and that I had the
[07:26] instinct that this need is going to grow in over time of being able to sort of,
[07:31] you know, manage marketplace payments in a more flexible way.
[07:35] And, you know, we wouldn't have looked at it if we were just focused on positive ROI.
[07:40] But as we started looking at it, we realized, Oh, yes, this is a huge opportunity.
[07:44] And we were able to then pursue it because we were sort of shifting the
[07:48] mindset from just positive ROI to minimizing opportunity cost.
