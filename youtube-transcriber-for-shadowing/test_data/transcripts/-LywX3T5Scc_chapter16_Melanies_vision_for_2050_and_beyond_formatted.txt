============================================================

Yeah, I like it. This is reminding me of, you mentioned earlier in our conversation, you have this vision board that you set for 2050, is that right? 

Yeah, that's right. Can you share something from that vision board? I'll tell you why the vision board came about. Because it's only been in recent months, I did feel like as humanity we are on a bit of a freight train. That freight train is, I think, if we take a lot of visions for a lot of different companies and a lot of things that are happening, and you just fast forward 50 years or to 2050 and you say, are we in a safer world? Is the world the place that we want our kids to grow up in? Is this the humanity that we want? 

I didn't feel that the train that we are headed on always feels great. In fact, it scared me quite greatly for a whole host of reasons. So, I sat with that feeling for a little and then I kind of got to work on my 2050 walls. Back to the chaos to clarity, the first thing was riding my 2050 wall. I've kind of really been loving it. On the 2050 wall, I started with a lot of quotes. Everything good was once imagined and many other quotes are along those similar lines. 

Rather than just being fearful of the things that I'm worried about for society and for humanity, I started to think, what would the alternative be? What is that vision that I would love to see us have? Basic human needs for all. Global education being a basic human right that everyone experiences. All the really important things that we want as humanity. 

Again, like using vision and using imagination and just dreaming about the future. I find it really fascinating in my day-to-day back, literally having it beside me as I work every day. The little tiny decisions that can kind of help to angle towards that future that we want. Can I help will any of that into existence? I honestly don't know. But I feel like just by starting to write it down, some little brainstorm exercise with a number of other people, and starting to just etch out how do we get closer and closer to that? 

On my vision of the future, it's community. It's the whole of humanity trying to dream bigger and to dream bigger goals and then us actually rising to that occasion. In the world we don't want, I think loneliness is right. Purpose is gone. What we teach people in schools is pointless. In my vision for 2050, it's none of those things. Communities are bound to fall. We all have deep purpose. That deep purpose springs from having bigger dreams that we collectively go out and achieve. 

With something that we're doing at our Canva World tour keynote in two weeks' time, which I think is going to be after this is released, we've been asking people what is one goal you'd like to see the world achieve in our lifetime? People literally writing it down, I think is pretty powerful. Then people sharing that with other people, I think is pretty powerful. And then us actually figuring out how the hell do we turn that reality that we all deeply desperately want into existence? 

I think is genuinely one of the biggest questions of our time. But then again, rather than trying to tackle that entire thing by yourself, how do you take that first tiny step that starts to see that in your own life, in your own family, in your own community? I think that's where we'll get purpose from. I think that is one of the key answers to loneliness: actually working towards something bigger than yourself. 

Wow, I really appreciate you sharing all that. I was thinking as you were talking, just considering how wildly successful Canva has been and just how ambitious that was when you started. I would not be at all surprised if this actually happens in the future, this very difficult vision. 

It's not something that I alone can achieve. I think it has to be obviously a global collective effort because there's zero chance I can go and achieve basic human needs for all. But I think that I'd like to change that. I'd like to help change the mood. I'd like to help change the way we're thinking about things. 

I genuinely think there's a little, we need to move course a little and decide not what are all the things that we kind of like, what's the freight train we're currently on, but what is it that we actually want? What do we want our societies to look like? What do we want the world to look like? Is it good enough that there are hundreds of millions of people that can't eat? What the hell? It just literally makes no sense. A column B world, you might say. Absolutely.
