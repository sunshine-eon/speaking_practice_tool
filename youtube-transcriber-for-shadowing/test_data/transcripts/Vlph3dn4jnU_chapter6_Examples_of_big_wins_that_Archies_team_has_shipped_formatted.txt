============================================================

While we're in the topic of experiments and what you've done, I'm curious if there are any examples of big wins that your team has shipped that might inspire people as they're thinking about launching experiments. I know there's probably some trade secret stuff you don't want competitors to know. This is particular to Shopify and a platform in e-commerce, but is there anything worth sharing, like a huge win that maybe we didn't expect?

Going back, there's always a lot of value in thinking through monetary friction. As I mentioned, that's always going to be something to explore—trial dynamics, different types of incentives. All of those things are very impactful. I would say, on things that are maybe more practical and for everyone, there's an enormous amount. We do see these with long-term effects, but just the nuts and bolts of sign-up, collecting the right information, and you usually want to collect more information than most people think you do in your sign-up flow.

If you can leverage that to personalize the guidance—this is the first to ask product—the guidance that someone can get when they onboard into Shopify is crucial. Whether you're coming on for in-person selling, online selling, or different channels, the nuts and bolts are to get more information from folks, build trust, and give them the right amount of guidance in a personalized way. That may sound obvious, but the impact of just nailing those flows has never ceased to amaze me in setting up that person for long-term success. So, there's monetary friction, and then just really good onboarding and personalization—a well of opportunities there.

I love that onboarding comes up every time I ask anyone where they've seen ongoing success and opportunities, particularly in driving retention. It's interesting that that's not what you typically look at, but it turns out to be one of the biggest levers for increasing retention. Even for a company that doesn't focus on retention, that's a big opportunity.

Yes, it really is. In Shopify's case, the big thing about all of our metrics is that we get very nervous about the easiest way to increase retention. It's always to constrict the funnel stage one above the retention metric you're trying to optimize for. The simplest way to increase my sign-up to activate a thing is just to make it harder to sign up. Nuts and bolts, that will always happen when you have teams focused on local conversion rates. You get all these weird team incentives because they're optimizing to implicitly make it harder to do the step before them.

Because we focus on that long-term GMV number of merchants who are successful, orienting every team to think about the total number of people—not the rate, but the total number of people who got to the end of their part of the journey—is a very powerful way to incentivize people to do the right thing in terms of getting people set up. This approach counters the tendency to constrict the funnel step right before them to make their local conversion rate look better, which is the bane of my existence. I see a lot of teams implicitly or explicitly do this when they get too focused on rates as a way to think about the world.

Incentives—what a power, what a lever. I definitely want to chat a little bit more about metrics. You have a really interesting take that's kind of built on what you're just talking about, but first of all...
