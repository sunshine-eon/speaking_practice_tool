============================================================

Let's talk about hiring then. Is there anything unique about how you approach hiring, sourcing, looking for people, and what you look for in individuals that you think might contribute to your alumni being so successful down the road? I think everyone is striving for talented, skillful, smart, and experienced people. However, value is way more about raw intellect and this unquenched hunger to build things rather than just experience.

Let me bring an example. Imagine you hire a great experienced professional with an impressive record of achievements. What I see in product roles is that the adoption curve is usually longer than in other functions. Product owners, by definition, are the experts in their domain and know the intricacies of how a product is built and how it's used. These professionals often take a lot of time to ramp up, and sometimes they struggle to adapt to a new culture. Worse, they may rest on their laurels. With super inflated expectations and usually high compensation, this can lead to disappointment.

After conducting maybe four or five hundred interviews with product owners at Revolut, I've observed that professionals with many years of experience from established companies often lack a strong urge to change the status quo. This change requires total dedication and effort. Therefore, even if a candidate doesn't have a lot of years of experience, if they love building things and have worked with engineers—perhaps in their own startup—this can be a strong indicator of potential. One of the best profiles I've seen is a tech co-founder.

I believe that working in a startup, building things yourself or with a very small team, and being involved in different areas is probably the best way to boost a career. These kinds of people thrive at Revolut. Even if they don't have extensive experience, they are quick to identify specific problems, understand customer pain points, and move swiftly to solve them. This proactive approach earns them respect from their peers, as they tackle one problem after another, leading to their growth within the company.

Essentially, what I'm hearing is that you hire more junior, highly intelligent, driven, and passionate individuals. This explains why so many people get promoted quickly at Revolut. They start earlier in their careers, and you help them learn essential skills like ownership, depth, understanding complex environments, and building amazing products. This all makes a lot of sense.

Is there anything you've figured out about where to find these people? This is the dream: to hire incredibly smart, driven individuals that nobody knows about yet and then help them become exceptional. Have you discovered any effective sourcing strategies for finding these folks?

The way we work involves weekly catch-ups with the recruitment team. Essentially, they operate in sprints, and during each sprint, we define our focus areas and target companies. One great source is looking into products and teams that we admire. If someone has built a great product, they are likely a high performer. We provide the sourcing team with a list of important products in specific areas, and they target those companies for potential candidates.

It could also involve different areas, including schools—like good universities. It varies from sprint to sprint. That makes sense. Gokul had this really good piece of advice, which I think was on the podcast or maybe he tweeted about it. He mentioned looking at successful companies and identifying which function in that company is key to their success. So, you might look to Company A for sales, Company B for customer support, and Company C for design. It sounds like that's somewhat aligned with how you guys think about it.

Very cool. I love how we're uncovering this mystery.
