============================================================

[51:55] and you do have to make sure you can keep doing it.
[51:57] Yeah, that's actually a great segue to where I was going to go next,
[51:59] which is you say you build and you like to build stuff,
[52:02] but you're like legitimately building a lot of stuff.
[52:06] So you have the site, mindofharry.com,
[52:08] where you share all these side projects.
[52:10] So can you just talk about what's going on there and some of this?
[52:12] Yeah, you built, you know, I am people.
[52:15] The only thing I've ever been good in my life is just building things
[52:18] and creating things.
[52:18] And I get a lot of energy from it.
[52:21] And yeah, I have a site that's called mindofharry,
[52:23] because it is really whatever is top of mind.
[52:25] I try to do my best to completely separate it from business.
[52:27] I know there's always a draw is a good PM to kind of say,
[52:30] is there a business here?
[52:31] But I try to keep it as art, just, you know, like it's completely art.
[52:34] And it's what I want to build.
[52:35] And I take on new subjects and I have two little kids and, you know,
[52:39] it's it's fun to kind of one of them was a book.
[52:42] Me and my oldest wrote and it was kind of a set of bedtime stories.
[52:46] We did. And then one day I was like, Hey, we should just make this a notebook.
[52:48] And we didn't. I think it's got about half a million readers now.
[52:51] So it's, you know, it's it's it's it's been fun to kind of see it,
[52:55] you know, take some life and go through.
[52:57] We made a board game recently that I know, Stanford Design School
[53:00] or some professors there have been using.
[53:01] And it was called Parallel Universe.
[53:03] And it's how do you kind of kind of have a card and then be able to see,
[53:07] like, you know, maybe the card says there's no windows in this world anymore.
[53:10] And then what would happen in that world?
[53:12] You got to list 10 different things that would happen.
[53:14] So kind of that ability to kind of think ahead and kind of fund scyphes.
[53:18] I make kind of healthy gummy bears.
[53:20] I just try to take something completely new and have that.
[53:23] I don't know. It's probably one of the more fun moments in this world
[53:26] where you can sit there and just create something and have some new clay.
[53:29] And yeah, it's that that is what that website is about.
[53:34] Wait, so you made actual gummy bears?
[53:35] Yeah, we are doing some with gummy bears.
[53:37] So, Lenny, I know you're expecting a new additional bit in congratulations again.
[53:41] Well, one of the things I found when I had kids is no matter what I was trying to do,
[53:45] there was like candy and sugar everywhere, like any Halloween and birthday party, etc.
[53:49] So I wanted to create you can't get rid of it because like, you know, it was just hard to do.
[53:54] So I, you know, we were like, hey, we're going to sit down and make our own gummy bear.
[53:57] What I found is this is just a fun tidbit for your readers.
[53:59] You open like a Twizzler, one of those about 80 percent of what's in there is sugar
[54:03] because they're optimizing for shelf life, right?
[54:05] They're optimizing what's in the store.
[54:07] And so what we were able to do is basically create a gummy bear, about 40 percent of its sugar.
[54:11] It's just got five ingredients.
[54:12] Honey is the sweetener because I don't want to give my kids some alternative sweeteners.
[54:15] But yeah, we have a small commercial kitchen and we produce some gummy bears.
[54:19] And if you ever want to try them to any of my to any of your followers,
[54:22] I'm happy to send some gummy bears and hopefully you can you can check them out.
[54:26] We had a people is there a way to buy them somewhere?
[54:29] We can go to Mind of Hari.
[54:30] We stock them seasonally.
[54:31] And there is one of the things that we found out is there is different kind of laws on how
[54:37] it can be shipped and obviously we're not optimizing for long storage.
[54:40] So but they'll be on Mind of Hari and you can always reach out to me and I'll find you and
[54:44] tell you where which farmers market we're at or whatever and you can come swing by.
[54:48] Well, I don't see it on Mind of Hari.
[54:50] So maybe by the time this comes out, put it on here or if you're trying to put it on there.
[54:53] Yeah, it's under it's on the homepage.
[54:55] And then when they're stuck, we put them in the shop.
[54:57] OK, so that means they're out of stock.
[54:58] All right, we're going to sell you out.
[54:59] Let's get all your gummy bears.
