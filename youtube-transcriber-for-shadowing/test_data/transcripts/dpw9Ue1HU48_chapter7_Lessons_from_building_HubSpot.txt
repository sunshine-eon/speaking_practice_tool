============================================================

[00:00] Okay, so you talked about you're a startup guy. At the same time, HubSpot is approaching its
[00:05] 10 years of being a public company, and I think 18 years since founding. I'm curious what lessons
[00:13] you've taken from that experience being someone that's clearly startup-y person, being an exec
[00:19] at a very fast growing and large company. And I'm thinking from the perspective of a founder
[00:24] who's maybe thinking about starting company or starting company, what advice you might have
[00:28] to share for them, and also for people in the exec role today? A couple of things. One, since we
[00:34] are publicly traded down, this doesn't get talked about enough. I'm going to go and get this out there,
[00:39] use this as a platform to get this message out, which is I think too many founders,
[00:45] they are very apprehensive of going public and going through the IPO process and being a publicly
[00:50] traded company because they think, I mean, that's at the beginning of the end. It's going
[00:54] to change everything, and my life is going to suck. And I think they're over indexing on what they
[00:58] think it's like to be a publicly traded company. In my own personal experience, and Brian, my co-founder
[01:04] would attest to this, and yes, there's certainly a tax or things we have to do now as a publicly
[01:07] traded company that we didn't have to do as a privately traded company. But there are actually
[01:12] benefits. For instance, if you're kind of venture back in private, let's say, you're
[01:16] sort of at a little bit the width of the market and how VCs perceive your category and all
[01:21] these things or whatever. And you get every now and then when you're out raising a round of capital,
[01:26] you sort of get marked to market. Now here's sort of what the valuation is based on what someone's
[01:30] willing to fund the company at. One of the nicest things, and this is underappreciated,
[01:35] is that we know right now what the market values HubSpot at. I can tell you that any
[01:40] business day of the week. And there's a niceness to that. And this is the other
[01:45] thing I kind of tell folks within the company is that the valuation, which is we're in a
[01:52] relatively efficient market. Like the public stock market is a relatively efficient by the
[01:56] economic definition of the term in efficient market. And so the valuation will oscillate
[02:01] around the value. So if you kind of focus on creating values, like here's what we're actually
[02:05] building. Valuation will sometimes be higher than you deserve, sometimes will be lower than
[02:09] you deserve. But over the fullness of time, those two things will kind of move in
[02:13] a lot step, right? That's been demonstrated. And that's what happens. That's almost a definition
[02:16] of an efficient market, is that information kind of moves essentially and then the valuation
[02:20] catches up with the actual value. But here's the other kind of social reason why I think
[02:26] founders should go public, which is so HubSpot, and I hadn't thought about this. So I'm not
[02:31] going to take credit for being this kind of generous, magnanimous person, is that in our
[02:37] first pre-public years, I think we were eight years old when we went public, we had created
[02:42] roughly a billion dollars in market cap give or take. We hadn't been a unicorn. So it was slightly
[02:46] below when we went public. So HubSpot was never a unicorn because that's privately held company
[02:52] over a billion. In the subsequent years, we went from a billion dollars in market cap
[02:56] to 30 billion, which is roughly what it is now. That first billion of market cap creation,
[03:02] a very small number of people got to participate in. The rest of the 29 billion dollars in market cap,
[03:08] everyone, every public investor got a chance to participate in. And so I like the idea of,
[03:14] okay, while you believe in your company, there's lots of people that believed in HubSpot,
[03:20] it's nice to let them kind of participate. Our customers, our partners, our well-wishers,
[03:24] and they can sort of now have the upside. And you don't get that in the private markets
[03:27] because it's a very closed, you can't just buy shares in every private company you like. I wish
[03:34] that existed, but it doesn't. So it's a way to let the market at large participate in your growth
[03:40] earlier.
