I want to talk about a new thing that I want to say yes to. I love the way your mind works, and I'm excited to discuss culture and how this connects to the way you think about it through various frameworks and lenses. Before we dive into that, you hinted at an interesting idea regarding how you pick what to work on. I know you have a unique framework for deciding which ideas are worth investing in, both as a founder and a product leader. How do you approach deciding what is worth your investment?

Imagine the Excel spreadsheet again. Let’s say you’re evaluating an idea for a startup, a new product, or a new feature. The first thing you should look at is potential. I measure things on a scale of 0 to 10 because I prefer quantifiable metrics. I need to be able to multiply x by y; I don’t like letter grades. So, put a number on it. For instance, if you’re considering starting a new business, think about what the potential outcome could be if it were successful. This could be measured in terms of impact, revenue, market cap, or personal fulfillment. It doesn’t matter what it is, but it’s important to assess the potential.

The second thing to consider is the probability of success. Here’s a common mistake people make: they often think through the probability first without considering the potential. What happens is they apply a filter that says, “I only have a one in ten chance to pull this off, so I’m not going to do it.” However, if it’s a one in ten chance at a $10 billion outcome, it might still be worth pursuing. Sometimes, it depends on your stage of life and how much risk you can afford to take. 

When I talk about probability, it can be approached in multiple ways. You can assign a percentage chance or use statistical methods like an event tree to evaluate different paths and their outcomes. For instance, if you have a 50/50 chance of making $10 million, the expected value is $5 million. If you have a 10% chance at a $100 million outcome, you should consider that option, even if the chances are lower, because the expected value is higher.

So, start with the potential outcome, then look at the probability—not the other way around. This helps you avoid prematurely discarding ideas that might actually be worth pursuing. The third factor is what I think of as either passion or proximity. Do you care about this idea? Can you bring something to it? The fourth factor is prowess. Do you have unique assets or advantages that position you well for success? This might include existing resources, market access, or specific expertise that enhances your probability of success.

It’s important to consider all these factors together. No single factor will dictate your decision. You need to assess how big the potential could be, what the chances of success are, how much you care about solving the problem, and whether this is something you can commit to for the long haul. Finally, ask yourself, “Why me? Why my company? Why would we succeed at this when others might not?”

I can already picture the spreadsheet. For every idea, you would have columns for potential, probability of success, passion, and prowess. I started with passion, but I have an issue with that word because it can be ambiguous. In startup circles, we often hear, “Pursue your passion.” However, many successful companies today were not founded by people who initially pursued their passion. They identified a significant opportunity and became passionate about it as they worked on it.

For example, one of my favorite startups I invested in is called Zip, a procurement platform. The founders were not passionate about procurement when they entered the space; they saw a huge opportunity and believed they could build a better product. They developed a passion for it as they engaged with the work. So, while it’s ideal to find your true calling, that’s a small fraction of people. Many first-time founders may not even know what their passion is yet. 

So, for anyone creating a spreadsheet for their startup ideas, remember to include potential, probability of success, passion, and prowess.
