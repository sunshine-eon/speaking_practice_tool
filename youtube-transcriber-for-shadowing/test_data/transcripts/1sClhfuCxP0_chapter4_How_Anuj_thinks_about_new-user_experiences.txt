============================================================

[00:00] Wow, fascinating. I could keep going, but I want to talk product.
[00:05] I've collected a bunch of questions from people that know you or people that have worked with you,
[00:09] all about a bunch of different stuff, so I'm just going to kind of go a little bit all over the place.
[00:13] And the first area I wanted to talk about is the new user experience.
[00:17] Apparently you have an interesting insight and kind of a different approach of thinking about new users and new user experiences.
[00:23] One of the things that I realized once we started working about the products is that product managers and generally companies
[00:29] are too engrossed in thinking about, because they're very close to the product, it's close to their heart,
[00:33] and they're looking at it all the time.
[00:35] They're looking at a lot of minor nuances in terms of how this works and feels,
[00:39] and almost inherent into this is the bias that everybody is thinking about this product all the day, all the time, and so on and so forth.
[00:46] Whereas the reality is, most consumers in the country or in your target market, they don't care,
[00:52] and they may have some time heard about your product.
[00:56] The word of mouth is not ever so strong, even if you're the strongest brand and so on and so forth.
[01:01] But that is the customer that you've got to bring in and then serve.
