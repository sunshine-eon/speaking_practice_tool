[00:00] Okay. So with these teams, is there anything you can share about just like how you think
[00:04] about metrics slash goals for these different buckets? We don't need to go too deeply, but
[00:09] just does everyone basically have like an absolute new merchants goal? Or is it a little
[00:14] different?
[00:15] So yeah, so you know, at the highest level, we think about that, that total cohort value,
[00:20] right? We bring in a set of merchants in a given year. How much GMV, how much, that's
[00:24] set of merchants worth over the next three, four years to Shopify, right? And that's, that's
[00:30] the most important thing that we want to focus on. And then that, of course, the for efficiency
[00:34] standpoint that of course meeting our, our payback guardrails and all that. So that's
[00:39] kind of like the macro growth perspective cohort value over kind of cost and payback.
[00:46] So that's the macro point of view. And then within growth marketing, each channel
[00:52] operates with certain guardrails around their LTVD CACs. Same thing for content SEO that
[01:00] operates with kind of a guardrail model for each piece of content. How much is that going
[01:03] to come back and down the line for growth products? It's a, also a combination of total
[01:11] GP incremental cohort value that's produced from those, those teams, right? So everything
[01:19] is basically going to be measured on from, from an experiment, ideally measured over a
[01:23] very long time period. What was the incremental core value lift that this, this generated?
[01:29] And, and that, that's how we think about it, kind of measure the impact of each of
[01:34] those, those sub teams along the way. Each of those have a specific part of the file
[01:39] they play with, but because they're measured on absolutes, and they really think about
[01:42] that absolute value, we don't get caught into like, did your conversion rate over
[01:46] the course of this year go up or down? It's kind of irrelevant. What was the sum of the
[01:51] impact over a long period on that total core value that we're trying to produce from
[01:57] for four merchants.
[01:58] And the way you come up with this goal, I imagine is you have a forecast of where things
[02:02] would go organically. And then like, here's the lift we want to see from the
[02:06] work this team does this quarter this year.
[02:09] Correct. And, and then we're going to measure against for each experiment. Did it
[02:15] actually get to where we, we expect that lift to be.
[02:18] And those experiments again, are those all long term hold that experiments where you
[02:21] look wait a year or some you
[02:24] we call we call we call the experiment after three weeks, but in all cases, you
[02:29] still watch the group is held. We watch them. And that's where that ping comes
[02:32] back. Every experiment is watched. And that ping comes back three, six months,
[02:36] 12 months to relook at was is actually successful.
[02:39] Okay, cool.
[02:41] So that creates the loop of shipping value quickly, but making sure we're
[02:46] holding ourselves accountable to did this actually produce results over a long
[02:50] period, or did it actually just have this neutral effect?
[02:54] It's like, oh, then we can learn from that and get better.
