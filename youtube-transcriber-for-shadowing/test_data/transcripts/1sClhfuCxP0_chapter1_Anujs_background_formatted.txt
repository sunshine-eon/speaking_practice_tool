============================================================

There are only three reasons why things do not happen the way you want them to happen as a leader. You can look at a person and say either that person can't do, which is a capability issue, or they won't do, which is a motivation or alignment issue, or they were not set up to do, which is really your problem for not setting up the ways of working and organizational design properly. 

As a leader, do you have the right people in terms of capability? If not, is the right answer for us to coach them, mentor them, or move them to another place because maybe their capability is suited elsewhere? If they won't do, why won't they? Are they not aligned to you? Do they not agree with your vision? Do they not have enough time? You need to really go deeper there. Why won't they do?

Today, my guest is Anuj Rati. I've been looking to get more India-based product leaders on the podcast because this podcast has a large audience in India. When I put out a call on Twitter and LinkedIn asking who I should have on, Anuj was the single most requested person. Anuj is the Chief Product and Marketing Officer at Jupiter Money. Previously, he was the Senior Vice President of Revenue and Growth at Swiggy, where he spent seven years. He was also the VP of Product at Snapdeal, a senior PM at Walmart Labs, and the very first Product Manager at Flipkart, where he led the buyer experience team.

In our conversation, we dig into how product management is different in India, Anuj's lessons about building product experiences for new users, how he operationalized the working backwards process at the companies he's worked at, and why he pushes his teams to explore three divergent directions before settling on a plan. We also discuss why he thinks product managers and companies should be much more full stack than they are, along with a bunch of frameworks and contrarian takes about building product and your career in product.

A big thank you to Sayan Maiti and Nikhil Khulkarni for helping me navigate the product scene in India. Look for more amazing India-based product leaders to come. With that, I bring you Anuj Rati after a short word from our sponsors.

This episode is brought to you by Sanity. Your website is the heart of your growth engine. For that engine to drive big results, you need to be able to move super fast, ship new content, experiment, learn, and iterate. But most content management systems just aren't built for this. Your content teams wrestle with rigid interfaces as they build new pages. You spend endless time copying and pasting across pages and recreating content for other channels and applications. Their ideas for new experiments are squashed when developers can't build them within the constraints of outdated tech.
