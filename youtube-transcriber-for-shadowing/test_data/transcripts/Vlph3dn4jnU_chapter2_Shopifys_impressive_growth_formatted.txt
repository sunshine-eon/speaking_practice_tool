Abrams. Archie, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Thanks, Lenny, excited to be here. 

Okay, so what I want to do with our time together is to basically do kind of a living archaeology of how Shopify grows and what you specifically have learned about growing a company like Shopify into this just juggernaut of a business that it's turned into. To give people a little bit of a sense of just how large Shopify has gotten, maybe surprising them about the scale of this company at this point. Could you share some stats about the scale of the business at this point?

Yeah, absolutely. So overall, we're about 10% of e-commerce in the United States. Basically, if you're not buying from Amazon or Walmart, you're probably buying on a Shopify-powered store. Behind the scenes globally, we did about 235 billion in GMV in 2023, which is roughly the size of the economy of Finland. So we've got a big economy and big impact happening from Shopify.

Wow. I think interestingly with Shopify, it's kind of this behind-the-scenes tool. I imagine many people have no idea they're using Shopify a lot of the time when they're buying stuff online. I think some of these numbers kind of creep up on people with just how large a company like Shopify has gotten.
