the note that transitioning to a B2B enterprise product is a complex journey. It requires a deep understanding of the different user expectations and the various stakeholders involved. 

As you move from a product-led growth model to a sales-led approach, it's essential to recognize that the needs of enterprise users, particularly those coming from Outlook, differ significantly from those of prosumers. This shift necessitates a focus on features that cater to these unique requirements, such as integrated calendar functionalities and compliance safeguards.

Moreover, the involvement of multiple stakeholders complicates the sales process. It's not just about the end users; IT departments and workplace management groups also play crucial roles in decision-making. They seek analytics and controls that ensure compliance and efficiency within their organizations.

In this landscape, building features that address the needs of large companies is vital. Understanding the dynamics of enterprise sales, including the importance of IT controls and user analytics, will be key to successfully navigating this transition. 

As you continue to develop Superhuman for the enterprise market, keep an eye on the opportunities that arise from these complexities. There may be gaps in the market, particularly in addressing the needs of middle management, that could present interesting avenues for growth. 

Ultimately, the journey to becoming a robust B2B enterprise product is filled with challenges, but with the right focus and understanding, it can lead to significant rewards.
