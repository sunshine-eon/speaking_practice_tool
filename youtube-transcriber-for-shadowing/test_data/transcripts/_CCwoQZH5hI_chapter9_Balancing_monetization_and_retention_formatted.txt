You can also buy a streak, right? Like with money, is that, that's a feature, right? Yeah, you can buy, and it's funny, this is also something that we buy at all the, yeah, you can buy, or freeze, sorry, not a streak. Yeah, so you can buy a streak freeze, and the way it works is you can buy gems, and then you can use those gems to buy a streak. 

This is something we wrestle with. We're actively working on an experiment right now that's having a small hit revenue, but it's a really nice one for retention. I think it's actually worth thinking about from day one as you're building a streak: do you see this more as a monetization feature, or do you see this more as a retention feature? What's the role of monetization in this? What's the role of retention? 

For us, it started out much more organically, and so we have a lot of monetization hooks that, again, as the retention PM, I would love to get rid of. But again, it's sort of part of how the streak works right now, and so we always have this tension of, hey, if we start to make it harder to buy streak freezes, then fewer people buy them, buy gems to buy them, and so there's this more convoluted series of impacts that happen. 

I love that. People wanting to buy streak freezes is like the ultimate sign of how much streaks matter. Streak freezes is the other big one that we've recently demonetized or introduced a free option for: getting back a lost streak. We used to lose streaks; we had a feature back in the day called streak repair, where we'd give you your streak back, but you had to pay gems. 

We found out it worked way better with a feature called earn back. This is basically where you would have to do a certain number of lessons as long as you came back within a window soon after losing your streak. Do a few lessons, and we just give you your streak back. It was such a retention winner. What we thought about was that it feels like you've earned it so much more when you've done something; you deserve to have your streak back. 

In this sense, the idea of cheapening the streak is something we wrestle with all the time from a philosophical level. We're giving out more streak freezes, but at what point do we cross the line and users start to realize their streak means nothing? Now, everything we've seen shows users are totally cool with using streak freezes and still thinking about their streak as this meaningful thing. 

My colleague, Antonia, who made that awesome cross stitch for me, is sort of the keeper for us of the sanctity of the streak. A lot of times, as we think about building your streak, you can almost always get engagement wins up to a certain point by just cheapening the streak, making it easier to extend, letting users have more flexibility. But you kind of got to hold the line at some point. 

It's not clear where that line is. Once you talk about one-way doors or two-way doors, there's a point where you go too far and it's a one-way door. All of a sudden, those users, those nine million users on one-year streaks, don't care about their streak anymore. From a retention PM perspective, that would be an extinction-level event for us. I don't want all of these users just not caring about their streak. 

To have somebody who is invested in the sanctity of the streak, and for us, it's Antonia and Luis, who is very good about this, is really important to ensure you don't go too far. That's an awesome insight.
