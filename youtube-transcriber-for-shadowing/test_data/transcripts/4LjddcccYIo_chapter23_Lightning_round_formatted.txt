============================================================

Okay, well with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready? I'm ready. 

Maggie, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people? First, the most common one is probably "The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs." It's a little tiny one, but a really great way to improve your speaking skills and your presentation skills, and to get distracted executives to agree with the point you're making. So that's one. The second one is "Thinking in Bets" by Annie Duke. I'm coming back to the point about being able to make bets; I think that one's really interesting. And then, as a bonus third one, this is more like a desk reference that I now have on my desk: "The Scaling People" book by Claire Hughes Johnson. I really enjoyed the way that one is working, and it just sits on my desk. I reference it every once in a while, especially as a manager. I have it both under my laptop right where I'm sitting and then also way behind there. It's one of the most popular episodes I've done with Claire, so if folks haven't listened to that one, I highly recommend it. She's incredible.

Great choice! What is a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed? 

Okay, so my husband is in the industry, as we say, here in LA. We watch a lot of good and bad shows and TV, but I think my favorite one that I've watched recently was "Slow Horses." Gary Oldman is incredible. Highly recommend.

Well, I haven't heard that one yet. Good tip! What is a favorite interview question you really like to ask, which I think you already gave away, but let's touch on it again. 

Yeah, it is: what is the worst product that you've ever shipped? I think the best answers are ones where people immediately laugh a little bit. They remember the horrible thing they did and then they share that horrible thing with you. It tells me that you have some humor, you're humble, and you can point out when you've made a mistake, right? You've done enough to be able to confidently say, like, of course, I've made a mistake because none of us are perfect. You know how to spot those mistakes, and you can learn from them. I've always found that those conversations are the most interesting.

What is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really like? 

One, because I've seen you on Twitter, you're a future fit guy. 

Yeah, I am. Three times a week? 

Yes, I was also a future fit person. Love it! I think it's great. I'm now on ladder fit, and personally, I love not having to talk to the coach every day. I don't need the accountability. As an ex-athlete, that didn't serve me. For me, I like the anonymity of it, and it comes with a totally unhinged group chat for your whole team. It's fantastic. I'm really enjoying it.

Sweet! So that's one. More of a funny one. The second one, not to get real niche, but I think good products are products that are focused. They do one thing incredibly well. There's this app called Pumplog. As a new mom, I've never seen it execute so well on one problem. There's not a single thing where I think, oh, I wish it did this. It does it. I paid $14 for it; I've never paid for an app like that in my life.

Okay, I'm downloading it right after we finish! Do you have a favorite life motto that you either repeat to yourself often, like to share with folks, or find useful in just living life? 

I'm sure there are aspirational mottos I could say, but the real one is: if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well. From being in sports to going to school to being in product, in my opinion, if you're going to do something, do it to the best of your ability. You spend so much time working; you may as well be good at it or trying to get good at it. That's always how I've lived my life.

I so love that message. I always think about that. 

Final question: you are an Olympic speed skater, which I don't think people would know necessarily—that's insane! My question is, is there some bad speed skating that would surprise people? 

Oh, that is one I've never been asked before. The whole experience has taught me a ton, and I think what might surprise people about being a small sport athlete is that you have to think in four or eight-year chunks. You grind for so long in like a dark corner, and then you get a chance to have the light shine on you. You learn how to love the process. Especially for speed skating, I was a long track speed skater. It's a 400-meter rink; you just are always turning left and going in a circle. There's not a lot going on. It's just you and your thoughts. You learn how to get good at perfecting something over and over again. You learn how to grind and focus. I think it's also cool you get to go super fast. But yeah, I don't know if that would surprise people about speed skating. It's really about years and years of toiling in silence to get maybe one shot at something great.

So much of what you just said would apply 100 percent to product management. 

And I love that, Maggie, you are awesome! 

Two final questions: where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe ask you any follow-up questions? 

You can find me on Twitter for sure. LinkedIn too, but I'm just not into LinkedIn posting. 

LinkedIn's gotten better. I'd give it a shot; it's actually pretty interesting now. 

Yeah, I'm thinking about it. I go back to work in a couple of weeks and am considering LinkedIn. But yeah, Twitter for sure, LinkedIn for sure. I've always tried to be helpful to other people, so I don't have an answer for how people can be helpful to me. My goal is really to share what I've been doing, the rooms that I get to be in, the access to the content and the people, and the learning that I've had. Hopefully, I can find ways to keep sharing that. Maybe check out Toast and use Toast when they're at restaurants. 

Oh, yes! Plug Toast, come work with us. We're the best. I get to work with John Cutler; it's phenomenal. 

Legendary previous guest! Are there roles you're hiring for, just for folks that are listening and thinking, hey, maybe I should go do that? 

There are always roles that are open. I don't know what the most open roles are right now, but yeah, check it out. It's a great place. We'll link to the careers page.

Awesome! Thank you again so much for being here.
