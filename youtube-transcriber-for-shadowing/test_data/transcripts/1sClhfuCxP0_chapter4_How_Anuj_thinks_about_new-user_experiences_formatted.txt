Wow, fascinating. I could keep going, but I want to talk product. I've collected a bunch of questions from people that know you or people that have worked with you, all about a bunch of different stuff, so I'm just going to kind of go a little bit all over the place.

The first area I wanted to talk about is the new user experience. Apparently, you have an interesting insight and kind of a different approach to thinking about new users and new user experiences. One of the things that I realized once we started working on the products is that product managers and, generally, companies are too engrossed in thinking about the product. 

It's close to their heart, and they're looking at it all the time. They're focused on a lot of minor nuances in terms of how this works and feels. Almost inherent in this is the bias that everyone is thinking about this product all day, all the time, and so on and so forth. 

Whereas the reality is, most consumers in the country or in your target market don’t care. They may have heard about your product, but the word of mouth is not ever so strong, even if you're the strongest brand. That is the customer that you've got to bring in and then serve.
