============================================================

[15:43] of the product and hopefully somehow how we might operate it.
[15:46] So I think with your vantage point
[15:48] at being at the center of hiring,
[15:52] a lot is changing within the hiring marketplace
[15:54] in the past, I don't know, year at this point
[15:56] where it used to be very candidate oriented
[15:59] and where they had all the power
[16:00] and the salaries were crazy, everyone's bidding
[16:03] and trying to get people to join their company
[16:05] and now it's completely opposite.
[16:06] There's so many people looking, companies have all the power.
[16:10] I'm curious what you've seen
[16:12] if that's roughly it or what you're seeing
[16:14] basically in the hiring market these days.
[16:16] Well, first of all, the balance that you're talking about,
[16:19] it is shifting in the sense that there are more seekers
[16:21] in the marketplace now
[16:23] and there are fewer open jobs in the marketplace.
[16:25] And then of course that changes how many applications
[16:27] you get for the job and how you have to look through.
[16:29] I think there's a model where people think it's shifting
[16:32] dramatically to exactly the way it was.
[16:34] And I actually think some of the changes that occurred
[16:37] during the last couple of years
[16:38] are actually sticking around.
[16:39] And so let me give you a couple of examples
[16:41] of where things I think are really changing.
[16:44] So the first thing that happened was,
[16:46] and maybe in my opinion, one of the big changes to the world
[16:48] that no one's really kind of talking about it
[16:50] to my degree is the impact of it,
[16:52] but there's been a real move to skills-based hiring.
[16:55] So for the longest time,
[16:56] and I'll give you actually a really concrete example,
[16:59] it was like March, 2020 and we were just watching COVID hit
[17:01] and it was just this heartbreaking kind of moment
[17:04] where in the feed you were seeing all these people
[17:05] by no fault of their own starting to post
[17:07] that they've lost their job.
[17:09] And we started seeing in our data as you had some areas,
[17:12] like maybe hospitality was really getting hit,
[17:14] but some areas like customer service
[17:15] that just couldn't hire enough.
[17:17] And you think the marketplace would balance pretty quickly.
[17:20] You think, okay, maybe these people will start moving
[17:21] to other jobs, but it wasn't happening.
[17:24] And a large reason behind this,
[17:25] people are used to looking for certain particular titles
[17:28] and they didn't start realizing
[17:29] how other people could do this job.
[17:31] So we made a pretty big push in something
[17:32] we call skills-first hiring.
[17:34] This was the idea that we could translate people's experiences
[17:38] into a set of skills.
[17:39] And by that, we could help them really start balancing
[17:41] the marketplace with a much different system, right?
[17:44] But instead of saying, I need to have this talent,
[17:45] you can say I need someone who can do negotiation
[17:47] and I need someone who can really help me kind of
[17:51] understand how to de-escalate a customer situation.
[17:53] And you find a lot of people in hospitality
[17:55] have about 70% of the skills in customer service
[17:57] and of course you could train up the rest.
[17:59] And so we started seeing the skills-first hiring
[18:01] really start taking off.
[18:02] And at this point, roughly 47% of our recruiters
[18:06] will come in explicitly use skills
[18:08] when they start looking for candidates.
[18:10] And that's a pretty big change that we're actually seeing.
[18:12] So it's not like people are starting to,
[18:14] I know it's early in some of these changes,
[18:15] but it's a change where I think people are still
[18:18] continuing to start looking at skills.
[18:20] Another one was this concept of there's a lot more people
[18:23] who are starting to look for jobs by values.
[18:26] They were saying, look, Mimus job sites work,
[18:28] you come in and you look for a job and a title
[18:30] and that's kind of how you navigate the world.
[18:32] And we started realizing a lot of people wanted to come in
[18:35] and instead of look at it like that,
[18:36] they may say, look, I really want a job
[18:38] that's aligned my purpose or even by an interest.
[18:40] I may want something in AI.
[18:42] And we started launching collections
[18:43] and the way to filter in these things.
[18:44] We're still being some of that used to say.
[18:47] And so I think that the job market is rebalancing,
[18:49] but it's being done, the pathers are being done
[18:51] in a very different way that seems to be something
[18:54] that maybe a change that holds through
[18:56] these ups and downs and I'll be very interesting to see.
[18:58] What's interesting is it's not like this would change
[19:01] on its own.
[19:02] This is as you're the biggest job
[19:05] as marketplace in the world, right?
[19:07] We have a lot of professional jobs in our platform
[19:10] and a lot of professional seekers.
[19:12] I'm serious.
[19:13] I imagine it is, I don't know.
[19:14] I guess indeed might be a competitor,
[19:15] but okay, let's say it's one of the bigger job markets.
[19:18] Like you influence the way jobs are sought and posted, right?
[19:23] And how people find jobs.
[19:24] So in a sense, designing sounds like basically
[19:27] there was an internal decision.
[19:28] Let's focus on a skills approach.
[19:30] And what's cool about that is that changes
[19:31] the way hiring happens in the world.
[19:33] It's one of the things that I think is so interesting
[19:35] about building products today is,
[19:37] has to clearly be something people want.
[19:39] Like if we had just said, we're gonna go like this
[19:41] and every hire was like, I don't wanna do this
[19:43] or every job seekers that this is not care about.
[19:44] I don't think anything would click.
[19:46] We also have to be receptive enough
[19:47] to kind of amplify that signal and allow it to work
[19:50] through a system so that it could actually be easy to use.
[19:53] And so I don't know if it was,
[19:55] I don't think we said that,
[19:59] hey, we gotta go and do this value of this thing.
[20:01] I think we started feeling it and hearing it from members.
[20:03] And then as we adapted,
[20:04] these things started amplifying as they come through.
[20:07] I do think that's hopefully something that,
[20:10] I think about a lot is,
[20:12] let's just make sure that we keep a pulse on what people want.
[20:16] And we make sure that we can kind of get that
[20:18] through a system at a pretty fast pace
[20:20] because then we will hopefully continue to be a place
[20:22] where people wanna go look for jobs and make hires.
