Column A represents the traditional work environment of today's world, while Column B embodies the dream reality we aspire to create. The idea is to work backwards from that dream to figure out how to achieve it. This approach is reminiscent of how Brian Chesky, co-founder of Airbnb, conceptualized his vision. During my time at Airbnb, we were encouraged to envision the ideal world and then strategize backwards from that vision. This method has proven to be effective, and it's a crucial lesson for anyone looking to innovate.

In the case of Canva, Column A would have been nonexistent. When I was a university student, I had no company, no business experience, and no software background. The reality was quite limited. Therefore, everything stemmed from Column B, which involved imagining the future we wanted to create. I envisioned what publishing and communication would look like, and it was clear to me that the future would not be confined to complicated desktop applications. I believed that design would eventually become online, collaborative, and user-friendly. Although I had no idea how to build that future, I was convinced it was possible. We initially applied this vision to the school yearbook market in Australia with our first company, Fusion MOOCs, and then expanded it to Canva, aiming for something much larger.

For founders who are eager to build a Column B company, the first step is to imagine the future they want to create. What kind of world do you envision? Consider the future of transportation, healthcare, or any other area that interests you. Personally, I have a vision board in my office that outlines my aspirations for the world in 2050. While you may not be able to bring that vision to life immediately, clarifying what you want is essential. Think about inclusivity and ensuring that everyone's basic human needs are met. 

An exercise we often engage in is defining what "wild success" looks like for various initiatives, as well as what constitutes a terrible failure. This kind of abstract thinking can be applied across different industries and areas within a company. Taking a long-term perspective—say, ten years—and developing a clear idea of what you want or don’t want is crucial. Many people overlook the importance of spending time on this vision.

Once you have a clear picture of your desired future, it’s vital to translate that dream into actionable steps. You need a ladder that leads up to your ambitious vision, with rungs that represent incremental steps toward that goal. It’s important to take small, consistent actions, no matter how insignificant they may seem. If each step is directed toward the future you want to create, you will gradually ascend that ladder.

Some may feel they already have a vision and know where they want to go, but they might be missing the deeper significance of this process. It’s easy to become discouraged when faced with the vast difference between dreaming about the future and taking tiny, initial steps toward it. Many people focus on immediate tasks—emails, messages, and daily responsibilities—that distract them from long-term thinking. Setting aside time to dream about what success looks like in ten years and what failure might entail is critical. Even if your vision feels overwhelming, taking that first small step is essential. Each step builds upon the last, and for us, this compounding effect has been evident over the past decade as we work toward our mission.

I want to discuss how we operationalize this vision. I heard from one of your team members, Melissa Tan, that every project kickoff includes a vision deck outlining the big picture. This is where many people struggle—understanding how to implement these ideas. We refer to this process as moving from chaos to clarity. Every idea begins in a chaotic state, whether it's a concept, a problem, or a belief. 

The joke I often share is, "How do you go from chaos to clarity? You add clarity." The initial step might simply involve writing your ideas down instead of keeping them in your head. From there, you can create a pitch deck, refine it, and develop designs or prototypes. As you progress from chaos to clarity, your vision becomes more tangible and comprehensible to others. Taking these incremental steps adds clarity at each stage, allowing you to bring your ideas to life rather than letting them remain abstract and unformed in your mind. This is why visual communication is so vital for us; if your ideas are only in your head, no one else can see them, and you cannot manifest them into reality.
