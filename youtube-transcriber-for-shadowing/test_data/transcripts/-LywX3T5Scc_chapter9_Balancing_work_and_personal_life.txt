============================================================

[00:00] you're doing, you're actually doing.
[00:01] I want to come back to that.
[00:02] That's a whole really cool process.
[00:04] Do you have with closing the loop with customers?
[00:05] But something else I want to talk about while we're on this topic of growth every time.
[00:09] I saw you post something about how you had to realize they had to slow down
[00:13] and not just work, work, work like crazy.
[00:16] Talk about just that realization and why that ended up being so valuable.
[00:20] So in the early days, I would just work seven days a week around the clock.
[00:24] In our very first company, we actually had printing presses because we were printing
[00:28] the yearbooks in my mom's house and then delivering them to schools around Australia.
[00:34] And in the early days of Canva, we certainly were working all weekend,
[00:38] all hours of the day.
[00:39] It was just constant.
[00:42] But when you've been doing this for a while, if you just keep working at that pace,
[00:47] I don't think it's good for anyone's health, mental health or anything else.
[00:51] So I think finding ways to continue, like I still work extraordinarily hard,
[00:57] but to continue to have that balance in my day to day where I actually go to sleep,
[01:03] I find time to do things like going for walks or doing yoga, journaling.
[01:08] I find extraordinarily helpful to make sure that I can always bring my best to everything that I'm doing.
[01:14] It's easy to say that kind of stuff.
[01:16] It must be really hard to actually make time for that thing.
[01:18] Is there anything for those sorts of things?
[01:20] Is there anything that you do that allows you to actually protect that time to actually do these things?
[01:25] Because as you said, there's a billion things that are just looking for your attention constantly.
[01:29] I feel like I've developed some healthy habits over the years.
[01:32] I don't have emails like on my phone.
[01:34] And so when I shut my laptop, I actually tune out.
[01:38] And then if there's a real issue, I'll get an emergency call or page.
[01:42] But I think trying to delineate, I think is really important.
[01:46] So when I'm working, I'm all in.
[01:48] And then when I'm not working, I'm all out.
[01:51] And actually giving that mental space, I think is really important.
[01:54] I've spoken to a lot of founders that haven't quite found that and then do struggle with it.
[01:58] So when they're working every weekend, it feels like the right thing.
[02:02] But then sometimes you can miss the forest from the trees when you're just working harder and harder.
[02:07] But maybe you're actually working on the wrong thing.
[02:10] And so I think being able to step away a little just to be able to get perspective to be out.
