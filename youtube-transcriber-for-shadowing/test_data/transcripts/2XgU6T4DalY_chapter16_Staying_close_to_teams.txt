============================================================

[00:00] as well.
[00:01] Awesome.
[00:02] Okay.
[00:03] I want to ask two more questions before we get to our very exciting lightning round.
[00:05] And they're both skills that little birdies have told me you're very good at.
[00:10] One is that you are very intentional and thoughtful about staying close to individual teams and
[00:17] individuals within the company, even though you're higher and higher in the org.
[00:22] I'm curious how you do that, how you actually practice this skill of staying really close
[00:26] to teams kind of at the bottom of the ladder and individuals that are working on the ground,
[00:32] basically.
[00:33] A lot of it is how I spend my time and fighting to preserve opportunities to connect with
[00:41] people.
[00:42] So examples would be, I still have bi-weekly office hours, people sign up for slots.
[00:49] And I get, it can feel a little like speed dating for 20 minute slots, but I get to meet
[00:55] a whole bunch of people and hear about work, hear what's top of mind.
[01:02] And people book them out many months ahead and it's just an opportunity to stay in touch.
[01:08] And then I do ask me anything, sessions with teams of different sizes, depending on how
[01:15] intimate we want it to feel.
[01:17] But truly anything is fair game as a way to get to know me as a person for me to hear
[01:23] questions, to try to be candid about what I can answer, can't answer.
[01:28] And so those things have helped me maintain connection, but both of those examples are
[01:35] about making the time for it.
[01:38] So what I have found as my role has changed is that it just wouldn't happen if I didn't
[01:45] make it a priority.
[01:48] And then through those types of sessions, I do think I become, or I hope to become more
[01:52] approachable. So people know, you can send me a Slack message, you can send me an email,
[01:56] like I mentioned earlier, I'm going to respond to you as quickly as I can because I want
[02:00] to hold myself to that bar.
[02:02] And so that builds a flow of communication between me and the team that I really value.
[02:08] I don't think I would want to do my job if I didn't have those points of connection.
[02:11] So that helps too.
[02:13] And you also send my emails to everyone after every leadership meeting.
[02:15] So they're like, oh yeah, Elizabeth.
[02:16] Yeah, they hear from me.
