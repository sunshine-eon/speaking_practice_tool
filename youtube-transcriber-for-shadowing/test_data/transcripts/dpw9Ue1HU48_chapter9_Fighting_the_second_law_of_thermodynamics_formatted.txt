============================================================

You've been talking about simplicity. The opposite extreme is entropy. Someone told me that you have this kind of concept that every leader in every business is fighting the second law of thermodynamics, which I believe is entropy. 

The actual law states that within a closed system, entropy increases over time. We don't have to get into the details, but I love physics. We're getting into the real first principles of everything. What does that mean when you're running a business? 

In layperson's terms, the second law of thermodynamics—I'm paraphrasing here—means that over time, unless you intervene, everything goes to crap. Essentially, the amount of disorder and randomness in a system is going to increase over time. You see this in everyday life. For example, when you break an egg, the molecules don't come together to form an egg again. It always goes the other way; it becomes disorderly and more random. That's the second law of thermodynamics, and this happens in companies as well. 

In the early stages of a company, you're essentially fighting to survive—just trying not to die. That's the primary focus: "Okay, like Friday, one, don't die." In the second phase, you're trying not to stagnate. You still want to drive growth because stagnation is essentially death. So, you're still trying not to die. 

Then, in the third stage, you're fighting complexity. This is where you can crumble under your own weight over time, absent some external intervention. You see this happen all the time, and it manifests in different ways. Everything gets more complicated; you need more layers of management, more headcount, and more resources. Everything becomes harder, and bad things start to happen. You become slower, and that's eventually a slower death. 

Complexity does kill companies, maybe not as quickly as other factors, but much more reliably. This is why it's never too early to plant the seeds of simplicity and make it part of the culture of the organization. We have a principle in our culture called "fight for simplicity." It's literally those three words. 

The message we're trying to convey is that simplicity is worth fighting for. It's important, but it requires effort. It will be a fight because the universe is working against you. It takes energy to achieve simplicity because everything, even well-intentioned people, will introduce complexity. That's the natural way of the world. We want more tiers in our pricing, more knobs and dials in the product—everything tends toward the second law, and entropy increases. 

So anyway, I love this.
