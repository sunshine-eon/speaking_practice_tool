Chapter 18: How setting ambitious goals improves team performance
Video: Brian Chesky’s new playbook
Time: 45:57 - 50:05
============================================================

[00:00] A defining characteristic of Brian Chesky in my mind is how big you make people think,
[00:07] how you push people to think bigger.
[00:09] Memories I have of you is in meetings we present our goal and you're always saying,
[00:14] how do we 10x this?
[00:15] What would it take to 10x this idea?
[00:18] And somehow we often hit these crazy goals after you 10x them or sometimes just double
[00:23] them.
[00:24] What have you learned about just the power of setting really ambitious goals, but also
[00:29] finding the balance with not demoralizing people if they don't hit these really ambitious
[00:34] goals?
[00:35] As you know, there was a saying inside of Airbnb, it was add a zero, add a zero at
[00:40] the end, which is to make, to imagine something order managed bigger.
[00:45] The exercise isn't necessarily to say, if people say they want to hit a goal, I say,
[00:50] okay, I added a zero, you have to hit that goal.
[00:53] It's more the exercise of what would it take to be 10x bigger or do something 10x better?
[00:59] Because what you find is when you push people, they will sometimes think about the problem
[01:03] differently.
[01:05] And one of the best ways to get unstuck from a problem is to imagine a 10x scale or 10x
[01:10] better or 10x faster where you can't do the current process to do it.
[01:15] You have to think differently about the problem.
[01:18] And to think differently about the problem means you have to deeply understand the problem.
[01:21] And to deeply understand the problem, you have to break it into its components.
[01:24] And we might call this like first principle thinking.
[01:27] And that's one of the foundational elements that comprise this problem.
[01:31] And how can we reconstruct them?
[01:32] So the first thing is, I think by adding a zero, at least conceptually for teams to
[01:37] help some understand a problem.
[01:39] The second is, I think one of the most important things for a founder or leader to do is set
[01:43] the pace of the team.
[01:44] I think the pace of the team is one of the most important things you can do.
[01:48] And that pace is sometimes governed not by how hard people work, but how decisive they
[01:52] are.
[01:54] If you want to improve the speed of a company, then make faster decisions.
[01:58] And that fast decisions come from a bias of action.
[02:01] If we're in a meeting, we don't just say, like, okay, let's circle back on this next
[02:05] week.
[02:06] No, we'll have it done by next week.
[02:08] Let's stay in this meeting until it's done.
[02:09] What are you doing?
[02:10] Have a bias for action.
[02:11] Who's responsible?
[02:12] Okay, what are you doing?
[02:13] Okay, let's check in an hour.
[02:15] I'll call you in the morning.
[02:16] Okay, how are we going to do this?
[02:17] And so you end up getting three months of work done over that period of time.
[02:21] But the last thing I'll say about adding a zero Lenny is I remember there was a story
[02:26] about a great basketball coach named John Wooden.
[02:30] He was one of the winningest basketball coaches I think in college basketball history, perhaps
[02:34] the greatest.
[02:35] And someone asked him once, I'm going to paraphrase what he said, like, what is your secret to
[02:39] success?
[02:40] And he said that, you know, I just asked my players to do their very best.
[02:45] And I remember thinking to myself, that doesn't sound like the secret to success, asking people
[02:50] to do their best.
[02:51] But there was an implicit thing that he didn't say, which is that he saw potential people
[02:57] that they never saw in themselves.
[03:00] And so the role of a leader is to see potential in people that they may not even see themselves.
[03:06] And when I tell somebody it's not good enough, either I'm saying you're not good enough,
[03:13] or I believe that you have more potential than you're showing me.
[03:17] So in other words, you can push a team and they could feel demoralized because they can
[03:21] feel like what they're doing is not good enough if they have a fixed mindset.
[03:24] Or you create a growth mindset organization where the more I'm involved, the more I say
[03:28] you can do better, it's because the more I believe in you and I know that you have more
[03:32] in you.
[03:33] And the way to know if a team could do better is if their life depended on it, could they
[03:37] do it?
[03:38] And Andy Grove used to say that there's competency and motivation.
[03:42] And motivation is if they're like, and they not literally depended on it, but like, if
[03:46] it was a crisis or if it was like a defining moment in their lives.
[03:49] I think the job of a leader is not to make it life and death.
[03:52] That's too far.
[03:53] But to be able to motivate a team to see potential in them that they don't see in themselves
[03:58] and to really push them to set a tempo, to break something down to first principle thinking.
[04:02] And if you do that, then I think that's going to be the opposite of these slow moving kind
[04:06] of soul crushing bureaucracies.
