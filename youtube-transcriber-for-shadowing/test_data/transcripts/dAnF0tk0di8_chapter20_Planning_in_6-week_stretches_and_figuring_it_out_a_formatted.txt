============================================================

It's clear that you've designed your life and your business in a very intentional way. The default path, as I reference from another podcast episode, is to build a company, raise a bunch of money, create a massive business, generate a lot of revenue, and then exit to try something else. You've taken a very different approach.

Can I speak up about that? This idea of the "pathless path"—is that kind of what we're talking about? I'm moderately familiar with that concept. I didn't listen to that podcast, but I saw some clips. It's interesting because, while you've intentionally designed your life, I find that I hold certain principles or directions but don’t think about any of this ahead of time. 

In fact, when it comes to my company, we don’t have a multi-year plan. I don’t even have a one-year plan, or even a six-month plan. We think about everything we’re going to do every six weeks. We rethink our direction regularly, so we’re very much in the now, making it up as we go along. This is true for my personal career as well; I didn’t have any of this planned out. I didn’t decide I wanted to be like this or like that. I just figure out what works and keep doing that until it doesn’t, and then maybe we do something else. 

I’m not on a defined path. I can’t see the path I’m on, but I know we’re all going somewhere. I don’t want to stand still, but I’m perfectly comfortable not knowing where I’m going. For me, it’s really about making it up as I go, based on being in touch with how things feel, what my intuition tells me, and what makes me happy. 

Sometimes, things that make you happy aren’t feasible due to life’s constraints, so it’s about understanding that and figuring out the trade-offs. Ultimately, I believe it’s the best way to run a business. It’s the healthiest, most honest way to operate, figuring things out as you go. The further out you plan, the less you know about the decisions you’re making. By the time you get there, you’re probably going to be wrong or want to do something else. 

If you don’t adapt, you end up doing things you don’t want to do because you committed to them in the past. Obligations in the future can be quite dangerous and can lead people down a path of unhappiness. Staying closer to the present is probably the best way to navigate this.

A lot of this stems from the biggest decision we made: not raising money and keeping control of the business. You’re the boss, and there’s no one above you. Independence is crucial. If you go to 37signals.com, you’ll find 37 ideas, and the first one is about independence. We made that an intentional decision. We didn’t know all the implications it would have, but we knew we wanted to do what we wanted to do. 

To me, being an entrepreneur means working for yourself. The moment you take money or have big obligations, you end up working for someone else. I understand why some companies do it, but I don’t understand why many people do it when they probably shouldn’t. Staying independent is a wonderfully fulfilling experience, but it’s hard to maintain when you’re beholden to someone else’s timeline and expectations.

Another thing we rarely have here are expectations. When we launch a new product, I don’t know what’s going to happen. When we launched Basecamp, I didn’t know what would happen. When we launched Hey, I didn’t know what would happen. We’re going to launch some new stuff soon, and I still don’t know what will happen. We don’t set goals like, “If this gets 20,000 users, then it’s a success.” We don’t care about that. 

We’re making it anyway, and we’ll see what happens. The market will tell us what happens, and I’m content to wait and find out. There’s no sense in spending time thinking about what could be.
