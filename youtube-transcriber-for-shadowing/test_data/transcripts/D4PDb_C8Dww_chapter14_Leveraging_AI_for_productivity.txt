============================================================

[00:00] I'm going to take us to AI Corner, this little segment we have in the podcast, where I try
[00:05] to understand how people are using AI in their day to day and in their business.
[00:10] I'm curious if you've found some really interesting way of using AI, ideally in, like, you can
[00:17] go in either one of these directions, in how you and your team work day to day using
[00:21] AI tools to make you more efficient, or integrating AI into your product, making DoorDash
[00:27] better.
[00:28] Yeah, I mean, I think that there are opportunities in both.
[00:32] I think one of the things I'm really excited about is actually, so the former, so in helping
[00:38] to make the team more productive, we do something called office hours at DoorDash, the analytics
[00:45] team.
[00:46] And it's something that we started eight years ago, and it was a way to provide support
[00:54] for teams that at the time, we just didn't have the bandwidth to support.
[00:58] So we would go, we would, in the early days, we'd go sit in a room and we'd say, come on
[01:03] in and we'll help you with anything you need help with, we'll help teach you SQL, we'll
[01:08] help look at some of your work, we'll be a thought partner, you could just come
[01:12] and learn what we're working on, whatever it was, we would do two hours every week
[01:17] of office hours at different times to be friendly to different time zones.
[01:22] I think one of the things I'm excited about is being able to really empower some of the
[01:27] folks that are still coming to office hours for one thing or another to be able to use
[01:32] AI to help edit queries on their own, for example, to be able to say, here's a
[01:38] query, I want to make this, please adjust this to our grocery business so that I can
[01:45] see, you know, the GOV for grocery.
[01:49] And so working to build these tools that will help, not just our team in terms
[01:55] of time saving, and also, to be honest, folks are going to use it on our team,
[02:00] but really to be able to empower non-technical users to be able to do
[02:05] things on their own and not have to take up bandwidth for the analytics team.
[02:09] So essentially it's the chatbot that anyone in the company can talk to you
[02:12] to get advice on how to write SQL queries, query data, and things like that.
[02:16] Yeah.
[02:16] Is there a clever name for this chatbot, perchance?
[02:20] So it's not clever.
[02:22] It's called Ask Data AI, and that's named for our internal Slack channel
[02:28] that used to be the open kind of Q&A for people to ask data.
[02:34] So it's not at all clever, but again, the theme of very, very specific
[02:40] naming conventions that we have at DoorDash, never delivered in Ask Data AI.
[02:47] I love it.
[02:48] Just clarity above all else.
[02:50] That's something I've learned from an editor that I work with.
