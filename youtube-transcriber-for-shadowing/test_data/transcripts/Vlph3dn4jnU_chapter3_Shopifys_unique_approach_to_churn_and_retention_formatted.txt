============================================================

I want to start with something that I think is most unique from what I've heard, and I think there's going to be a lot of really unique approaches to how you all think about growth. One of the most interesting things I've heard is how you think about churn and retention. To most companies, the most important thing is to increase retention and reduce churn. My sense, or my understanding, is you guys are kind of the opposite. You don't think tons about churn; you almost optimize for it. Talk about that. How does that work?

The way we think about churn is really going back to Shopify as our mission and what we want to do, which is to increase the amount of entrepreneurship on the Internet. As a business, we want to make it as easy as possible to get started with your online store and your business. However, most businesses do ultimately fail. The way we look at it is, can we lower the barriers to getting started and get as many people in the door trying their hand at entrepreneurship? If we do that, many of those businesses, many of those folks will maybe not be successful on their first attempt, but we're going to have a set of merchants who go on to become extremely big businesses, the Alberts of the world, Figs, et cetera.

The way the Shopify business model works is we do charge a subscription, but most of our revenue comes from payments, which is tied directly to a merchant's success. In a given cohort of merchants, a lot of people will start. Some of those people, on their first attempt at entrepreneurship, might not succeed, but the folks who do go on to be successful will make that entire cohort of merchants who started something that makes Shopify as a business extremely successful. That's why we lower the barriers to get started and help folks grow; those winners make the whole thing work.

I love that. What I'm hearing is it's not that you don't want people to stick around. It's not that you don't want people to succeed. It's that you're not optimizing every new shop for sticking around long term. It's basically about making it as easy as possible for people to try it, and all you need is a few big wins for it to all work out.

Correct. That's really a different insight than most SaaS companies. They get a customer and really never want that person to leave, while we want to lower the barriers to getting started.
