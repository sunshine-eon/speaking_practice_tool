============================================================

[00:00] There's something else along these lines of DAO's and ARPU's and efficiency that you talked
[00:06] about that I love, which is this idea that focus is a curse in Asian markets.
[00:12] That in the US, there's often this advice, focus, build one thing that's amazing that
[00:16] everyone loves, try to make that work, scale that, and then only then build a new product
[00:20] or build something, build a new big feature and your advice is in India and Asian markets
[00:26] in general, it's the opposite.
[00:27] And I think it's because you make so little per user, could you talk about that?
[00:30] Yeah, I think one is you make very little per user, so you have to do many things.
[00:35] But also, all low trust markets, and let me define low trust markets as their consumers
[00:41] are a lot more wary of trying new things because there are no institutions that protect
[00:47] you against a bad behavior done by a company, right?
[00:49] So for example, if I ever had a fall in a coffee shop in the US, I can think
[00:54] about suing them and making money off it.
[00:56] In India, you're only worried about I'm going to pay my thing and you don't even
[00:59] think about suing the coffee shop or you're hoping that you will get any money for that.
[01:03] So what happens is in a low trust country, all developing nations are low trust by design
[01:10] because the institutions are not strong enough to really, really take care of many things.
[01:14] What happens is there is concentration of trust.
[01:16] So you will see that super apps, super stars, super companies all exist
[01:20] in low trust markets because the lack of trust creates concentration of trust, right?
[01:26] And therefore, you will see one app can do 400 things.
[01:29] For example, we have a company like Tata that can do salt to car to jewelry to anything
[01:35] that people will buy because it's a Tata brand because it comes from a low trust
[01:38] society trusting the brand and not being, oh, I'm going to cause preferred this new brand.
[01:45] And the joy for trying new things is not so high in low trust nations.
[01:52] Wow, I'm learning a lot here.
[01:53] I didn't know all this.
[01:54] So essentially, brand is even more exponentially more important in Indian markets.
[01:59] It's funny, but the oldest brand in the world is a brand called as Chauhan Prash.
[02:05] It's a guy named Chauhan who built a Prash.
[02:08] This is a sort of a pace that you can have for good health.
[02:11] And it was built in India many, many, many, many centuries ago.
[02:18] And when there are lots of Indian businesses still have the name of the person behind it.
[02:24] Even the U.S. is just like that, like JP Morgan, all these guys are not some fancy
[02:28] name, they're name of people.
[02:30] And therefore in India, trust still comes from a lot of names of people who have a
[02:36] lot of trust behind them and reputation.
