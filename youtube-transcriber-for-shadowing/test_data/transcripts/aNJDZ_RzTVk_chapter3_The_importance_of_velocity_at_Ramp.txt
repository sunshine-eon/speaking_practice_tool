Video: Velocity over everything: How Ramp became the fastest-growing SaaS startup ever | Geoff Charles

============================================================

[00:00] You glossed over that stat of just ramp is essentially known as the fastest growing
[00:04] SaaS business in history and also fintech business, like in two categories,
[00:08] the fastest ramp to 200 million dollars, right?
[00:12] And run rate.
[00:14] Yeah.
[00:14] Okay.
[00:15] So for that reason, and many other reasons, there's a lot of interest in just
[00:18] how ramp operates and how you all approach product.
[00:21] And we actually previously collaborated on a newsletter post on how ramp built
[00:26] product and that newsletter post is now the eighth most popular post on
[00:29] my newsletter across hundreds of posts that I've written and even more than how
[00:34] Figma builds product and how snowflake builds product and all these other
[00:37] incredible companies.
[00:38] And so clearly there's a lot of interest in how you operate.
[00:41] So I'm really excited to get into the meat of how you all work.
[00:45] And if anyone read this post and has any sense of just how you all operate,
[00:49] there's this one word that immediately comes to mind when people think
[00:53] of how ramp operates and that word is velocity.
[00:56] So I want to start there.
[00:58] Can you just talk about how important velocity is to how you work and where
[01:03] that came from and how that actually looks day to day at working at ramp?
[01:07] Absolutely.
[01:07] So you mentioned it.
[01:09] I mean, you know that velocity is everything at ramp.
[01:11] It's how we design our product development process.
[01:14] It's how we incentivize teams.
[01:16] It's who we want to hire.
[01:18] It's who we want to promote and it's everything around how we make
[01:20] decisions and how we organize the organization.
[01:23] And I think, you know, it came from the fact that during the pandemic,
[01:28] we started with a very small team and there was a huge market
[01:32] opportunity ahead of us and it wasn't so much, you know, which path we wanted
[01:35] to pick, but rather how fast we were able to execute on that path.
[01:39] And so velocity was kind of in grade from the early days on just building,
[01:42] shipping and iterating.
[01:43] And I think it's a decent metric for how companies and teams perform.
[01:48] You know, you might say, well, you know, what's the impact of that
[01:51] velocity, but realistically, teams that have high velocity are able to
[01:55] actually get to that impact over time by iterating.
[01:58] It's also a great way to have positive selection in terms of like talent,
[02:02] because talent wants to join companies that ship fast.
[02:05] A lot of people who join ramp, I asked them, you know, why
[02:07] you're interested in joining the company.
[02:08] And they often say, well, it's because you guys are actually
[02:11] building things and shipping things.
[02:12] And I want to know what that feels like.
[02:15] And it's also a great way to just de-risk decisions and decision
[02:17] making, if the cost of that decision is really low, then you're
[02:21] able to essentially simplify a lot of decisions to build on that.
[02:25] There's a lot of companies that say they move fast, that talk about moving.
