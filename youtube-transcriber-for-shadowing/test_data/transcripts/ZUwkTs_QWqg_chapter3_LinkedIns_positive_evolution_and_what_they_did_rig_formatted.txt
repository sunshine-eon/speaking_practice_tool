============================================================

It's very kind of you. Yeah, okay, so let's roll into some stuff. I actually want to start with LinkedIn as a platform broadly. I know you don't work on all parts of LinkedIn and don't necessarily know everything that's going on there, but something I've noticed that's pretty major is it feels like LinkedIn's really made this move from being a very cringy place to post and spend time to actually now being interesting. The feed that I see on LinkedIn is interesting, oftentimes even more interesting than Twitter, which is crazy to say. Also, it's become the biggest source of traffic for my newsletter, more so than Twitter, which I never expected. 

So my question is, as far as you know, what is it that y'all did right in the past couple of years that has allowed for this shift to happen? Because this was very rare. Well, first, I'm glad you're having a good experience with it, and that's really, really kind to hear. So first of all, it's very interesting. You kind of hit on it. Everything at LinkedIn is a very connected ecosystem. One of the things that we always think about is how the whole system fits together. I'm sure we'll get into it more and more about how we build at LinkedIn, but how you make decisions based on that very complicated ecosystem is actually not very difficult because we're all here to help people connect to economic opportunity. 

Every time there's a discussion, something I'm really, really proud about working here is everyone knows how that decision is gonna be made. It's all about how we connect people with economic opportunity. Now, it was funny, just the other day I was driving in an Uber with the person who runs the feed, this guy Kim Rush, who's just phenomenal. We were just talking about this. One of the things he mentioned to me was, if you think about what a feed is when it connects someone to opportunity, it's gotta do a couple of things really, really well. We've done a ton of member surveys on this and put a lot of thought behind it. 

The first is, as you make relationship connections across the way, that is a real way by which people get opportunity. They keep in touch with those people, they learn, and they might follow someone in hopes of getting known to them and gaining that knowledge. We gotta make sure that content is getting to them. Then when you think outside the network, we have to ensure that the things that people really want, which they keep saying are knowledge and advice, and the ability to get the real perspectives they need, are available. Those are the things out of network they want. We've really, really been focused on driving those two systems: how does someone connect to opportunity both through the people and through the content that they actually want? 

As you know, when you do a feed, there are so many decisions that go into that complex system. But we've been really, really trying to make sure that we don't lose sight of that and start tuning all those knobs in the right direction. So if we're trying to get even more specific with what has changed, clearly there's been a focus internally. Is that true? There's just like, "Hey, let's make this feed a lot more interesting," or is this just a never-ending investment that has actually started to work, as far as you know? 

Well, there's always been a focus on connecting people to opportunity, right? There's always been a focus on that. I think what's happened over time is we've gotten more and more clear with what our members really want, which is this ability to feel close to those relationships and the ability to really get that knowledge that they need. As we've gotten better and clearer in that understanding, we've been able to dial the knobs in the right way. I hope it's landing in the right place. 

I'm always kind of hesitant to declare victory in any part of this product. One of the beauties of working with that vision of connecting people to opportunity is that there is always some piece of friction. There is always something we could be doing better. I'm always hesitant to say we've ever hit that bar. I know there are probably people who listen to you who may not have had that experience, and I always encourage them to reach out and let us know ways we can do better. But I'm glad you're having a positive experience with it. To your point, I always feel that as long as we stay focused on that and each of our decisions start moving in that direction, hopefully the product will continue to deliver.
