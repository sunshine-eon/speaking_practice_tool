[00:00] Abrams. Archie, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.
[00:08] Thanks, Lenny, excited to be here. Okay, so what I want to do with our time together is to basically
[00:13] do kind of a living archaeology of how Shopify grows and what you specifically have learned
[00:20] about growing a company like Shopify into this just juggernaut of a business that it's turned
[00:26] into to give people a little bit of a sense of just like how large Shopify has gotten,
[00:31] so maybe surprising them about the scale of this company at this point.
[00:34] Could you share some stats about the scale of the business at this point?
[00:39] Yeah, absolutely. So overall, we're about 10% of e-commerce in the United States.
[00:44] So basically, if you're not buying an Amazon or Walmart, you're probably buying on a Shopify
[00:50] powered store. And behind the scenes globally, we did about 235 billion in GMV in 2023, which is
[00:59] roughly the size of the economy of Finland. So we've got a big economy and big impact
[01:05] happening from Shopify. Wow. I think interestingly with Shopify, it's kind of this behind-the-scenes
[01:12] tool. And so I imagine many people have no idea they're using Shopify a lot of the time when
[01:16] they're buying stuff online. And I think some of these numbers kind of creep up on people
[01:20] with just how large a company like Shopify has gotten. 100%.
