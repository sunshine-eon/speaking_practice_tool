============================================================

So on this thread, I didn't realize Luis reviews everything you're planning to change. This may be the answer to the question I was going to ask, which is one of the criticisms of running a product and company this way—experimenting constantly with all these micro-improvements and changes. It can lead to something like a monstrosity of a product and experience that isn't consistent and cohesive. Often, that happens. Is the solution to that having the founder basically review all the changes? Is there anything else you all do to avoid it moving into becoming a farm bill or whatever? It's a good example.

Yeah, our product review structure includes our head of product design, one of the lead product management leaders, and then Luis. Because they see everything, they have a really high product bar, and that helps. Over time, we as PMs have to look at where our feature is headed. We do this with the streak at least on a quarterly basis to evaluate what we have learned, how our streak has developed, and how we imagine this going in the future. I don't think it's easy to do, and it can end in some sort of awful local maxima if you're not constantly looking at your roadmap and thinking strategically. For me, if you have a clear strategy for where your feature is going, hopefully, all of those A/B tests are not just done to get some cheap gain; they're done with a long-term goal in mind.

I do think, though, that eventually you just hit a local maxima. You mentioned launching neutral experiments, which is a great example. At that point, we need to throw a bunch of this stuff out based on all the learnings. Can we reset this real estate, reset this UI, and reset this feature in such a way that is just as good as what we have now but is way more plain or simple? This allows us to layer on improvements again. Those are hard experiments to win, obviously, because they are so optimized, but they're really important to do. Otherwise, you just end up with a kitchen sink of a feature.

One other tidbit I want to mention is that the advantage you all have that other companies don't is that people want to learn. They want to learn the language, and getting pushed to come back to an app for something they want to do is not an advantage a lot of products have. So, is there anything you want to add about why Duolingo might be a little different from what you're working on?

I mean, that is definitely a benefit. If I had an app that encouraged streaks, this is actually why I think a lot of mobile games do streaks differently. To say that you played a mobile game for 3,000 days in a row hits differently than saying you've learned Spanish for 3,000 days in a row. The comparison set is much larger than a lot of companies give themselves credit for. There are very few companies out there saying they don't do some degree of good for their users. Even in a game, you're giving someone a moment away from the craziness of their lives.

I do think it's contingent on companies figuring out if a streak works for them and how to frame the streak in a way that makes a user feel good about it. It's easier for Duolingo, but I think there are creative ways to phrase this for users. 

Another point is that the streak works really well for Duolingo because, with language learning, it's hard to see day-to-day progress in becoming more fluent. Fluency isn't even the right word; it's about becoming better at Spanish or whatever language. It's a years-long process to get better at a language. Duolingo makes it easier, but you still have to put in thousands of hours to reach C1 or C2 fluency. That's really hard to track on a day-to-day basis. 

The streak works well for us because we might not be able to tell you, "Hey, you now know 0.01% more Spanish," but we can show you, "Hey, you've gotten your streak a little bit higher." This works particularly well when you're an app doing something that will be sensed or felt over a longer term, helping to contextualize that progress in a way that makes more sense or feels more tangible to a user. 

Great. That was a great context and empowering for a lot of companies that aren't necessarily doing language learning.
