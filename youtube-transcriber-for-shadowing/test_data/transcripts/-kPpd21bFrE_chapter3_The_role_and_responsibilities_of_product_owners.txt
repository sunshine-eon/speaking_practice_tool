============================================================

[00:00] Wow. Okay, cool. So let's get into the what you've learned about building an amazing product team and also hiring an amazing product team.
[00:07] So first of all, you call your product managers product owners. And when we were chatting through initially, I was like, oh, I see it's just like a big scrum business and they just have always product owners who, you know, many times on this podcast, people have talked about that's not actually a product manager, but that's not at all how you work.
[00:22] So in this context, product owners, an actual owner, talk about just the kind of the story behind why you call them your product managers product owners.
[00:30] Yeah, it's not a scrum term for us. It's just our take on emphasizing how ownership is important really. So product owners are central to company and its growth.
[00:42] They end to end responsible for the product for this part of the business and for their customers to be happy.
[00:53] And for that, they do really everything. They run the teams. They define which roadmap we need to build to improve certain business metrics.
[01:08] And they also contribute to like high level company strategy. But then most importantly, they execute on it relentlessly.
[01:18] And they are ultimately responsible for the product to be shipped and achieve results.
[01:26] There's always this term of mini co pms and mini co and it feels like in your context, that's actually what you try to do with your product team is they're essentially mini CEOs.
[01:33] They have a lot of power. Like I think engineers, designers report to them. Is that right?
[01:37] Yeah, correct. Well, I prefer say local CEO.
[01:40] Local CEO. Okay, yeah, yeah.
[01:43] Yeah, but that's true. So the way we operate, we have these fully cross functional teams.
[01:53] Me and they are stuffed with all necessary functions, engineers, data analysts, designers, operation managers and so on.
[02:00] And we also operate in a metrics. So everyone has a line manager and a functional manager.
[02:10] So product owner is always the line manager for everyone on the team.
[02:15] Meaning product owner defines what they need to do.
[02:20] But then functional managers, they define how these things need to be built and essentially with the right level of quality and so on.
