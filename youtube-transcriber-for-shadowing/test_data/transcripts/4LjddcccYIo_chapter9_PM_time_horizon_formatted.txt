Chapter 9: PM time horizon
Video: Mastering product strategy and growing as a PM | Maggie Crowley (Toast, Drift, TripAdvisor)
Time: 23:23 - 26:31
============================================================

I love that point. It reminds me of what I find to be one of the most important traits of a great product manager: they create this aura that they've got this. They put something on their plate and they're not going to drop it, that the threads are not going to be forgotten. This connects to me; they feel like Maggie's going to tell me what happened with this experiment. I don't have to think about it as a manager.

That's a really good point. Then you mentioned this a little bit ago; the side benefit is that you learn more. You'll go back and learn why something happened or why it didn't happen. The more that you follow up on what you've been doing and the more you learn, the better you get every time you ship something. To me, the other answer of what makes a great PM is the PM who's shipped a lot of stuff. The more you ship, the more you learn, and that's why it can take years to build up expertise because you just have to ship a lot of stuff.

There are a lot of people who are always frustrated. They're not getting promoted quickly enough as a PM; they're not moving up the ladder. Oh my God, I've been a PM for two years. I'm not a senior PM yet. Can you speak more to just that thought and just how long it takes to get actually good? I guess I'll share briefly in my experience. It took me four years to actually know what the hell I was doing as a PM, and then things started to really take off. What's your experience?

I would say similarly, it took a lot of years to feel confident that I knew what I was doing. My first PM job was a product management rotation job at TripAdvisor. I had no PM background. I was after business school, and I left those two years thinking, like, yeah, I've worked on four different teams over the two years. I've shipped all this stuff. Like, I'm good. I went to a startup. There was another product person there. They left, and then I was the only product person at the startup. I realized really quickly I had no idea what I was doing. I had no one to learn from. I had only had two years of experience, and I was not ready for that job. I didn't feel confident in the decisions I was making.

That's why I joined Drift, because that team had all these really incredible product thinkers on it, and they were shipping all sorts of stuff. They had all this momentum, and I thought, okay, that's where I'm going to go to learn. Then two more years. That's five years until I really felt like I knew what I was doing. That's because it takes a long time to ship stuff.

To people who want to progress, you can progress by job hopping. You can progress by going in and out of startups. But to me, staying at Drift—when I was there for almost four years—I got to see two or three cycles of the same product. I learned more from that than I did out of the year or so I spent doing other things each at a time because you got to see the consequences of your decisions. That's rare, and people, myself included, of course you want to get promoted. Of course you want to move up. I'm ambitious; lots of people are ambitious. But for better or for worse, spending the time is really helpful, and I think it allowed me to move faster later because I had just spent the time grinding it out for a while in order to be better later.
