Awesome. So I've never heard of a version of this with so much depth into the landscape. I think that's so smart because so much of conflict and disagreement comes from not having the same information. The manager, exec, or whoever doesn't think you have the information. So if you lean into sharing everything that you know and what's happening, it opens the door for discussion. If someone disagrees with the goal, they can tell you in the middle of the plan change.

Part of it is that, typically speaking, when you're doing a strategy, you're doing it at a higher level. I don't think every product needs a strategy, and every feature doesn't need a strategy, for example. You don't need to do this if you're working on a tiny slice of a product and you have user feedback. Don't overcomplicate it; just do the stuff that makes sense. But especially as I've gotten more senior in my career, the questions are bigger, the impact is broader, and the timelines are longer. Honestly, I wanted to get it right. I didn't want to make a bet on something, put a bunch of resources against a problem, and get it wrong.

This was also homework that I wanted to do for myself to ensure I was doing the right thing. For some reason, I'm always paranoid that other people have more information or are doing it better than I am. So I thought, okay, I have to write it all down, make sure I got it right, and share it with everyone to ensure they agreed with me so that I didn't screw this thing up. It was such a useful exercise that I kept doing it. Of course, people don't read it; they only read a tiny section. You'll run into the same problems you have with everything else, but at least I knew I had done the work and that people cared to engage with it. It was there.

On those lines, I was going to ask, how long do you find this should be depending on the time scale? Say you're doing a quarterly strategy or a year; how many pages should this document be? Any guidance? It's long. It gets really long. Like, what is long? I've had some documents that go 20 pages just because if you really want to get deep into a competitor or interesting market dynamics, it can get extensive. Sometimes I'm screenshotting other companies' marketing websites and dumping that in there, which might be some interesting content. 

It doesn't have to just be words; it can include all kinds of different things that you might want to put in there. You made the point that it's not like you expect people to read this whole thing. There's a summary that gives them a conclusion, and in theory, if they want to really dig into it, they can. But how do you find that balance of writing everything you know and making it so long that no one's ever going to read it, versus making it actually useful to someone while including a summary?

It comes back to the reason why I write the document in the first place, and that's for me. It's my homework to do my job effectively. I just make sure to share it. I find that especially my engineering and design counterparts, if you're working in a true triad, will almost always engage really deeply on the document because they're also on the line. They want to ensure that when they sign their teams up to do whatever it is, they believe in the thing you're working on. I find that those people will engage pretty deeply. Sometimes you'll have more junior folks on the team who'll get really into it too. 

Then there are some people who'll skim the upfront part and either say, "Yeah, that looks great," or "I hate this." And that's okay. There's always those people. So it never really mattered to me that people read the whole thing. It was more about knowing I had to do it to be confident in my own decisions, which allowed me to facilitate a conversation, so it didn't really matter.

This episode is brought to you by Epo. Epo is a next-generation AB testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Muro, ClickUp, and DraftKings rely on Epo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and understanding the performance of new features. Epo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does.

When I was at Airbnb, one of the things I valued most was our experimentation platform, where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Epo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shape weeks off experiment time, an accessible UI for diving deeper into performance, and out-of-the-box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles. Epo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the AB testing flywheel. Epo powers experimentation across every use case, including product, growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing. Check out Epo at GetEpo.com slash Lenny and 10x your experiment velocity. That's GetEPPO.com slash Lenny.

Was there an example of a strategy you were thinking about recently or that you worked on in the past to give people something concrete of what you think about when developing a strategy? Yeah, I think this is where product content gets really challenging because I obviously can't really talk about the stuff I'm currently working on. Just tell us all of the secrets, and nobody will know! The Toast PR department would be really unhappy with me. 

It's questions like, if you're a director of product somewhere, maybe you're running a section of a business and it's annual planning. We're in Q4. What are you going to do next year? How do you answer that question? What do you put in? How do you back up your choices for that? You use a document like this. Maybe you realize that the product you're working on doesn't really matter; it's not really making an impact, and you're kind of treading water. I would use this as a tool to figure out, okay, well, what else could you do? So yeah, quarterly planning, annual planning, if you feel like your team needs to make a pivot, or if you think there's a really interesting new opportunity that your business or your team should go after is another time I might use something like this.
