[00:00] Okay, so on cred, so there's a funny thing that happened. I asked people on Twitter what
[00:05] questions to ask you on this podcast. And one of the most common questions was, when do
[00:09] you think you'll become profitable? Which is interesting because when I have other CEOs
[00:14] that are founding a company that is in most companies, aren't you profitable? Nobody's
[00:17] asking that question. So I'm just curious why? Why is that such a common question that
[00:22] comes up?
[00:23] Fascinating. It's fascinating. As a country, most businesses are trading. You buy something
[00:31] at low cost, sell at a higher price, and you make profit. Most of our businesses, most
[00:37] of our family businesses were trading. But building a capex-heavy distribution, monetizing
[00:44] it later on, focusing on high revenue growth rate versus trying to get profitability first
[00:49] is not known to us. So when they see these large numbers of losses, there's a shock that
[00:58] why would somebody give you this kind of money? And then, by the way, my own dad wouldn't
[01:03] respect me till I was a profitable company. So it's not surprising that people in India
[01:08] have these comments. But it also comes from not understanding how businesses are built
[01:14] in an internet world where VCs are giving you the capital to build distribution,
[01:18] unique product, edge, brand, all of that stuff, and then monetize later on and monetize big
[01:25] and then have very large profit pools to go after. But a lot of times, this comes from
[01:32] not understanding this business. And I feel it'll change because many internet companies
[01:38] are now getting very profitable, public listed. So we'll have a decade, let's understand
[01:45] one thing. In the US, maybe 27, 30% of US market cap is now tech companies. India tech
[01:52] companies would probably make less than 2%, 3% of the market cap. So we are mostly, and
[01:59] I'm not saying India has this fabulous history of building very, very profitable tech companies.
[02:02] We are probably the first generation that will have to prove ourselves to be very
[02:06] large profitable companies. But we are still figuring out what this means. And the
[02:11] fact that this question, by the way, I can tell you one thing that I have been asked this
[02:15] question by people on Twitter way more than my any of my investors ever asked me this
[02:20] question, which also creates an arbitrage for entrepreneurs who can actually build
[02:24] businesses and ability to raise capital and improve their business model with very
[02:29] revenue, high gross, high revenue gross rate and build large brands and so on and so
[02:33] forth. But I find fascinating as well. Also, what one thing you'll see fascinating
[02:39] in India is that there is like immense amount of trolling and doubt that will come in your
[02:45] comments. No matter what you do. So if you see any founder in India, they'll post
[02:49] something about the thing, the comments will rarely have appreciation. So it feels sad
[02:58] because when you see global companies do stuff like India will lose their shit on
[03:02] Apple Vision Pro and all this stuff and like the Twitter will go Gaga over it.
[03:06] But I think when it comes to and I believe envy is hyper local. We do not envy Elon Musk
[03:15] for all the stuff he does because he's so far away. But we envy our own because
[03:21] they were just like us not many years ago. And therefore, envy is like Wi-Fi. It's
[03:28] like a
