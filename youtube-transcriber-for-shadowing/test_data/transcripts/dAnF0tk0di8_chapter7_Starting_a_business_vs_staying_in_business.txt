============================================================

[00:00] we have. You have this term you holds instead of a startup, it's a stay up. Yes. I'm so sick
[00:05] of the startups. I mean, like it's cool to start a business, obviously, but I'm sick of the like
[00:10] that term dominating. Because frankly, starting a business is actually way easier than staying in
[00:17] business. Now, none of it's easy. So I want to like be supportive of people who are starting
[00:22] businesses, but just they should know that that's actually not the hard part. I mean,
[00:27] literally tomorrow I can start a new business. You can come up with a name and you can make a
[00:30] thing and you can put in the app store and you can sell for two bucks and like you got a business
[00:33] going, right? But are you going to be there in two years? Are you going to be there in five years
[00:38] when competition rushes in? When you have employees, are you going to be there? Staying
[00:42] is harder than starting. And so I'm here to celebrate stay ups. Plenty of other people
[00:47] are here to celebrate startups. I feel the same way with it. I always say this about
[00:52] newsletters and it's also true for podcasts. Easy to start a newsletter, hard to keep it going.
[00:56] Totally. Yeah. I mean, I've seen your newsletter kind of, you know, fly, right? And we have,
[01:01] we have a newsletter and like it's been pretty like flat. I'm like, how does he do it? It's hard.
[01:06] It's really hard. It's hard to build a podcast audience. It's hard to build a newsletter
[01:10] audience. So yeah, starting something is really easy, but then you're going to end up in this,
[01:13] most people end up in this plateau area because they get some initial growth, the word gets out,
[01:19] whatever. And they end up with like a 6,000 somethings. And then you're kind of like
[01:23] stuck there. And then it's like, well, do you want to keep doing this? Were you just high on the
[01:27] growth or do you actually like the thing? And you've got to, if you want to do the thing for a
[01:33] long period of time, you've got to like the thing because you're going to have to, you know,
[01:36] endure these moments of plateaus, which is, you know, kind of what staying up is all about.
[01:42] And sometimes those go down. I mean, like we've had wavy years, right? Always been
[01:45] profitable, but our profits different every year. And sometimes it's more and sometimes
[01:49] it's less and sometimes our margin is more and sometimes it's less. You know,
[01:52] if you compare yourself to the previous year, you can kind of like get the moralized to some
[01:56] degree. But like, I just kind of like, what do we want to keep doing? And then,
[01:59] and then we're in it to stay in it.
