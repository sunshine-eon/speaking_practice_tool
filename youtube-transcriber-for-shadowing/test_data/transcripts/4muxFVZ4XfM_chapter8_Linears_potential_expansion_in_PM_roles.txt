============================================================

[00:00] or something.
[00:01] Just one more question along these lines.
[00:03] There's other companies like Stripe,
[00:04] I think waited till 200 employees to hire.
[00:06] I think their first product manager, Snapchat,
[00:09] I think is famous for something around that.
[00:11] Do you have any sense of if you think this might change
[00:14] when you think you might hire more product managers
[00:16] that are kind of planned here
[00:17] or is it just kind of see how it goes as you grow?
[00:19] I think we will definitely hire more.
[00:21] It's like, I think like what I said before,
[00:23] it's like, I think we like to see in the BM smarts
[00:26] like operating on a higher level.
[00:28] Like the whole company, like,
[00:29] I think the way we try to build it is like,
[00:32] we have less people,
[00:33] but people who are more high caliber
[00:36] and can think about like larger scope
[00:40] than what their current role is.
[00:43] So I think like it's,
[00:44] we're just like trying to build this like a smaller units,
[00:48] but more effective units,
[00:49] which I think like where the PMs go
[00:51] and that they would be also less of them.
[00:54] Like, and they're not there at every level.
[00:56] But I think in the future as the company grows
[00:58] and the team grows and the product grows,
[01:01] we might have like several PMs that are focusing on
[01:04] or looking at specific areas
[01:05] or specific types of things of the product
[01:08] or specific customers or something like that.
[01:11] Awesome.
