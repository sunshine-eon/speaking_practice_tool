============================================================

That's what I imagined you were going to say, and I love hearing that. For someone that wants to create a similar culture, is there tactically anything you find to understand if your employees and engineers, designers have enough of that context and really understand the problem? 

I think it's always different people; different people in a company will have different understandings. It's not like you can expect everyone to go see everything every day and have this shared context. But we do sometimes hold sessions with the team, or we record videos with the customers. We write notes and share these with people. I feel like, again, it's fairly apparent if people know their customers are the product. It's a very different way you can talk about it versus if you don't have any idea. If you don't have any idea, you probably don't even know what to say. 

I think it's apparent that people have that understanding. It's not like every project requires everyone to have this level of understanding; it's usually enough if one or two people have that understanding or have different understandings of different things. I think, again, it's a culture thing. 

The other thing is you kind of have to believe in it. Sometimes people rely on data a lot or too much because they're worried or afraid that they might make a wrong choice. They use data to make the choice for them. But then you might still feel like this is not the right choice, even though the data suggests it is. It turns out maybe it was the right choice or not, but it's more about practice. 

You need to be okay with the fact that sometimes we make mistakes. We've made the wrong choice, and then we can just fix it. At least we made that choice, and the data didn't make that choice for us.
