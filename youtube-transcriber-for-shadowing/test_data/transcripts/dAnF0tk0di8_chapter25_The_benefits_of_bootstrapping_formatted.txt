I want to touch on linear. It's interesting that you guys have a lot of similar philosophies. What is it about project management and task management software that creates this sort of approach to business? That's maybe one question if there's something there. 

The other point is that it feels like they have a lot of similar philosophies. Growth isn't a focus; it's more of an instinct. They have paid work trials, they're very profitable, and they don't spend a lot of time around VC money. Do you have a feeling like this approach could work in the venture route? Do you see them as maybe an example of, "Hey, maybe you could adopt a lot of these things and also raise money"? Maybe there's another direction here? 

Yeah, I mean, I don't know enough about them to comment on. I've heard some about them, and it sounds like they have some similar points of view. Where those came from, I don't know. Maybe they materialized from somewhere, maybe they picked them up from someone else, or maybe they came up with them themselves. It's nice to hear that other people are trying some of these things and that it's working for them. 

Now, regarding the VC route, the idea of having too much money doesn't mean you can't work efficiently and thoughtfully. However, it does create a degree of sloppiness because you don't have to. When you don't have to—when you don't have to make money, when you don't have to be efficient, when you don't have to be profitable—you just kind of get sloppy. 

In fact, they need to spend the money. They didn't give us the money to save it and earn 6% interest, which would be great now. Three years ago, it was 0% interest. They didn't give us the money to sit in the bank; they gave it to someone to spend. We're going to spend it on two things: people and marketing. We can buy more ads, do more of this, do more of that, hire more people, build up more teams, and do more things simultaneously. There’s a certain sloppiness in that. 

I think it just becomes harder when the environment encourages sloppiness. This is why I think the value in bootstrapping is that it teaches entrepreneurs—or rather, it forces them—to figure out how to make money. The more time they spend under the curve making money and practicing making money, the better they’re going to get at it. 

I use the guitar metaphor often. If I give you a guitar and ask you to go up on stage and play, you're going to suck. It’s going to be horribly embarrassing, and you’re going to be terrible at it. You might still be terrible a month later, but you’ll be slightly better at it. If you do it for six months or a year, you’re going to improve, and in five years, you’re going to be really damn good, right? 

So, why do we think that a business that is sloppy and doesn't have to make its own money can suddenly turn on the profit spigot and be profitable? What you see is that they often cannot because they’re just not set up that way. They’ve never played guitar before, and now they’re being asked to play guitar. 

The reason I think it's great for entrepreneurs to start bootstrapping is that they gain more practice making money. They get better and better at the fundamental skill needed to turn a business into a success, which is to make money. If you don't have to do that from the start, you're just not practicing that. Instead, you're practicing spending money, and getting good at spending money is not as valuable a skill as getting good at making money. That’s why I think it’s just harder, but of course, it’s possible. It’s just harder.
