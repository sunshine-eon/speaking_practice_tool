============================================================

[00:00] This remote work example, something I definitely wanted to touch on, which is, I'm glad you got there.
[00:04] So in this decision, is there anything more you could share about how you got to that place of like,
[00:09] oh, this Boolean changed. So we should rethink this. Because I know what you probably,
[00:13] I don't know, were you in the shower and just like, oh, wow, we should really
[00:17] go remote because of this. How did that actually come about? And then I went.
[00:20] Yeah, I like that. Pretty much actually, yes. Because again, I rerun over all the inputs
[00:28] and figure out what happens. And here's a couple of other things that we're starting to fray on the
[00:34] decision to be in person as well. We started in Ottawa, Canada, which is a city of a million people.
[00:43] And it has some tech heritage and good universities. But at a million people,
[00:50] you're not, it's just not population dense enough and has a depth of talent pool
[01:00] that it can support a company that was going to 10,000 people. So anyone who runs this
[01:05] optimization function I'm talking about here about location strategy for a new startup
[01:10] will come to the conclusion, if I do it right, that everyone should be sitting around the same
[01:15] table. Only if you can't do that, do you say, okay, let's be all in the same couple of rooms.
[01:22] Only if that doesn't work anymore, you say, okay, let's be spread over one floor. If that
[01:26] doesn't work in the same building, if that doesn't work in the same city, if that doesn't work,
[01:30] at least stay in the same time zones, right? Like, or make sure that there's good hub
[01:34] connections between like, this is how it works, right? It's just like some assumption
[01:38] somewhere along the line is invalidated, if you end up in a different side of a decision tree.
[01:43] But what was happening to us was we already were in like four, five cities, we were adhering to the
[01:49] same time zone point at this point. But I have my experience was I went through sometimes at the
[01:56] Ottawa office for an entire day, we had like 10 hours of meetings, which is, you know,
[02:01] kind of fairly normal. But like, I do every single, I don't think I had a single other person
[02:09] sometimes with me, because every one of them was with people in another office, some people
[02:15] dying in remote and so on. So there was like, like an awkward hybridness, which we ended up in
[02:22] making only good decisions along the way. This is actually the most dangerous thing.
[02:26] Like, most of the time you end up in a bad part of a tree in a bad in a local maxima of
[02:31] a path dependent environment, by only making good choices. People think that like,
[02:36] making a good choice inoculates you from ending from making mistakes, or that the presence of a
[02:43] kind of downside of an idea ends up disqualifying the idea of both those things are incorrect. So
[02:49] what you need to do then is so like that was an overlay to the decision. The moment COVID started
[02:57] then, we also had this thing of shopkeepers exploding because we were actually like an asset
[03:02] to people doing COVID commerce for the local businesses. And we took that very, very seriously
[03:07] trying to make more businesses survive COVID, small businesses survive this particular calamity
[03:13] than otherwise would, which is important because small businesses tend to be wiped out first
[03:18] anytime the times turn fragile. And so we needed to staff up. And so there's a very
[03:26] real question about where to stuff up. So clearly, the better input there would be if you could
[03:33] hire people everywhere. And so like once that decision flipped,
[03:41] you can see how this is actually now super easy to say we are going to be remote, right?
[03:46] Because there is no turning back. There is no like even with this decision, it's a better set
[03:51] of trade offs for the future is to accept the vast additional difficulty of building a remote
[03:57] company. It's way harder. It's not something you should recommend to anyone to do this because
[04:06] it's the same as trying to run a world record marathon run in Aspen, Colorado. It's like,
[04:13] there's not enough oxygen up there to do that. But if you end up putting it off,
[04:19] you're real chat, right? That's pretty cool. So I find difficulty itself interesting. And
[04:26] again, I spent enough of my teenage years on the internet to know that there's amazing
[04:31] cultures that can be put together purely remote like, I know, Wikipedia, Word of Warcraft,
[04:37] Raiding Guilds have, you know, at least have excellence cultures. And so we're like, okay,
[04:44] cool. Let's rederive or like, let's come to a new stable part that stable part was don't port
[04:50] the office online. Let's port the internet into a company. And then we're like, let's go.
