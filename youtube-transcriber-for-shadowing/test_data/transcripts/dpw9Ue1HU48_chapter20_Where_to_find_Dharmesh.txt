[00:00] That is really beautiful. Darmesh, you are wonderful.
[00:04] Thank you so much for doing this.
[00:06] This has been a lot of fun. I'm glad we were able to put together.
[00:09] Same. We covered so much ground.
[00:11] We got through everything that I was hoping to get through and more.
[00:14] Working folks finding online if they want to follow what you're up to
[00:17] and maybe reach out if they have questions,
[00:18] and then how can listeners be useful to you?
[00:20] Sure. I'm Darmesh, D-H-A-R-M-E-S-H everywhere.
[00:24] Not only findable, I'm unavoidable on the Internet,
[00:28] as it turns out.
[00:30] Follow me on social media and tell me where I'm being an idiot when I can learn.
[00:36] Tell me your favorite ideas.
[00:38] Leave a YouTube comment and tell me which Lenny episodes were your favorite
[00:43] so I can go back because I've been binge watching anyway.
[00:46] I'd love to know.
[00:47] And then speaking of that, I know you have websites of your content.
[00:51] You have your YouTube channel. Working folks find those things.
[00:54] Yeah, if you just go to Darmesh.com,
[00:57] I'll have links to the other places.
[00:59] And probably most often on LinkedIn, as it turns out,
[01:02] which is a whole topic for a whole other day.
[01:05] But yeah, awesome.
[01:07] All right, I'll let you go.
