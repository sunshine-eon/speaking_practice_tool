============================================================

[00:00] Yeah, that is so unique and I rarely hear of a company being able to hire that way.
[00:04] I imagine one of the reasons you can get away with that where people are like,
[00:07] don't have a full-time job for a while while we're doing a paid trial is because linear is such a
[00:12] enticing place to work. I imagine for a lot of companies they can't really do that,
[00:15] but I guess any thoughts on just maybe more companies can actually pull this off.
[00:20] Yeah, I mean, I think it's always like, if you don't ask, like you don't know, like,
[00:23] I think like in our case, we that's just being the standard and we try to work with the
[00:29] candidate, like, let's figure out maybe we do it on the weekend or maybe we do it some other
[00:33] like a vacation holiday or something. So there can be ways we can like,
[00:37] schedule it so that it causes as little kind of problems to the candidate as possible.
[00:45] And I think we only had like, only a few people probably have ever declined it.
[00:49] Like it's it's not like, I think everyone else has been, at least after the fact,
[00:54] they've been happy that they did it because they felt like they had a much better
[00:58] sense of the company that they're joining. And then also like doing that
[01:01] work drop, they can actually join our meetings, they take it access to our slack and notion.
[01:06] And they also have one on one chats with the rest of the like some of the other people on the team.
[01:12] So they already get to know people. So it's a good way for them to like evaluate us as well.
[01:18] And then for us, it's obviously we can see like, what is important for us to see is like,
[01:22] how does this person operate in this kind of environment? And like, how do they
[01:27] approach problems? Like, how do they think? And like, are they able to make progress in a very
[01:32] short timeframe, which I always think is like, very important for startups. Like,
[01:36] in a large companies, you have maybe all the time in the world to do stuff. But I think, like,
[01:40] you know, any kind of startup, even even with us, when we like take our time doing things,
[01:44] sometimes it's still important. Like, we can do things quickly if we have to.
[01:49] Super cool. Just to close the thread on product sensibilities,
[01:53] there anything you could share of just how you actually help understand someone's strengths and
[01:57] inability there?
[01:58] Yeah, I wouldn't say like we have like some kind of very scientific or some like special way
[02:05] figure it out for this. So I think it's a lot of it's like a it's like a discussion
[02:09] of and I often think like ask people that like, we can ask about their projects and I try to go
[02:16] deeper. It's like, why was this decision made? Like, why do you think the decision was made? And
[02:21] like, I might ask, like, do you think it was the right decision? And like, or do you
[02:26] did you agree on it? Or ask me like, what do you think you would have done done differently?
[02:32] Or something. So I think it's more like, I'm trying to see if they do, do they have thoughts
[02:38] in this area? And like, what their answers is. And people's answers can be very like,
[02:42] different levels, like some people might be, yeah, just like, I didn't like it,
[02:47] which I don't like, yeah, it's an opinion, but it's not based on anything. It's just like,
[02:51] you didn't like it, you should be able to expand on it saying like,
[02:55] well, I don't like it, because in this case, like, it would not work well for this kind of
[03:00] users or in this kind of context or for this kind of purposes. So they have like more of
[03:06] this like reasoning, or some kind of rationale, like why they think this way. And they can articulate
[03:14] that. So I think that's like kind of like what I'm, we often like testing for us, is like, can they,
[03:20] can they do this? And how well they can do it? And it's, it's going to be like very,
[03:25] yeah, they're going to be like very wide ranges of how people
[03:29] do it. And when, when you see someone who really thinks about this stuff, it's very
[03:33] clear to see that they can just like talk about it forever. And they can go deeper and deeper.
[03:38] And then some people that maybe don't haven't had the experience or don't think this way,
[03:43] they're like, yeah, I know, I don't really know, like I just, I just build it and then seem fine.
