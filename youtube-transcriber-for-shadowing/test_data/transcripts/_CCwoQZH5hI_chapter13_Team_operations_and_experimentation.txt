Chapter 13: Team operations and experimentation
Video: Behind the product: Duolingo streaks | Jackson Shuttleworth (Group PM, Retention Team)
Time: 64:47 - 78:57
============================================================

[00:00] we've done along the journey.
[00:01] I'm gonna shift to talking about how your team operates.
[00:05] So there's a lot of threads you touch on
[00:08] of just how a team can do this so well.
[00:11] Shift 600 experiments, as you said.
[00:14] Continue to find opportunity.
[00:16] What are some maybe lessons or advice
[00:18] you'd have for folks that are like,
[00:20] oh, wow, I wanna work more like this
[00:22] from your team's experience.
[00:24] How do you use your team to operate
[00:25] that folks can learn?
[00:26] Yeah, maybe just a little bit of context.
[00:27] We're, Duolingo cares a lot about metrics.
[00:30] So most of our teams are metric-based teams.
[00:32] So we do the most work with Streak,
[00:36] but the metric what we really care about
[00:38] at the end of the day is Kerr,
[00:40] and DAUs because we see that DAUs hit Kerr.
[00:42] And so when you can be really laser focused
[00:46] on my goal each quarter is to make this metric go up,
[00:49] I think it's much easier to make sure
[00:52] that you're working on the highest ROI thing.
[00:54] I think when you think more about like,
[00:56] oh, I wanna make this feature better,
[00:58] I think it's easier to get lost in what better means
[01:01] and how you think about better.
[01:02] And so I do think that like having a really strong
[01:05] degree of focus as a team on what is the metric
[01:09] that I'm caring about and how is that directing my efforts?
[01:11] Versus feature oriented.
[01:13] So basically your teams are structured around
[01:15] a metric slash a goal slash outcome
[01:18] versus we own this feature or this product.
[01:20] Retention owns Streak, I guess,
[01:23] but that's only because we've seen Streak drive Kerr
[01:28] better than any feature, but we are not,
[01:31] I mean, we have this IAP hook with our Streak Freeze purchases.
[01:36] There are other teams that work on,
[01:38] that can and have worked on the Streak
[01:40] because it's not ours to say,
[01:41] no, no, we do all the iterations here.
[01:44] We just know that it drives our metric better
[01:46] in the same way that like leaderboards,
[01:49] we have a team that focuses on how much time you spent,
[01:51] we want users to spend more time on Duolingo
[01:52] so they're learning more.
[01:53] Leaderboards is the best vector for doing it.
[01:55] So that team does a lot of leaderboards work,
[01:57] but every now and then I have an idea
[01:59] that I think will be highly retentive
[02:00] and I will go in and I will pitch to them
[02:01] and then we'll do some change to the leaderboard
[02:03] to make it more retentive.
[02:05] And so, but I do think having that clear metric
[02:08] of we're trying to drive Kerr,
[02:10] not we're trying to just make this feature better,
[02:12] helps at least make sure,
[02:15] give the team clear marching orders
[02:16] and that focus I think is really good
[02:18] for prioritizing backlog.
[02:20] Cool, this is a really important point.
[02:21] This is the same way Airbnb worked
[02:23] when I worked there for a long time
[02:24] is it's, here's a goal that we want your team
[02:27] to be responsible for.
[02:28] You can work on any product you need to hit this goal.
[02:33] As you said, often like various products
[02:35] are most connected to what you're doing,
[02:37] but what you're describing is like,
[02:39] even though teams kind of,
[02:40] like I imagine you own it from a bug perspective
[02:43] and you kind of like are the shepherd
[02:44] of this part of the feature
[02:45] because it hits your goal, helps your girl most,
[02:47] but any other team can come in and be like,
[02:50] Jackson, we need to work on some streak stuff
[02:51] to help with learning, you know, like go for it.
[02:53] Does that just a tangent there?
[02:56] Do they like work really closely with your team
[02:58] if they want to do some work in the code?
[02:59] Is it like, how does that work?
[03:01] Yeah, if you're, again,
[03:03] this is where I say there's soft ownership.
[03:05] We're not against teams doing things to the streak,
[03:07] but if we're going to do something given,
[03:09] we probably have multiple quarters worth
[03:11] of a roadmap around the street.
[03:13] I say probably we do multiple quarters of roadmap
[03:16] for what we can do to the streak.
[03:18] If other teams want to come and mess with it,
[03:20] okay, we got to just figure out
[03:21] how is that going to work with, you know,
[03:24] what our plans for the streak were,
[03:26] how do we make sure a lot of times when teams
[03:27] are coming in thinking, hey, let's do this to the streak.
[03:29] They're like in context that we might have.
[03:31] And so there's as much of like a much simpler version
[03:33] of what we're doing now, a bit of a knowledge sharing
[03:34] of saying, all right, well, this is what we think
[03:36] about the streak.
[03:37] This is what we've seen work, hasn't worked.
[03:38] How does that influence some of the hypothesis
[03:40] that you have?
[03:41] And so I think getting that really,
[03:43] making sure the juice is worth the squeeze.
[03:45] Good old fast and product management work right there.
[03:48] Cool, what else is interesting about how y'all operate
[03:51] and how y'all work to achieve this sort of success?
[03:54] Again, my team lead runs is,
[03:56] Antonia runs like the most, you know, a really process.
[04:00] If you're going to run this mini experience,
[04:01] you have to be really process oriented
[04:03] and really thoughtful about which experiments
[04:05] am I going to run when?
[04:06] How is that going to set up the next one?
[04:08] We, you know, there's heavy Jira automation.
[04:12] I think sometimes the Atlassian suite makes my eyes bleed
[04:15] but like there's a lot of times
[04:16] where that degree of process helps the team
[04:20] unblock engineers and make them move really fast.
[04:22] And so making sure that you have really good process
[04:25] around how are you going to run so many experiments?
[04:28] It's, you know, it's worth investing in.
[04:30] Can you follow that thread actually?
[04:31] Just what do you, when you say that,
[04:32] what does that look like?
[04:33] What are some elements of that process
[04:35] to make this work efficiently?
[04:38] All the way down to really detailed roadmaps around,
[04:41] all right, we're running,
[04:42] this experiment is based on the results
[04:44] of this experiment or my, you know,
[04:47] hook into an element of this feature.
[04:49] How do we make sure that we're lining up
[04:51] implementation on this so that as soon as this thing runs
[04:54] and we're ready to go,
[04:55] we can start rolling out the next one.
[04:57] You know, I hate features just sitting around
[04:59] and us not again continuing that thread.
[05:01] So it's not just thinking about
[05:03] what's our engineering bandwidth
[05:04] but also what's the design bandwidth
[05:06] to make sure that we have
[05:07] the next iteration of this feature ready to go.
[05:09] You know, we're planning months out
[05:12] as we think about these feature iterations,
[05:14] even small ones, you know, feature iterations
[05:17] because again, you just, you lose,
[05:20] when you lose cycles, you know,
[05:21] not pushing on a feature,
[05:23] it's just sort of lost opportunity.
[05:24] And so everything from, you know,
[05:26] being thoughtful about engineering roadmaps
[05:28] to design roadmaps to product roadmaps,
[05:30] all of that needs to come together in a system.
[05:32] So essentially mapping dependencies across function
[05:35] and you're saying in JIRA, you can do this.
[05:38] You can do a lot of it in JIRA.
[05:40] There is a non-zero amount of Google docs that we have
[05:44] that sometimes does things a little bit.
[05:47] I don't know.
[05:47] Sometimes it just looks a little bit nicer.
[05:48] It's a lot more flexible.
[05:50] But JIRA is our, it is where the mother load of process is.
[05:55] Great. Okay. What else?
[05:56] Like another thing that I'll just say is like,
[05:59] we really resist the urge to do the big V1.
[06:03] And I think this is, you know,
[06:04] I shared the street goal example
[06:07] where a lot of times when we're exploring something,
[06:10] we will say, okay, well, like that's cool.
[06:14] How do we strip away a bunch of stuff
[06:16] and figure out what our core hypothesis is?
[06:18] And then just ship that thing first as a V1.
[06:22] Because it's easy and I've found this time and time again,
[06:24] it's easy to add things to features that make them win.
[06:27] Like I've worked in retention engagement long enough.
[06:30] I can like add, I know enough like things to pull
[06:33] and bells to add and whistles
[06:34] and you know, to make something win.
[06:36] But you know, there's a lot of times where it's like,
[06:39] cool, then at one, cause all the whistles you added
[06:41] not cause of what your core hypothesis was.
[06:43] And a lot of times if you can just really simplify
[06:46] what the feature is, it's also much easier to ship.
[06:49] It's easier to design.
[06:49] You're not designing for a whole system.
[06:51] You're designing for, you know, something,
[06:53] something much simpler.
[06:54] And so getting everybody to think that way
[06:57] ends up, you know, allows us to end up shipping faster,
[07:01] shipping simpler, you know, designing faster,
[07:03] getting faster approval, getting insight
[07:06] and then doing what I talked about with street goal,
[07:09] being able to run iteration after iteration
[07:11] after iteration, add these things iteratively.
[07:14] And then, you know, you not only by doing this
[07:17] are you able to move faster,
[07:18] but you get confidence at each step of the way that,
[07:22] hey, my series of hypotheses, you know, is actually born out
[07:25] or if it's not cool, then we're gonna drop
[07:27] that part of the feature
[07:28] and then just ship what actually matters.
[07:30] If I can try to summarize kind of the broad lesson
[07:35] so far that I'm hearing
[07:36] and maybe you would have shared this
[07:38] but I'm just thinking like,
[07:39] if I were to try to design a company
[07:41] to operate the way you all operate,
[07:43] you essentially map all the levers that drive the business.
[07:47] So you have kind of this mapping of all the metrics
[07:49] that drive up to growth and daily active users.
[07:54] You, Kerr ended up being the biggest specific metric
[07:57] to move to drive growth long-term.
[08:02] So there's like imagining a tree
[08:03] of all the opportunities you could work on.
[08:04] You found like, this is what is most connected
[08:08] to our growth long-term.
[08:10] You basically just start mining.
[08:12] I don't know if mining is the right metaphor
[08:14] but just like looking for things
[08:15] that move that specific metric.
[08:17] You just like look and poke and explore.
[08:19] And then once you find one,
[08:20] you just go real deep on trying a lot of different.
[08:22] You come up with a hypothesis
[08:24] and a strategy of here is how we think we can do this
[08:27] and how we can move this
[08:28] and then you just try a bunch of stuff.
[08:31] There's also this element of the rest of development quote,
[08:34] there's always money in the banana stand comes to mind
[08:37] where it's just like keep working on, see there's more.
[08:39] There's going to be more opportunity at this.
[08:42] When I joined Duolingo,
[08:45] the PM that I took over for Anton
[08:47] who used to lead the retention team.
[08:48] I remember saying, dude, the streak,
[08:52] like it just counts up.
[08:54] You guys have been testing on it for years.
[08:55] How much more work can we do on the streak?
[08:57] And he was like, Jackson, you child.
[08:59] He didn't say that exactly this
[09:00] but this is how I felt it like Jackson, you child.
[09:02] There is, we're not even 30% of the way optimized.
[09:05] Four years later, I say that with like such conviction,
[09:09] we are so far away from, I mean,
[09:12] we've made a ton of strides
[09:13] but we are still so far away
[09:15] and every quarter where we ship a ton of wins
[09:18] and improvements to the streak,
[09:20] it just continues to prove to me
[09:22] that like there is so much more to be done.
[09:24] So I think your framing of it is,
[09:28] and I would say there's a lot of thought that goes into,
[09:30] again, I talk about the strength,
[09:32] the hypothesis that you have,
[09:33] you have to have as you start to build out
[09:35] larger future strategy.
[09:36] I do think it's really important
[09:38] to not just do a bunch of random stuff
[09:40] but do it with intent, with a goal in mind.
[09:44] Otherwise you do end up in these local maximas
[09:48] but yeah, I mean, there's still a bunch of stuff
[09:52] that we haven't tried that,
[09:53] I think we have high confidence in working out
[09:55] and so we'll keep doing that.
[09:57] Are there any other say lasting lessons
[10:00] from this journey
[10:01] that if somewhere were to try to operate this way
[10:04] and build streaks into their product,
[10:06] anything you'd recommend?
[10:08] Yeah, I really do think it starts with,
[10:10] you know, streaks are an engagement hack.
[10:12] You know, you can make your app more retentive.
[10:17] I'm almost positive, almost every app out there
[10:19] can make it more retentive.
[10:21] It is loss aversion.
[10:22] That is, you know, again,
[10:23] armchair psychologist Jackson,
[10:25] like it's just a human thing that works on humans
[10:30] but if your app is not something that users want to use every day
[10:36] or whatever, you know, cadence you want your app to be,
[10:39] you know, to work on, it's gonna be,
[10:41] you're only gonna get so much from that streak
[10:43] and honestly it's probably gonna distract you
[10:45] from what really should matter
[10:46] which is making your app something
[10:47] that people want to use every day.
[10:48] And so if you start focusing on the streak
[10:50] but you haven't made that enjoyable experience,
[10:54] you're just gonna waste a lot of time, honestly.
[10:56] And so I think making sure that you have your core loop
[10:58] of your app figured out
[10:59] that it is giving value to users
[11:01] is something that they want to come back to every day.
[11:04] That really sets the stage for something to layer a streak on.
[11:08] So resist the temptation if you haven't, you know,
[11:11] if you don't think you've reached that point
[11:12] to go too hard down the, you know, the path of streak.
[11:16] That's a really good point.
[11:17] Just like a streak is not gonna solve your problems
[11:19] if people don't actually care
[11:20] about the core value you're providing.
[11:22] No, and honestly, it'll probably cause more problems.
[11:24] If what you end up focusing on is
[11:26] how do I make the streak highly engaging
[11:28] but your app isn't, I mean, you're just,
[11:30] you're wasting time that could otherwise be, you know,
[11:34] better spent on solving more critical problems.
[11:36] So that's one learning, you know,
[11:39] the other thing that I'll say is,
[11:41] and we met with one of our board members,
[11:44] Bing Gordon a few weeks or a few months ago, rather,
[11:48] and he had this comment where he was just like,
[11:51] the reason why users care about your streak so much
[11:53] is because you care about your streak so much,
[11:55] you being Duolingo.
[11:57] Like the reason why users care about our streak so much
[11:58] is because Duolingo cares about the streak so much.
[12:00] We're like, what do you mean?
[12:01] He's like, well, after every session,
[12:03] you see a big streak screen
[12:04] and it's animated cooler than almost
[12:06] any other screen in the app.
[12:07] And then sometimes you see some other screens
[12:08] and there's all these other feet,
[12:09] like you don't let a user forget it,
[12:11] you talk about them and messages.
[12:13] And so I think it's worth thinking about,
[12:15] look, if you're gonna build a streak
[12:17] and then you're gonna second it off
[12:19] into the corner of your app, you know,
[12:21] where users aren't gonna see it.
[12:23] Like they're probably not gonna care about it as much
[12:26] which might be fine,
[12:27] because there might be other lovers
[12:28] that you think are more important to pull on.
[12:30] But there's a reason why, you know,
[12:32] we focus as much on the streak as we do
[12:35] and that's because we want it to be top of mind for users.
[12:38] And that's not by accident done
[12:40] that users start to care about.
[12:41] And so I think just as you're thinking
[12:43] about building the streak,
[12:44] making sure that you're giving it the visibility it deserves,
[12:46] if you want it to have the kind of impact
[12:48] that Duolingo has, you know,
[12:51] it's sort of an important hierarchy principle
[12:53] to think about as you design things.
[12:55] That's such a good point.
[12:56] Like you look for cues to the app
[12:58] of tell me what I should pay attention to,
[12:59] what's important if you're just like fire explosions,
[13:02] you made a streak.
[13:03] Oh, maybe I should pay attention to this feature.
[13:06] And then the push notifications
[13:07] obviously encourage you there too.
[13:09] Anything else along those lines?
[13:11] Maybe final thing is,
[13:14] look, we ran so many tests on our Duolingo streak
[13:17] to figure out what worked.
[13:19] I mean, we have a philosophy of Duolingo
[13:21] of tested first, you know,
[13:23] we are a lot of times willing to test things.
[13:25] I really think that if you're gonna try
[13:27] to introduce a streak
[13:28] or you want to improve on the streak you have,
[13:30] like don't get too caught up in the philosophy of everything.
[13:37] I mean, make sure your hypotheses feel like they're good,
[13:39] but my recommendation is just try things.
[13:41] And this is again, you said it earlier,
[13:43] it's like, this is as much human psychology as anything.
[13:46] And as soon as that becomes the case,
[13:48] like you kind of just got to understand
[13:50] what users respond to.
[13:51] And the easiest way to do that is to stop spending time,
[13:55] you know, batting around ideas in a conference room
[13:57] and just try some stuff.
[14:00] So huge recommendation to like,
[14:02] if you're gonna invest in a streak,
[14:04] try and figure out what works through testing with users
[14:07] rather than trying to get it perfect on the first try.
