============================================================

[00:00] like that. There's a quote that you wrote somewhere that to me identifies this point so succinctly.
[00:07] On a long enough timeline, playing positive some games with your customers is the ultimate growth
[00:11] hack. Yeah. Beautiful. It's like, it's, I think that's pretty piffy. And it's also just like,
[00:21] try to argue with it. Positive some games have an incredible returns, especially in the
[00:29] builds of software, right? Where they can experience exponentials very easily. So,
[00:36] yeah, like, there's a lot of, look, I see company building as, I wish there would be
[00:43] better analogy than chess, because chess is a game of perfect information, which is totally
[00:48] incorrect. But one thing which I like about chess as an analogy for business is that it
[00:53] basically is two games that you have to be quoted at both.
[00:55] There's a positional game that you learn, like develop your pieces, get gained influence by your
[01:02] pieces over the board. Like, that's really, really important. And then there's tactics,
[01:10] which you learn tactic training, you go get a puzzle trainer and you drill tactics and you
[01:15] sort of learn the intuition to spot tactics, sense them. Both of them are actually super
[01:22] independent of each other. The business world only talks about tactics. It only talks about
[01:27] the conversion of, like, let's, we did this thing, we changed, we did an AB test and we
[01:32] changed the color of blue and conversion red went up. We lionize the easy hack.
[01:42] I don't think that's important. Like, I honestly, the tactics, I mean,
[01:50] like, you need to make, you need to be good enough at tactics to not go out of business.
[01:53] You can't get margin court, sure. But the sum total of all the value of the potential tactics
[01:59] that you could employ stays with you if you're actually doing the positional game.
[02:06] The positional game is like, what is the territory on the map that you're taking?
[02:13] What role do you play? How much trust do you have with merchants? Do merchants want
[02:17] more from you or less? Like, are you the kind of thing they're trying to optimize out of their
[02:21] software spend or the one that they ask to subsume all other software spend, right?
[02:29] Do they rely on you? Are you part of a team or are you used as a sort of tool in the
[02:34] toolbox, sort of usually forgotten, sometimes coming out when certain tasks are being done?
[02:40] What is, what does your product cover? What industries are you addressing? And so on,
[02:47] this is the positional game. How well do the pieces fit together? Do people like
[02:52] relying even deeper on you? And so if you do that well, the tactics are yours,
[02:59] and you can hire a lot of people who are extraordinarily good at spotting tactics and
[03:03] using them. But if you do it too much, you end up like extracting through the tactics,
[03:10] the entirety of the value that you have created and that is yours to take through the positional
[03:17] game. And if you do that, you have nothing left in the tank. And that's the companies that we all
[03:23] see that just sort of got to a point and then just like fade, right? Like that,
[03:28] those are the companies that got tactic out of their position.
[03:32] And the skill, obviously, is finding the balance between these two things of
[03:36] short-term, not get margin calls as you described, but also think ahead.
[03:39] Is there any kind of heuristic for founders listening to this or like, oh, cool, how do I
[03:44] do this? How much should I be thinking about the future versus now? I guess, how do you try to
[03:47] create this pie chart of drive goals immediately and show investors are killing it while also
[03:51] thinking ahead? Is that good heuristic? I mean, okay, objective number ones don't die, right?
[03:56] Like, so that's again, in the end, for companies that become destroyed companies are the ones
[04:00] which did not die. Like, it's kind of also sounds very basic, but like actually is kind of,
[04:07] it's more actionable than it might seem. Past that point, I would argue just focus on the
[04:13] positional game, right? And I think this is where a bit of a discrepancy of the founder and
[04:20] the rest of the company sometimes lies. I think the founders create finite,
[04:31] winnable games for people that are very much serving the infinite game of developing,
[04:39] that the mission implies, that increase the quality of the position on the board
[04:44] by way it's an infinite board. It's like just picture the chessboard as sort of the
[04:49] initial terrain, but there's like sort of, I don't know, fog on the board and like,
[04:54] it's like a terrain that's much larger that you will explore over time. I think that's sort of
[04:58] the most prettiest way of mentally thinking about the experience of building a company. It's
[05:04] an exploration and a collaborative inquiry into a question that is implied by the mission.
[05:11] And you will get to explore how correct your mission is and how good your decision making is
[05:20] along the way. And you get to learn a lot and this is why I think it's a valuable thing to do.
[05:25] But like they often, the founders and the mission of a company are in alignment,
[05:34] but they are again non quantifiable things. They are pursuits and maybe at time horizons that
[05:42] go past all of our time horizons for our careers, therefore that makes it hard for people to
[05:48] you know, care deeply yet. But they do care about the instances, the games along the way,
[05:53] the sorties that have to be done to explore part of the map, the tactics that have to
[05:58] be executed. I'm not going to take us here, but I know you're a big fan of this book,
[06:02] Fine Art and Infinite Games. I actually had it once at a book club and it blew my mind open.
[06:07] I'm going to link to it. People should check it out. You've talked about this on another podcast.
[06:10] Yeah, it's a lovely book. James Kass did an incredible, like under, he wrote the
[06:15] accident. I think they essentially wrote one of the best business books. There is trying to
[06:20] write a hard philosophy book. So maybe I don't know if it works for its intended purpose,
[06:27] but I think there's more value in what he actually accomplished. Like maybe, sadly,
[06:34] it may be that he didn't know before he died, which just would be very sad.
[06:38] And it's a little hard to read something for people. So just stick with it and just like
[06:41] try to wrap your head around what he's trying to say is my advice. I think reading,
[06:46] I don't know how many it is, but the first couple of chapters really helps you get your
[06:51] arms around the story, like his insight. And the rest of the book are examples of
[07:01] his ideas applied. My takeaway from reading his examples is that he did not fully appreciate the
[07:09] insight of his own idea. I think it just ends up being very locally limited
[07:19] and based on narrow focus. And I think it's a much grander idea than I think he really is.
[07:26] This is why I say I don't think he fully appreciated the quality of his own idea,
[07:29] which I think we need a Toby version of his book with the forward.
[07:33] I heard Simon Simock wrote a book of a similar title. I've actually never gotten around to
[07:37] read it, but I think he would be very good at interpreting this if that's what he did.
[07:41] That's what it sounds like. I feel like his book is that book written in a different way.
