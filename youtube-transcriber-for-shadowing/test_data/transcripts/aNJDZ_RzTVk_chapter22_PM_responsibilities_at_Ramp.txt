============================================================

[00:00] is a few things that come to mind.
[00:02] Team building.
[00:03] So building a culture within the pod
[00:05] because oftentimes your managers are no longer in your team.
[00:12] Engineers might report to different people.
[00:14] Designers might report to different people.
[00:15] PMS might report to different people.
[00:17] So like actually building a team culture within the pod
[00:20] is really, really important.
[00:21] And oftentimes it falls on the PM to create those offsites
[00:24] or to create those ideation sessions
[00:28] to find ways to have fun as a team.
[00:30] The second is making sure that the team is humming
[00:35] in terms of the actual focus areas
[00:39] and then protecting the team from stakeholders
[00:44] that might want to have an opinion
[00:46] or want to have an update
[00:47] or want to schedule certain meetings.
[00:49] So protecting that core team from that chaos
[00:52] and then being the central point of contact
[00:54] if someone has a question or needs something
[00:57] and then being able to bring in the right person
[00:58] at the right time.
[00:59] So those are the different things
[01:01] that is also really important to mention.
[01:04] Going back to a note that I made earlier,
[01:06] you talked about how a lot of this advice
[01:08] you're sharing in the approach to product at Ramp
[01:11] is kind of assuming that the team is A plus.
[01:15] The engineers are A plus.
