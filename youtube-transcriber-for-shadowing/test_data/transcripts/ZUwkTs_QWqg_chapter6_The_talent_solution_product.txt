============================================================

[12:20] Yeah, absolutely.
[12:22] Okay, so let's move to your sweet spot,
[12:25] which is the talent solution product.
[12:27] Is that what it's called?
[12:29] Yeah, so it's basically any product on LinkedIn
[12:31] that helps you get a job or learn a skill.
[12:34] And we have products for recruiters and hires, jobs.
[12:37] So we have products for job seekers,
[12:39] products for, we have LinkedIn learning.
[12:40] And then certainly we run a pretty large creator ecosystem
[12:44] for instructors who post content in LinkedIn learning.
[12:47] And is it true that this is the biggest business
[12:49] within LinkedIn?
[12:50] It is a very big business between LinkedIn
[12:53] and it's certainly hopefully something that,
[12:56] again, if you go back to that vision
[12:57] of connecting people opportunity,
[12:58] it's certainly something that's,
[13:00] I like to think is that very, very core to that,
[13:01] how people get jobs and learn skills.
[13:03] So the feed gets all the glory
[13:05] and you guys are making all the money.
[13:07] I would not say that.
[13:08] But again, we joke about those things
[13:11] and it's so hard at LinkedIn
[13:14] to separate one product from the other.
[13:16] It's really kind of the way we run.
[13:18] It's the way we think about the product.
[13:19] It's really the way we build.
[13:20] Let me just give you like a super concrete example of that.
[13:23] Certainly if you have someone coming in
[13:26] and looking at the feed,
[13:27] one thing we might do is suggest a job recommendation
[13:29] based on what they're looking for in that feed.
[13:32] And so part of what we have to do is think about how
[13:34] someone who's looking at something in their interest
[13:35] might be driving their job-seeking experience as well.
[13:38] And then when they're looking for a job,
[13:40] it's very important that they know
[13:42] how they can actually get connected in that job.
[13:44] So the relationships of the network you build
[13:45] are very much part of that flywheel that go into it.
[13:48] And then even as we start looking at this,
[13:51] you might be looking at a subject
[13:52] and then you wanna go deeper on it
[13:53] and there's a course that comes into it as well, right?
[13:56] And so all of this to me is a very, very connected ecosystem
[14:00] on how those items work together
[14:02] in order to give people opportunity.
[14:03] And so we certainly have,
[14:07] I think a bit from the outside is very different things,
[14:09] but inside, even the way we operate it
[14:11] and the way we think about it,
[14:12] it's a very, very connected ecosystem.
[14:15] What are the components again of this part of the org?
[14:18] We think about it as two different marketplaces.
[14:20] There's a hiring marketplace,
[14:21] which is how do we connect job seekers
[14:23] and recruiters and hiring managers?
[14:25] And then there's a learning marketplace,
[14:26] which is how do you connect learners to instructors?
[14:29] Got it.
[14:30] And then within hiring, are there sub-components?
[14:33] Yeah, so again, we really think about it as a marketplace
[14:35] where we're generally organized around seekers and hires.
[14:38] So there's a team that's kind of working on recruiter,
[14:40] which is probably one of the more kind of flagship products
[14:42] that LinkedIn is always better at.
[14:44] A team working on jobs,
[14:45] which is if you ever post a job on LinkedIn,
[14:48] and then a team working to always help job seekers
[14:50] make sure they connect.
[14:52] And then on the other side, for learners and instructors,
[14:54] a team working on LinkedIn learning,
[14:55] which is one of the bigger enterprise learning products
[14:58] in the world,
[14:58] and then a team working to help instructors.
[15:01] And many people don't know this week,
[15:03] should have two large film studios.
[15:04] So we bring in instructors, we film a lot of content,
[15:08] we have ones in Europe and ones in Santa Barbara,
[15:11] it was all through, started with the Linda acquisition.
[15:14] And so we have a large team of content creators
[15:16] and teams that everyone from makeup artists
[15:19] to script writers that we get to use over there.
[15:22] Wow, it's just marketplaces all the way down
[15:24] as you talk about this.
[15:26] Hiring marketplace, learning marketplace, the feed itself,
[15:29] probably more I'm not thinking about.
[15:31] Yeah, it's very much,
[15:32] I mean, one model that we sometimes use internally as well
[15:35] is how do we operate as marketplaces
[15:38] inside an ecosystem.
[15:40] And I think it kind of speaks to the complexity again
[15:43] of the product and hopefully somehow how we might operate it.
