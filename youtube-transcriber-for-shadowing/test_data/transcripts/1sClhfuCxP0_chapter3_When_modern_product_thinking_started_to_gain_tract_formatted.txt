============================================================

You said that in the Bay Area, things started in the 1970s, something like that. When would you say things started to really ramp up in modern product thinking in India? I think 2010 was kind of when it started because there were a few products that were built before that as well. Somebody mentioned that usually when modern consumer internet starts coming into countries, it typically begins with travel. So, in any country, the first travel company often sets the stage. In India, we saw companies like MakeMyTrip emerging way earlier.

There were also a few very interesting products being built in India that were solving unique needs for Indian consumers, particularly in the matrimony space, such as Shaadi.com and BharatMatrimony.com. But what do you think about Tinder? India is famous for arranged marriages. A product that could truly understand that dynamic—like how a parent might want to help their child find a match—would be quite innovative. This marketplace for matrimony started to take shape, and while there were a few blips here and there, 2010 marked a decade when I can clearly imagine a lot of people began building for India. Flipkart was one of the pioneers that started that journey, followed by others like Ola, which was similar to Uber in what they were doing elsewhere.

In the food delivery space, for instance, when I was working at Swiggy, that started around 2014 or 2015. Now, we see a whole bunch of startups trying to innovate, exploring what an Uber or DoorDash for India could look like. It's a very different landscape, and I think now is the time when we see a lot more product building in that area.

What are some numbers regarding companies in India, the money being spent, or other metrics that might reveal a bigger opportunity than one might initially think? This is a very broad question, so before diving into the opportunities in India, I think it's important to discuss the complexity of the market, which many people might not fully understand. India has about 1.4 billion people, and there have been three significant waves that have occurred, both in India and globally. The first wave was the transition from desktop to mobile, followed by the shift from mobile to smartphones. Then came what we call the "Jio revolution," where an Indian company made internet access incredibly affordable for smartphones.

As a result, a large population came online, eager for new products and content, and seeking different ways to interact with each other and utilize the internet. This was one of the major waves. Another critical aspect is what the Indian government has enabled, particularly in digitizing core citizen-related services. Digital payments have become a game changer, with many Indians now having bank accounts by default, thanks to systems like UPI. Even small transactions, like five rupees—which is about 10 cents—can be made through UPI, leading people to move away from cash.

There's also something called the India Stack, which combines social security, identity, payments, and more, allowing various apps to build layers on top of this infrastructure. Many interesting use cases have emerged from this. 

Now, let's consider India's diversity. The number of languages spoken here is vast, with the saying that every 15 miles, the language and culture change. It's a huge country with a diverse population, so traditional ways of thinking about product development—like identifying your target audience—become more complex. You have to consider whether you're building for one demographic or another. Frameworks that might work elsewhere can break down here.

Additionally, the price point that people are willing to pay is another interesting factor. The per capita income in India is relatively low, around two to two-and-a-half thousand dollars, compared to the U.S., which is about 30 times higher. While there are many people who can drive traffic and engagement, identifying the right paying customers who will actually engage and spend money is a premium challenge. 

This makes it much harder to determine who will pay delivery fees or buy more expensive items in e-commerce. Consequently, a whole new set of strategies and ways of thinking has evolved in this country, contributing to its vibrant and unique product landscape, distinct from any other global market.
