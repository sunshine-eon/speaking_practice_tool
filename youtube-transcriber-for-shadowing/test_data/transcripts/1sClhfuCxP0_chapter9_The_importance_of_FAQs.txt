============================================================

[00:00] That's a really cool idea of just using the PRFAQ
[00:03] and working backwards process to think very differently,
[00:07] partly to make sure you've explored all the options,
[00:08] partly to just like think through things
[00:11] that are kind of in the back of people's minds
[00:12] and see if there's something there
[00:14] before committing to the one direction.
[00:15] So the FAQs also are very important
[00:17] to kind of set processes in the system.
[00:20] For example, if now we are Jupiter,
[00:21] we are a financial services app.
[00:23] So every FAQ will mandatory really have
[00:25] how are we going to make sure
[00:26] that it is fully compliant.
[00:27] Have you gotten sign off from ABC people?
[00:30] Have you actually thought about legal aspects
[00:32] and so on and so forth?
[00:33] So for example, you can use the FAQs very effectively here.
[00:36] For example, when it was Swiggy
[00:38] and it's a three way marketplace,
[00:40] you have consumers, delivery executives
[00:41] and restaurant partners.
[00:43] Now any small change that you do on say delivery partners,
[00:46] for example, if you're working on optimizing their earnings
[00:49] per hour, which will lead to some changes
[00:50] in cost per delivery,
[00:52] but that may have a completely different impact
[00:54] on delivery fee for I'm just making this up.
[00:56] But now because of so many moving parts
[01:00] in your FAQs, you're explicitly asking,
[01:02] have you thought about what are the implications
[01:04] on restaurant partner?
[01:06] Have you thought about what are implications
[01:07] on delivery partners?
[01:09] And we in fact used to have that
[01:10] we are FAQ in terms of,
[01:11] we'll write down the different segments
[01:13] of delivery partners.
[01:14] And sometimes it will have extremely weird correlations
[01:17] because there's a product managers
[01:18] on one side of the equation
[01:20] have started thinking or at least consulting
[01:23] the other part of the marketplace,
[01:26] what could this mean for you?
[01:27] And just it gets everybody together
[01:29] to create very crisp products that work
[01:32] for all sides of the marketplace.
