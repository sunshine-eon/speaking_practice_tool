============================================================

[00:00] I feel like every story is a fractal into hours of other podcast conversation we can
[00:05] have.
[00:06] I don't have to go run this 9,000, 10,000 person company and do real work.
[00:11] So I'm going to end it there.
[00:12] We got through almost everything I was hoping to get through, but there's infinitely more
[00:15] questions I still have.
[00:17] Just to maybe end it, is there anything you want to leave listeners with, any last
[00:20] nugget that maybe you didn't mention?
[00:24] If I get to talk to, again, people who look at product and product management, here's
[00:29] my thing that I think maybe only implicitly came through in all this.
[00:36] Every product in the world, the quality at the end of the day is simply a reflection
[00:40] of how much the people who created it gave a shit about product.
[00:45] And it is not possible to make great products if the people who work on it do not give
[00:51] a shit about the product.
[00:52] And I actually think this is a very important role for product leaders to make sure that
[00:59] the team gives a shit.
[01:01] And I think this is something that can be done with building empathy for people using
[01:05] it, but also it can be done infectiously by the product leader.
[01:11] The product leader has to give a shit.
[01:13] Do not engage in product work on products that you don't care about because you
[01:19] cannot produce the thing that the person who will give you a task is looking for.
[01:25] And I think that this is just kind of, again, it so much goes into this unquantifiable conversation
[01:31] which we already had, but boy is that important because it just isn't about the brief document.
[01:38] It isn't about the aligning stakeholders.
[01:42] It isn't sometimes in some places some of those things are aspects of it.
[01:46] And I think they correlate sometimes with people, but I think the higher order bit is
[01:50] if you are in product, you have basically three roles.
[01:56] You have to have the team sits to look around corners that they don't see.
[02:01] You just have to understand this thing that's being done better than everyone else
[02:06] because that's a role.
[02:10] Now, you don't have to do this by yourself.
[02:11] Everyone on the team is of a resource to you.
[02:16] And you can query them and therefore determine what is around the corners and so on,
[02:22] but in engineering and UX and so on.
[02:24] But that's really important.
[02:27] And the second is you've got to be exothermically infectious with actually caring about this thing
[02:35] because just that one thing alone will make a 10 times better product.
[02:39] It's crazy how much of a change this makes.
[02:46] I feel like, honestly, what you're describing here is founder mode,
[02:49] what the outputs are, giving a shit, being exothermic, excited,
[02:54] and looking around corners.
[02:56] I feel like this is its own conversation here.
[02:58] Yeah, I agree.
[02:58] I don't think founder mode.
[02:59] So I think founder mode is a super valuable term,
[03:05] but I answer the question about what I think about founder mode
[03:12] in the discussion about pumping heat into systems.
[03:16] Like, that's what I do.
[03:19] It's just that founder mode, founder-run company,
[03:22] I think this has an easier time existing
[03:24] because people dislike the people who are pumping heat into a thing.
[03:29] People fight them, people put them out.
[03:31] And if the boss is like this, boss can protect other people like this.
[03:36] And therefore, I think founder-run companies can be innovative longer
[03:39] because there's a substrate by which this can stay a thing for a long time.
[03:45] So anyway, that's my theory on the founder mode discussion,
[03:49] which I think is a really fascinating discussion.
[03:52] I think it's very valuable.
[03:55] I'm sure it's misunderstood in all sorts of ways,
[03:57] but I think it's more actionable than people think.
[04:01] Toby, I appreciate you continuing to drop nuggets,
[04:03] even though I know you have to go.
[04:05] By the way, your video looks incredible right now.
[04:07] You look like you're in like this is amazing editing we're doing.
[04:10] Like a rainbow streaming across your body.
[04:14] Yeah, we really hit the rainbows here.
[04:15] Like, well, here's the gold event.
[04:17] I hope you got the gold that you were hoping.
[04:20] And I was so much gold.
[04:21] Sufficient leprechaun here to deliver.
[04:26] What a metaphor.
[04:27] Okay, Toby, thank you so much for doing this.
[04:28] This was incredible.
[04:30] I feel like this is going to help so many people build great companies
[04:33] and thank you for the first principle.
[04:34] Okay, I got to run. Bye-bye.
[04:36] Okay, bye.
