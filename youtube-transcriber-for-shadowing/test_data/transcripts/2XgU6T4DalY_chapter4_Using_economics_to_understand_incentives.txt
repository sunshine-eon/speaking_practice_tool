============================================================

[00:00] Just to pull on a thread a little bit more, is there something very tactical or concrete
[00:05] that you can share that you find helpful with that background that you found helpful in
[00:08] your career?
[00:09] Other than the dismal, dry science of it all.
[00:15] So one example would probably be in understanding incentives and thinking about unintended consequences.
[00:27] And I think that that is true both in terms of internal leadership.
[00:32] So being part of a management team that's thinking about how do we clarify priorities
[00:38] or motivate a company or define the problems we want to solve.
[00:43] And then part of it is more externally oriented.
[00:46] How do we want to think about what Netflix is to consumers and how we want to think about
[00:51] competition?
[00:52] And there can be a rational way of thought, which is one version of economics of like
[00:57] shouldn't rational intelligent people behave in the following way?
[01:02] And then there's the well, if given certain incentives, what might you see that we didn't
[01:07] think was optimal or we weren't expecting to happen, but could be a consequence or repercussion
[01:11] here.
[01:12] And so I think that that type of framing, I don't know if it's unique to economics
[01:18] in a way, you know, because it has elements of psychology to it as well and kind of planning
[01:23] ahead has become really useful for thinking through kind of cause and effect.
[01:30] So that has come up in a lot of different spaces in Netflix and in other roles I've
[01:34] been in.
