============================================================

Let me go in a slightly different direction. We talked about how you have no direct reports. You've never had any direct reports. I know that's somewhat related to a piece of advice you often share, which is to lean into your strengths and to not do things that you're not amazing at yet. So can you just talk about why this is the case? Why don't you have any reports, and then this idea of just strengths and the importance of focusing on strengths?

I'll tell you the quick story as to how this came about. My co-founder and I had the kind of founding meeting for HubSpot. This is the week where we've decided we're going to do this, and then we have this list of questions or topics for the kind of founder's discussion. One of them, and I think I've published a list, is about the questions all co-founders should ask each other in that early period. One of the questions is, okay, well, who's going to be CEO? 

This was an easy one for us because I had been CEO twice before and had figured out that I'm not that good at it and actually suck at that role. One of the reasons I struggle with being a CEO is that part of the role involves being good at managing people. It's not just about leading and having a vision; you actually have to manage as a craft. I think Brian, my co-founder, already had that in his head, and that made for a very quick conversation. 

As soon as I had that wind behind me, I thought, okay, well, I don't want to be CEO. Since Brian had never done it before, it was an easy decision. Then I said, oh, and by the way, I don't want to have any direct reports. That just popped into my head as an idea. I hadn't pre-planned it or anything; I just sprung it on him. The reason is that I've learned I suck at management. 

I'm a reasonably smart person, and I think I could become passively okay at management with some training or coaching. However, I don't want to spend any years of my life becoming passively okay at something. I would rather take those same calories and focus on the things that I'm good at and actually enjoy. Those things are highly correlated; you tend to be good at the things you enjoy and enjoy the things you're good at. 

Brian was like, yeah, sure, but then I clarified, no, no, Brian, you don't understand. There will be times in the company when, for example, our VP of engineering just quits, and there will be pressure to have this team report to you until we find someone else. I emphasized that we need to promise each other that we won't do that. We had that heart-to-heart conversation, and it was one of the best decisions I've made both for myself and for HubSpot. 

Had I not made that decision, I’m a startup guy, and I don't know that I would have survived at a company the size of HubSpot. Right now, I can honestly say I'm having a better time at HubSpot now, with 7,000 people, than I was having at 70 people. The reason is that I get all the upside of scale; I can make big bets, we can have long-term plans, and we can plan for global domination without the downsides of scale, which often involve managing a lot of people and all the complexities that come with that. 

I appreciate others who manage that, but I don't. So I get all the upside with very little of the downside of scale, and that's what keeps me engaged, energized, and happy at HubSpot. I think it's been both productive for HubSpot and good for me.
