We have this term you hold instead of a startup; it's a stay up. Yes, I'm so sick of the startups. I mean, like it's cool to start a business, obviously, but I'm sick of that term dominating. Because frankly, starting a business is actually way easier than staying in business. Now, none of it's easy, so I want to be supportive of people who are starting businesses, but they should know that that's actually not the hard part.

I mean, literally tomorrow I can start a new business. You can come up with a name, make a thing, put it in the app store, and sell it for two bucks, and like you got a business going, right? But are you going to be there in two years? Are you going to be there in five years when competition rushes in? When you have employees, are you going to be there? Staying is harder than starting. And so I'm here to celebrate stay ups. Plenty of other people are here to celebrate startups.

I feel the same way with newsletters, and it's also true for podcasts. It's easy to start a newsletter, hard to keep it going. Totally. Yeah. I mean, I've seen your newsletter kind of fly, right? We have a newsletter, and like it's been pretty flat. I'm like, how does he do it? It's hard. It's really hard. It's hard to build a podcast audience. It's hard to build a newsletter audience.

So yeah, starting something is really easy, but then you're going to end up in this plateau area because most people get some initial growth, the word gets out, whatever. They end up with like 6,000 somethings, and then you're kind of stuck there. And then it's like, well, do you want to keep doing this? Were you just high on the growth, or do you actually like the thing? If you want to do the thing for a long period of time, you've got to like the thing because you're going to have to endure these moments of plateaus, which is kind of what staying up is all about.

And sometimes those go down. I mean, like we've had wavy years, right? Always been profitable, but our profits differ every year. Sometimes it's more, and sometimes it's less, and sometimes our margin is more, and sometimes it's less. You know, if you compare yourself to the previous year, you can kind of get demoralized to some degree. But I just kind of like to ask, what do we want to keep doing? And then we're in it to stay in it.
