============================================================

[30:36] and kind of what is seen as success here.
[30:39] And just to clarify, so that North Star is that phrase
[30:41] that used of just connecting people
[30:43] to economic opportunity, right?
[30:44] That's it, that's it.
[30:45] And it sounds, I know it sounds bigger than it seems,
[30:48] but I can probably, you know, time example again,
[30:51] you can understand when someone's driving on it
[30:53] and I haven't been here for a little bit now,
[30:55] you can understand when someone knows that,
[30:56] when someone's doesn't, it's a hard thing to lose track of.
[31:00] Yeah, it does sound vague in like a nice fuzzy warm thing
[31:03] that people can say.
[31:05] What you're saying is that it's actually like,
[31:07] it's brought up in meetings constantly in product reviews,
[31:11] like you're saying in this product review,
[31:12] everything changed when you came at it
[31:15] from that one perspective.
[31:16] Yeah, I mean, this was my first product here
[31:19] was the profile.
[31:21] You can make a profile that does a lot of different things
[31:23] as you can imagine.
[31:24] You could, you know, you could think about
[31:27] how identity could be used in many different phase
[31:29] and what you should prioritize or not.
[31:31] But if you can explain why this is the thing
[31:34] that you should do that would help someone, you know,
[31:36] really do what they want to do,
[31:38] maybe it's, you know, have an incredible podcast
[31:41] and send that out there.
[31:42] Maybe it's helping them connect to a job,
[31:44] but if you can understand intent and how this unlocked
[31:46] and why you want to prioritize that item,
[31:49] all of a sudden the world gets a lot simpler.
[31:51] How does that actually get operationalized at a company?
[31:53] Is it just the leaders remind people of that?
[31:56] It's like painted on the walls.
[31:58] How is that a thing that people come back to over and over?
[32:01] I do think it's a lot of repeat, repeat, repeat.
[32:03] I do think that's it.
[32:04] I do think the culture has a pretty high immune system now
[32:07] in the sense that when you aren't operating by that,
[32:09] people can see it and they operate against it.
[32:12] But I also think it's probably the,
[32:15] I think when, you know, Jeff was the, and Ryan
[32:19] and they are just exceptional at continuously repeating that.
[32:23] And it's been so consistent for so long
[32:25] that I think it's just kind of the DNA now.
[32:28] And I do think it's exceptional.
[32:29] I think it's exceptional leadership
[32:31] and I've learned so much from kind of watching it
[32:32] and how it gets operated.
[32:34] Is there a metric associated with that
[32:36] when people use it in a way of like,
[32:39] no, that's not actually what we mean.
[32:40] Is there some way of making it even more concrete
[32:42] in goals, metrics, ways to understand
[32:44] if people are actually achieving that?
[32:46] Yeah, totally.
[32:47] So I think at the next level of operation,
[32:49] what we think about is, you know,
[32:51] when we run these marketplaces
[32:52] throughout this ecosystem to connect people out to me,
[32:55] what are the outputs that they matter?
[32:56] So I'll just give you mine.
[32:58] For example, we think a lot about number of hires,
[33:00] how many people did we match,
[33:02] which is a real tangible way of looking at opportunity.
[33:04] And then number of people who learned a skill,
[33:06] which is usually in this world measured more by time
[33:08] than anything.
[33:09] If you learn, spend time for X amount of minutes,
[33:11] we kind of do that skill
[33:12] because oftentimes skills don't have a direct outcome
[33:14] as you can measure it.
[33:16] And so we basically look at those things more than any other
[33:18] to say how successful that we are operating that marketplace.
[33:22] Got it.
[33:23] That was make total sense to me.
