============================================================

[00:00] Okay, so we had some questions come in from the audience when we were preparing for this.
[00:04] We both tweeted to see what people wanted to ask.
[00:06] I have two that I picked out.
[00:08] One is from Matt Mullenweg.
[00:10] How cool is that?
[00:11] Oh my God.
[00:12] And I think you may have seen this question, but the question is, what is the spectacular
[00:15] failure of someone trying to follow your advice and failing when it doesn't stick?
[00:20] What is the reason?
[00:22] People trying to make rapid, fundamentally like 180 degree changes quickly is a grave
[00:28] way to fall flat on your face, basically.
[00:31] So I have seen people who try to adopt, let's say, shape up and they come back six weeks
[00:38] later and like, this sucks.
[00:39] This doesn't work.
[00:40] I'm like, I'm not surprised to hear that.
[00:42] Like tell me, tell me how you did it.
[00:44] And then they explain like, oh, the next project we did, we did this.
[00:46] I'm like, yeah, I'm really not surprised to hear that now because you just,
[00:52] you can't really do that.
[00:54] You can't turn on a dime.
[00:56] There's this thing called momentum.
[00:57] I always try to think of things in terms of like the physical world, like the more
[01:01] massive an object, the more energy it takes to change its direction.
[01:05] This is why big companies move slowly.
[01:07] This is also why momentum, which is like the way you've been working for four years
[01:11] is going to power you forward in a certain way.
[01:13] It's very hard to turn the corner immediately or turn around.
[01:16] You just cannot do it physically.
[01:17] If you can't do it physically, you can't do it this way.
[01:20] So I think that's what I've seen is like these, these rap, like, all right,
[01:24] starting tomorrow or starting shape up.
[01:25] It's like, well, no.
[01:26] You're not, it's not going to work unless you say we're going to do it on this
[01:29] other thing that doesn't matter so much.
[01:30] So that's one thing I would say.
[01:32] The other thing is that pretty much every business is a spectacular failure.
[01:37] It's just, it just, it's like business is really hard.
[01:40] And the ones that make it are all outliers.
[01:42] And, you know, this is why most businesses fail.
[01:45] And, you know, it's, it's, there's a million reasons why.
[01:49] And it's always hard to pin it down.
[01:51] But so it's, so, and we can all look back.
[01:54] This is why, by the way, I don't,
[01:56] I don't like to look back on, on things.
[01:58] I'm not much of a fan of looking back on failures and trying to figure out
[02:02] what went wrong so we don't do it again, because I don't think we know what went wrong.
[02:07] I think we can spend a long time trying to analyze it and we're going to find
[02:10] something that we can agree on.
[02:12] And it tends to be what you can agree on so you can move on.
[02:15] But that doesn't mean that's what it was.
[02:17] So just like we don't really know why you make decisions.
[02:20] You don't really know why things didn't work.
[02:22] I mean, sometimes there's some examples.
[02:24] And I think it's true if you're talking about a mechanistic system,
[02:28] your stamping metal, and they're supposed to have perfect circles and it's an oval.
[02:31] You can go back to that machine and see how the thing worked and the line.
[02:34] You can adjust that and fix that.
[02:36] A lot of work, though, is not that way, especially software work.
[02:39] There's a million different inputs and a million different people.
[02:41] And it's not simple stamping machines.
[02:43] It's a different thing.
[02:45] So I don't know, but I do think that trying to make big changes too
[02:50] quickly is a primary reason.
[02:54] And you've seen this approach work at traditional companies.
[02:57] I imagine it's not just companies that work in your way where there's no investors.
[03:01] They're not obsessed with growth.
[03:03] You've seen shape up implemented at traditional public type companies.
[03:07] Yeah, it's usually smaller teams.
[03:09] So it's not like Airbnb.
[03:11] Brian's not going to go, OK, tomorrow we're following this thing
[03:13] that these guys over 37 signals came up with.
[03:16] But it's typically small teams inside larger companies that experiment
[03:19] with this and sometimes it spreads and sometimes it doesn't.
[03:22] And it doesn't always need to.
[03:23] It could be this one division, this one group that works a different way.
[03:26] And also, it doesn't have to be fully shape up.
[03:28] It could be 30% of it.
[03:30] Maybe it's just simply the six week cycle thing is the thing that really sort
[03:33] of is the thing and the rest of it doesn't matter so much.
[03:38] Or it could be this idea of of appetites versus estimates, and they can
[03:42] work that into the way they work.
[03:43] You know, take take whatever works is you don't have to go wholesale.
