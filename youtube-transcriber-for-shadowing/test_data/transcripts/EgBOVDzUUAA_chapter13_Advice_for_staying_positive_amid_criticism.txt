============================================================

[00:00] like an hyper local service.
[00:01] How do you stay positive and focused
[00:05] and not let that stuff bring you down?
[00:07] And do you have advice for founders in India
[00:09] that are dealing with the same sort of feedback?
[00:11] It's fine, the number of calls I've got from founders
[00:13] who start getting hit and go to person to get this call
[00:17] because they've seen me get it for many more years.
[00:21] And I tell people that we couldn't have made it this far
[00:25] if we cared about criticism of everybody
[00:29] versus people who've done better than us.
[00:33] If somebody who's done anything better than me
[00:37] gives me any amount of criticism,
[00:40] I will absolutely flip and make all the changes and evolve.
[00:44] And I seek feedback all the time from people.
[00:47] But if I have started taking feedback from everybody
[00:50] who do not understand and empathize with what I'm doing,
[00:52] I'm not saying that we should not take customers' feedback.
[00:54] That's very different.
[00:55] But let's say somebody commenting about your business
[00:58] who does not understand the nuance of it,
[01:01] you can't be reacting to everything.
[01:03] And I often tell people that there's
[01:06] a reason elements with lower valencies
[01:09] are called noble gases because they're
[01:11] hardest to get reaction from.
[01:14] Over my head, but I love it.
