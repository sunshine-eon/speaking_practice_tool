============================================================

[00:00] Dimitri, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.
[00:04] Hi, Lenny, and happy to be here.
[00:07] As you know, I've been doing a bunch of research into which companies hire and create the best
[00:12] product managers.
[00:13] And I've been triangulating this across a bunch of different data points.
[00:15] I've been looking at which companies, alumni product managers, get promoted most when they
[00:20] leave the company, become chief product officers at the highest rate when they leave the company,
[00:25] become the first PM at a startup, also start their own companies.
[00:29] And when I triangulate it across all these different data points, there's three companies
[00:34] that are kind of sad at the top.
[00:36] You guys, Revolut, Palantir and Intercom, clearly you guys are doing something really
[00:41] special.
[00:42] I don't think a lot of people, especially in the US, know a ton about Revolut.
[00:46] And so I'm really excited to have you here.
[00:48] I'm really excited to basically extract as much wisdom as I can from you about what you
[00:52] guys have figured out in helping in hiring and training product managers.
[00:56] So I want to actually start with giving people a slight understanding of what is Revolut.
[01:02] I think a lot of people in the US especially don't know much about it.
[01:05] So what's the simplest way to understand what you guys do?
[01:08] Revolut challenges banks in 50 different countries.
[01:13] And the toll started 10 years ago in London.
[01:16] So maybe let me give you a bit of a context, especially for someone based in the US.
[01:21] It's important to understand that European banking landscape is very diverse.
[01:27] In the US, if you travel from state to state, things are different.
[01:31] But for example, you always pay in US dollars, right?
[01:35] In the UK, you pay in British pound.
[01:37] If you travel to mainland Europe, you will pay in Euro.
[01:40] But if you go to Switzerland, you'll pay in Swiss francs.
[01:44] If you go to Sweden, you'll pay in Swedish Krona and so on.
[01:47] So overall, there are 25 different currencies.
[01:50] And every time you were traveling and paying in a different currency, banks were charging
[01:56] you exorbitant fees on top of terrible foreign exchange rates.
[02:01] And that's when Revolut launched as a multi-currency card.
[02:08] And people loved it.
[02:10] They loved that Revolut was saving them 50 or 100 euros.
[02:15] But even more so, they loved the transparency and simplicity of the product.
[02:23] And that's why when we started rolling out more and more products based on those principles,
[02:30] they were quickly getting trust of people.
[02:32] They were quickly getting traction.
[02:33] So that's how P2P transfers appeared and then frictionless crypto buying and withdrawal
[02:41] to a bank account appeared.
[02:42] And then more and more products, created products, savings products and so on.
[02:46] Awesome.
[02:47] And then just to give people a few kind of scale, the company, how many employees are
[02:50] there roughly, I think the last valuation, something around 60 billion.
[02:53] I don't know if you can even comment on that.
[02:55] But just what are some numbers real quick for people to understand the scale of the company
[02:58] at this point?
[02:59] The headcount is not something we're trying to increase, to be honest.
[03:03] Actually, Revolut tries to stay as lean as possible.
[03:06] But I think it's just that our appetite for growth is so big that I think we're currently
[03:13] at maybe 6,000 or 7,000 employees.
