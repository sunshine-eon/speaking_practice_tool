============================================================

Way too many founders apologize for how they want to run the company. They find some midpoint between how they want to run a company and how the people they lead want to run the company. That's a good way to make everyone miserable because what everyone really wants is clarity. What everyone really wants is to be able to row in the same direction really quickly. 

And so I basically got involved in every single detail. I told leaders that leaders are in the details. There's this negative term called micromanagement. I think there's a difference between micromanagement, which is like telling people exactly what to do, and being in the details. Being in the details is what every responsible company's board does to the CEO. It doesn't mean the board is telling them what to do. But if you don't know the details, how do you know people are doing a good job? 

People think that a great leader's job is to hire people and just empower them to do a good job. Well, how do you know they're doing a good job if you're not in the details? I made sure I was in the details, and we really drove the product. 

Today, my guest is Brian Chesky. Brian is the CEO and co-founder of Airbnb, which he started in his apartment with his co-founders, Joe and Nate, and has turned into an $80 billion global business with travelers and homes in 220 countries. I was very lucky to get to work with Brian for many years. My sense is if you ask people who they consider the most inspiring tech or business leaders today, Brian would be right near the top of that list. 

In our conversation, Brian shares an in-depth explanation of what's happening with product management at Airbnb, which caused quite a stir in the product world when he talked about this previously. We also get deep into Brian's new approach of how he runs Airbnb, including shifting away from traditional growth channels like paid growth, and instead betting that if they just build the best possible product and tell people about it, growth will happen. 

We discuss how the product team now operates, including having just one single roadmap across the entire company, and Brian staying very close to every design and every feature. We also get a bit into his personal life, including how he finds balance and avoids burnout, and how he continues to learn himself so that he can stay ahead of the business and its growth. 

This is a very special episode for me, and I'm thrilled to bring you Brian Chesky after a short word from our sponsors. 

This episode is brought to you by Sidebar. Are you looking to land your next big career move or start your own thing? One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career—and something that worked really well for me a few years ago—is to create a personal board of directors, a trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just kind of gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. 

This has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group. With Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted, private, supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Everyone has their own zone of genius, so together we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls, leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact. 

Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused tactical feedback at every step of your journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're likely already driven and committed to growth. A Sidebar personal board of directors is the missing piece to catalyze that journey.

You fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined.

Brian, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast. 

Well, thank you for having me. Did you ever think when I left Airbnb, one, that I would have a podcast and two, that you'd be on my podcast? 

I had no idea you would become a podcast host and that you would have such accessible podcasts. But yeah, congrats on everything. It was awesome.
