============================================================

[00:00] I want to touch on linear, one, it's interesting that you guys have a lot of similar philosophies
[00:07] and what is it about project management, task management software that creates this sort
[00:13] of approach to business?
[00:14] So that's maybe one question if there's something there.
[00:16] And then the other is, it feels like they have a lot of similar philosophies.
[00:21] Growth isn't a focus, it's got an instinct.
[00:23] They have paid work trials, they're very profitable, they don't spend a lot of
[00:28] time around VC money.
[00:29] Do you have a feeling like this approach could work in the venture route?
[00:33] And do you see them as maybe an example of like, hey, maybe you could adopt a lot of these
[00:36] things and also raise money and maybe there's another direction here?
[00:39] Yeah, I mean, I don't know enough about them to comment on.
[00:43] I've heard some about them and it sounds like they have some similar points of view.
[00:48] Where those came from, I don't know, maybe they materialized, I don't know
[00:51] where, maybe they picked them up from someone else, maybe they came up with them themselves.
[00:56] That's a different ways to work.
[00:58] It's nice to hear that other people are trying some of these things and it's working for them.
[01:01] So that's great.
[01:03] The thing with the VC route, so like the idea of like having too much money, it doesn't
[01:08] mean you can't work efficiently and thoughtfully.
[01:11] But it does create a degree of sloppiness because you don't have to.
[01:18] When you don't have to, and when I'm saying have to, you could say have to what?
[01:22] Have to do a whole bunch of things.
[01:24] When you don't have to, when you don't have to make money, when you don't have to be efficient,
[01:28] when you don't have to be profitable, you just kind of get sloppy.
[01:33] And so let's hire some more people or whatever we can afford to.
[01:38] In fact, they need to suspend the money by the way.
[01:39] They didn't give us the money to save it and earn 6% interest, which would be great
[01:44] now.
[01:45] Three years ago, 0% interest.
[01:46] Like they didn't give us the money to sit in the bank, they gave somebody to spend
[01:48] the money.
[01:49] We're going to spend it on two things, people and marketing.
[01:54] So we can buy more ads, we can do more of this, more do that, we can hire more people,
[01:57] build up more teams, do more things simultaneously, and there's a certain sloppiness in that.
[02:02] So I think it just becomes harder when the environment encourages slop, which is why I
[02:08] think the value in bootstrapping is that it teaches entrepreneurs, it not even teaches,
[02:14] it forces them to have to figure out how to make money.
[02:18] And the more time under the curve they have making money and practicing making money
[02:23] the better at it they're going to get.
[02:25] Like I use the guitar metaphor, but earlier I'll use it again.
[02:27] If you're playing guitar, if I give you guitar and ask you to go up on stage and play
[02:31] guitar, you're going to suck and it's going to be horribly embarrassing and you're going
[02:34] to be terrible at it.
[02:36] You might be terrible at it a month later, but you'll be slightly better at it.
[02:38] You do it for six months or a year, you're going to be better and better and then
[02:41] five years are going to be really damn good, right?
[02:44] Why do we think that a business that is sloppy that doesn't have to make their
[02:47] own money that is just getting pumped full of money by somebody else can all
[02:50] of a sudden turn on the profit spigot and all of a sudden be profitable.
[02:54] And what you see is that they often times cannot because they're just not set up
[02:59] to be that way.
[03:00] They've never played guitar before and now they're being asked to play guitar.
[03:04] So the reason I think it's great for entrepreneurs to start bootstrapping is
[03:07] because they just have more practice making money and they get better and
[03:09] better and better at the fundamental skill you need to have ultimately
[03:13] turn a successful business, which is to make money.
[03:16] And if you don't have to do that from the start, you're just not practicing
[03:18] that you're practicing spending money and getting good at spending money is not
[03:22] as valuable skills getting good at making money.
[03:25] That's why I think it's just harder, but of course it's possible.
[03:28] It's just harder.
