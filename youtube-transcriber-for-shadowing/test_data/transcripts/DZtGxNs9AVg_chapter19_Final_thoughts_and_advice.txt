============================================================

[00:00] it. Anton, is there anything else that you wanted to share anything you want to leave
[00:04] listeners with before I let you go and go to sleep?
[00:08] I think, again, the world is changing quickly, and it's very fun. You should see it as like
[00:14] have fun in all of this change. And the best thing you can do for your current profession
[00:22] or if you want to have a new job is to be in the top 1% in knowing how to use
[00:26] AI tools. So go out there, use lovable, use other AI tools, and make sure to
[00:34] understand or try to understand as much as possible in how to use them
[00:38] productively. That's something I tell all my friends generally, and I love
[00:44] the audience to know as well.
[00:46] Okay, well I gotta try to make this even more specific for people. How do you know
[00:50] if you're in the top 1% like what's like a heuristic almost of like slash
[00:54] how do you get there? Is it just use it a hundred times a day? What else can you
[00:58] recommend?
[00:59] Yeah, I think if you spend a full week on trying to reach an outcome, the best way
[01:06] to learn is like I want to do this thing and then I want to use AI to do that
[01:09] thing. And you spend a full week, you're in the top 1% in the global
[01:14] population. If you have friends that you surround yourself with friends who
[01:19] have this obsession or they also care a lot about this, then you'd be
[01:23] quickly in the top 0.1%.
[01:27] So what I'm hearing is like find a problem that can be solved, like find a
[01:31] problem, a pain point for yourself or someone, and then end to end like
[01:35] fully solve that problem, spend a week getting from idea to like a thing
[01:39] that was actually somebody's actually using.
[01:41] Yeah.
[01:42] And you're in the top 1%.
[01:44] Yeah, I think at the top 1% were just spending a full week and
[01:50] making sure that you're asking AI if you don't understand.
[01:53] So making sure that you can understand.
[01:55] Yeah, like that's the thing people forget, you just ask like would you ask
[02:00] the chat feature of lovable in this case or would you go to cloud or chat
[02:02] GPT to ask for advice?
[02:04] I mean, my recommendation here, if you're a product is to use lovable
[02:09] to build software and learn that AI tool, and then you should use
[02:14] chat mode. And chat mode, I have to add, is something you activate in
[02:18] your user profile.
[02:19] It's not launched like in the main product.
[02:23] So it's in labs.
[02:25] But if you add that flag, then you can use chat mode.
[02:29] If you want to learn some other AI tool, then you should, I mean,
[02:35] ask that tool or ask cloud or chat GPT about how that domain works.
[02:42] Okay, amazing.
[02:44] Where can people find you, where can they find lovable
[02:47] and how can listeners be useful to you?
[02:49] Lovable posts, updates and means on lovable underscore dev on Twitter.
[02:55] We post things on LinkedIn as well and there are a lot of things
[02:58] coming out and changing in how we build software.
[03:02] So you can follow lovable underscore dev and you can follow me
[03:05] at Anton Oseka, right, at Twitter.
[03:09] I'd love more feedback on what people like where people see
[03:16] this is a huge change for them.
[03:18] There are a lot of people posting about that on Twitter,
[03:21] but we have a discord where you can share, like,
[03:23] oh, this is how I use lovable and what's super useful to me.
[03:27] And feedback.lovable.dev, you can ask for new features.
[03:35] There's a lot of people asking you about what features you want.
[03:38] So that's super useful.
[03:39] That's the most important thing for us.
[03:41] We just want to solve people's problems.
[03:43] Amazing. Anton, you're doing incredible work.
[03:45] What a what a journey.
[03:47] I'm excited to have you back someday when we see more
[03:50] chapters of this journey as do we all.
