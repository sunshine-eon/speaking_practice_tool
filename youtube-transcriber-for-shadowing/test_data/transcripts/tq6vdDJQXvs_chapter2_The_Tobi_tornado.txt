============================================================

[00:00] Toby, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast. I'm glad to be here. I'm excited
[00:08] for our conversation. I've listened to so many of your other interviews. I've talked to a bunch
[00:11] of people that work for you. I want to try to do something a little different. There's a couple
[00:16] themes. There's basically two themes that emerged over and over and over as I've listened to you
[00:20] shared advice and interview and in talking to people that work for you. One is thinking
[00:25] from first principles. The other is maximizing human potential. I'm just going to plant these
[00:31] seeds for now. I'm going to not ask about these directly. I'm going to come at these from the
[00:34] side with the many questions that I have for you. And the first question I have is something that
[00:40] I've heard people describe. A job I call the Toby tornado. Oh, wow. Okay. That's a start. I like
[00:48] it. What is the Toby tornado? Toby tornado, I would say is like a whole lot of change
[00:54] management or a conversation or conflict or we'll talk compressed into a very short time frame.
[01:02] I see something. It doesn't sound like it's not good. I have a conversation. If that isn't
[01:07] still mad and it's like I like I either learn something very quickly about, hey, I might I
[01:11] need to update my priors or cool. Let's do it differently at which point a project might be
[01:17] stopped and we get back together in a room and then we start a new version of the product and
[01:25] everyone who's currently on the team is no longer of that particular project, is no longer on the
[01:30] project, but they have the founders of the next version, which is built differently. And that
[01:34] might be a bit whiplashy for people. But it's also something that like, I mean, I mean, I
[01:41] certainly hope that's true with certainly what people tell me is something that they
[01:45] appreciate about a company, right? Like it's kind of like, what is best ends up mattering a lot?
[01:50] Basically, it's you going into chat room being like, hey, we're going to end this project.
[01:55] Let's try something else because you've discovered or realized this is a bad idea.
[01:59] What I see when I see this is some people complain about this practice of like, oh,
[02:03] Toby kill kills a project we've been working on. My lens is you realize we're just wasting
[02:09] time on this thing that is not going to work and we shouldn't do it. Is there anything there
[02:13] along those lines? No, this is everything. It's like, look at people. Again, once I imagine something
[02:20] might be not the right thing to work on, I'm either incorrect at which point this is super
[02:26] important that I understand why or I'm correct at which point it's super unfair for letting
[02:30] people work on something that isn't going to make it. There's a third way which is like,
[02:34] I could also ignore it, but that's like an abdication of my CEO and founder responsibility
[02:39] that I'm like absolutely not willing to make. So that's just not a that's not that's not a
[02:43] path forward that I see valid. I understand that's what a lot of people choose to do.
[02:49] So, yeah, like compressing time is important and
