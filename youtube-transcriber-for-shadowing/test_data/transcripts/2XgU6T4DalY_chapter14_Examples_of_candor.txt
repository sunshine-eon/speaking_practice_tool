============================================================

[00:00] Maybe a last question around just the culture. We talked about candor a bit.
[00:04] I'm just curious if there's an example that comes to mind of an example of candor that you recently
[00:08] saw or had to be the candid person that might be interesting to share where it's like, oh wow,
[00:14] that's what you mean when you say a culture of candor. There's a couple things that come to mind.
[00:21] I am generally a transparent leader, meaning I share information freely and openly. It's part
[00:31] of the culture to context, not control, which means part of my job is to make sure that people
[00:36] have the context they need to do their jobs well. And in practice, that means I take notes in leadership
[00:44] meetings and I share those notes with the whole organization. And that is sometimes it includes
[00:52] candor around reflections on things that aren't going well or problems we need to solve. Sometimes
[00:59] it's just letting people know here's what leadership is talking about so that they have a sense of what's
[01:04] top of mind. But it's a version of transparency that I feel strongly about. It doesn't exist a lot
[01:10] of other places. And I think it's a version of candor too in being able to share, we can't
[01:16] only share every detail of everything that we're talking about, but I do try to share things that
[01:20] probably push the boundary a little bit in the team feeling like they understand what's happening
[01:25] across the company and what I'm thinking about. And then there's a second example that comes to mind,
[01:30] which is until two years ago, individual contributors didn't have levels at Netflix.
[01:37] So all engineers were just senior engineers. All data scientists were senior data scientists.
[01:44] And we did not have a leveling system. We introduced IC levels two years ago, almost exactly.
[01:52] And it was a big, big, big shift because it was seen as something that was sort of sacred of it.
[01:59] A lot of people came to Netflix because we didn't have it. We didn't have process around promotions.
[02:04] This is probably part of why we never had performance reviews because
[02:08] promotions really weren't at play. And it gave people a sense of freedom of not having to worry
[02:13] about that type of structure. But when you get to a scale of an organization, we needed some type
[02:18] of scaffolding to say, we want to talk about how we compose teams. Like when do we need the person
[02:24] who has 30 years of experience? When do we want to have a new grad? Because that's what the work
[02:29] requires. We didn't have a language for it. So I introduced levels a couple years ago in it.
[02:36] We had quite a change roller coaster. It's the only way I can describe how it went.
[02:43] That's a good phrase.
[02:45] And I, yeah, it was sort of like being in like the tumble dry machine for a few months. And so
[02:51] really talking through it with the team. That's just context and backdrop for an example of Candor
[02:57] recently, which is we had kind of a postmortem or retro on how has it gone with IC levels.
[03:05] So it's kind of like Wells, not Wells. And I would normally think in a lot of cultures,
[03:12] it would be like, well, we got past that change, we're living that change. Like,
[03:16] don't don't reflect on it. Because that kind of opens some of that early debate. And I felt
[03:21] differently about it. I think it's a good example of being candid about this was a big change for
[03:26] us. It hasn't all gone perfectly. There's a lot that we can do better and how we implement levels
[03:31] at Netflix. And I would rather share that information than pretend it's all gone swimmingly. And we
[03:37] achieved every objective. So I think that I try to build examples like that, because I do think
[03:43] that level of candor and reflection helps build a sense of community and trust across the team.
