============================================================

So to protect and push notifications, I think are another example of how companies must consider how much is too much. Everyone seems to think, "Let's just send another push. It's fine. Just one more." I saw that your solution to that is having a person who acts as both the keeper and the gatekeeper of how far is too far. If you can have that, it’s beneficial. Push notifications are also easier to manage because there are many strategies you can implement, such as setting a budget cap for how many notifications to send. You can create policies around this. 

However, with many aspects, especially for Streak, it’s harder to create strict policies. A lot of it has to be guided by feel, so you really have to use your best judgment at times. 

Okay, any other lessons from this journey of what Streak has become today? You mentioned notifications, and I’ve touched on this a few times. It’s interesting how we often think we can just send another notification and it will be a win. At some point, though, it can lead to a bad experience, but it’s tough to see that in the moment. 

For instance, we send two notifications related to your core streak each day. The first is a practice reminder, which we send 23 and a half hours after you practiced the day before. If you practiced at noon today, we’ll send the reminder at 11:30 a.m. tomorrow. We did this because we assumed users would be free at the same time the next day. Initially, we let users set their own practice reminder time, thinking they would choose a time that worked for them. But life gets in the way, and what you think will work can change. 

What we realized is that the best indicator of when you should practice is when you practiced the day before. We’ve tried various complex logic systems, but what always wins is that 23 and a half hours. It’s about revealing behavior versus just guessing. 

The other notification we send is what we call a streak saver. This goes out at 10 o'clock at night if you haven’t extended your streak. We send a message saying, "Hey, it’s your last chance!" You might think that’s spammy or annoying to receive a notification from an app at 10 p.m., but we found that because people care about their streaks, which they associate with positive emotions, they don’t want to lose that. 

This late-night reminder is generally seen as a positive notification. It serves our purpose of getting users to come back and use their streaks. If you think about your notification strategy in relation to the features they’re tied to and how users perceive them, you can often get away with more. 

For us, this late-night message is highly impactful. It could be perceived as spammy, but many users appreciate it. I often find myself working late and forgetting to practice, and that reminder at 11:15 p.m. is really powerful. It has saved me many times. 

It’s funny how you hear stories about people extending their streaks. If you look around a Duolingo party, you’ll see employees doing a lesson at the last minute, or pictures of people in clubs or at concerts using Duolingo. It’s amusing how people react to the idea of losing their streak; they’ll go to great lengths to avoid it.
