Awesome. I love that. Coming back to this bootstrap path, there's a lot to love about it—independence, which trickles down to all the things you can do with your company that other companies aren't able to. For someone thinking about going down this path and wanting to bootstrap their company without a lot of money, because it takes cash to start a business, do you have any advice for just how to get started?

Yeah. First of all, it's hard. This is hard. I mean, when you have nothing, especially depending on where you are in your life, it can be even tougher. You may have a couple of kids, you don't have a lot of time, and you have to pay a mortgage. It's tough. But this is the reality for almost every business in the world that starts. 

So the best advice I could give you, and this sounds so trite but really it's true, is to stay as small as you can for as long as you can. The only thing you can really control are your costs. You can't control the alternatives in the market or the competition. You can't determine the market itself, the economy, or how much advertising costs, but you can control your own costs.

Another thing I would encourage people to do is to figure out how to do as much as they can on their own before they bring on a second person. Really work and struggle through something on your own. The moment you bring someone else on, you've got another mouth to feed. It becomes expensive, and you have another personality to deal with. The more you rely on them, if they turn out to be the wrong person, you have to lose them. Then you don’t have anyone to do the work that you now have them doing, and you’ve got to do it yourself. You’re not going to be any good at it.

So I would just say you’ve got to start as small as you possibly can and do as much of the work yourself as you can while keeping your costs in check. Don’t spend any money on branding. Don’t go get an office. Don’t spend anything on anything, basically, except for the tools you use. Let’s say it’s your laptop or whatever you’re going to use. Get a good one. They don’t cost much anymore—around $1500 or something like that. Get a really nice MacBook Air or whatever. 

You need an internet connection, and maybe you need to host somewhere. But use Squarespace to set up your site for $15 a month or whatever. Don’t go hire a web designer. Find all the efficiencies and keep your costs incredibly low. Don’t make things hard on yourself. 

This is the other thing that all businesses at every stage need to keep in mind. While it’s hard, things are relatively simple until you make them complicated. Simple can also be hard, but complicated is a lot harder. I think Brian Chesky had a really good bit on this, I think, on your podcast about how companies get complicated. I loved that. When I was hearing it, I kept envisioning this unfolding, complex shape that you almost can’t fold back. It’s so complicated now that you don’t even see where it came from. 

Now it is what it is, and you can’t put it back in the bottle. It’s just a mess, right? This happens really quickly, and it can happen at a small scale too. So these are a bunch of things, and none of this...
