============================================================

[00:00] There's also this cool down period after one of these, what do you call these, a sprint
[00:05] or what's the term for it?
[00:06] No, I hate that term.
[00:07] I don't like the word sprint because how do you feel after a sprint exhausted?
[00:12] But also pretty good, you know?
[00:14] You can.
[00:15] Yeah.
[00:16] Yeah.
[00:17] It's funny because I was a sprinter in high school, so I love sprinting.
[00:19] But if you go all out, you might feel high for a minute, but you can't go all
[00:25] out again.
[00:26] You've got to like, you know, really catch your breath.
[00:30] And you certainly like to sprint, I remember like my track coach actually ran in college
[00:35] for a year until I realized that wasn't good enough.
[00:37] But he made us run 2200s in a row with just like two minutes break in between.
[00:43] And the 200 is an incredibly hard race, you're all out for 200 meters or yards.
[00:48] And like after the fifth one, I just threw up, like I just like threw up.
[00:51] That's kind of what work is for a lot of people is like 2200s.
[00:55] Like they have these sprints and they never seem to end.
[00:57] And they one sprint after the other, after the other, after the other, after the other.
[01:00] And that's why I don't like the word because you can't layer that back to back to back to back.
[01:04] You cannot sprint back to back to back to back in life and you can't do it at work.
[01:09] I mean, people do it at work, but like, I don't think it actually works.
[01:13] So what we do is after our six week cycles, we typically take what we call a two week cool down.
[01:18] So we call these cycles, not sprints.
[01:21] A two week cool down.
[01:22] And we call them cycles because cycles happen again and again and again.
[01:27] Sprints like start and end cycles happen like there's cycles in life and seasons.
[01:32] And I like that idea that you're prepared for this thing to happen again.
[01:36] Take two weeks cool down.
[01:38] That's when people can sort of internally freelance.
[01:40] They're still working, but they're kind of tightening up a couple of things.
[01:43] Maybe we just shipped or working on a couple of extra days on something
[01:45] that didn't ship that's going to ship in two days or kind of fixing some
[01:49] bugs and messing around with some stuff that sort of they wanted to get to,
[01:52] but no one ever had time to and was never scheduled.
[01:54] So that's kind of a good time to do that.
[01:56] In the meantime, a few of us are shaping up the next cycles projects
[01:58] and finalizing that and writing the pitches up for that.
[02:01] So that's what those cycles are for.
[02:04] It's not that you're stopping work.
[02:05] It's that you're doing other kinds of work.
[02:08] And that I think is replenishing and refreshing.
[02:11] I think that's the important part versus back to back to back sprints
[02:15] of the same kind of work all the time.
