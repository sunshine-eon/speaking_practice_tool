============================================================

[00:00] Back this gets into the second bucket.
[00:01] So giving feedback, being candid around your expectations,
[00:06] when they're not being met,
[00:07] what could be better in helping people improve,
[00:10] and be able to receive that type of feedback yourself
[00:15] in order to keep talent density high.
[00:17] Because no one comes to Netflix as a perfect human being
[00:20] and stays a perfect human being the whole time.
[00:22] We all have ways that we could grow and improve.
[00:26] And so in order to keep that bar high,
[00:28] you have to be willing to have those types
[00:30] of very uncomfortable conversations.
[00:33] It's an uncomfortable amount of candor and feedback
[00:36] in order to keep that bar high.
[00:39] And then the other piece of it is another thing
[00:43] that doesn't come naturally to humans,
[00:45] which is making a call in pretty timely fashion
[00:52] if someone's not able to meet the bar.
[00:56] And to say either,
[00:57] I don't think the role you're sitting in is the right role
[01:00] or I don't think that Netflix is the right place for you.
[01:05] And to make that something that is part of best practice,
[01:11] to get to a point where you could make that decision.
