============================================================

Speaking of enduring, you've been at this for almost 25 years now, I believe. Have there been periods where, like, that sigh that you just had there? It's a long time. So maybe along that path, is there a point at which you started going off-track and realized, "This is not what I want to be doing, why did I do this to myself?" And then, what have you learned being at this for this long?

Over the past few years, I've had more thoughts about how long I should do this for, and I go back and forth. What's interesting is that right now, I'm probably more excited than I've been in many years. A year ago, I was not so excited. After you've been doing this for a while, you tend to compare what it was like in the early days to what it's like now. All the new things that are harder weren't hard before, and now they're hard today. Do I like doing this kind of hard work? Would I rather do something else? You just kind of amass this history, and so you tend to look back and reminisce about the early days. It was so much easier when we were 20 people, but we weren't doing this, and times were different. You can't go back anyway.

Next year, I'll be 50, and we'll be celebrating 25 years in the business. I've been running this company for 25 years. Part of me thinks, "Is that enough? Maybe that's enough." But right now, I'm really excited about what we're doing. We're doing some great product work—probably the best we've done in many years—launching this new thing called Once, which hopefully will lead to three or so products next year under that category. I would like to write another book; we finally have another idea for one. There's this outpouring of energy right now.

I'm trying to be very conscious of my energy levels. Right now, I'm getting energy from the business. There have been times in the past where the business sapped energy from me. If it saps too much, you start to think, "Is it worth it? Do I want to keep doing this?" Right now, I'm fueled again by it, but I don't know what it will be like in a year from now. I really don't know, and I think I'm more conscious of that than I've ever been, given how long I've been doing this.

I always have this strange fantasy—I'm curious about what someone else would do with this place. What if someone else could just step in tomorrow? How would they run it? No one's ever had a chance to run it but me. What would they do differently? I'd have to be completely detached from it to let them really run with it, but I always wonder about that.

I think they would probably focus on growth. There are opportunities that we miss all the time. We are stuck in a certain groove. Stuck sounds like a negative term, but I don't mean it that way. We do things the way we do things. We change here and there, but we're not really jumping into a new groove. Someone else would likely jump into a new groove and run the company differently, maybe make a lot more products than we're making today, or resurrect a couple of things we did in the past. They might spend a lot on advertising and marketing, possibly taking our margin way down to focus on growth. 

What if we spent 70% of our margin on growth? What would that look like? I feel like that's what most people would probably do with a business like ours. They would see so many missed opportunities and think, "Look at this and look at that." If people knew about us and we got 100,000 paying customers, think about all the things we could do. I'm not really thinking about all the things we could do; I'm focused on what we're doing. 

It would be interesting to live in a reality where there could be a second reality running right alongside you. Not like an A-B test, which is hard to do. You can't really A-B test an entire company. Obviously, I'm seeking to A-B test small things, but it would be cool if that could happen. Maybe there's some simulation down the road. 

If I were to bring in any leader, what would they do? This is a weird way to think about it, but I almost feel embarrassed by what someone would come in and see. They might say, "My God, you guys are missing so many opportunities here." And I'd be like, "Yeah, I know, I know we are, but I'm totally fine with it." There would be this moment of judgment and reckoning, realizing how much we're leaving on the table. 

You could have five different pricing tiers and make a lot more money. You could maximize this and that, address this market. I have special versions of Basecamp—churches are using Basecamp. We could create special versions for churches, synagogues, religious institutions, education, or nonprofits. Think of all the slight variations we could do. I'm certain all those opportunities exist on the table, but they don't interest me personally in terms of making multiple products. 

I can see someone else going, "There's a huge opportunity here. We have to pursue this." I'd be really proud if someone did that and made the business bigger and better. I could never have done that, but right now, we're running it our way.
