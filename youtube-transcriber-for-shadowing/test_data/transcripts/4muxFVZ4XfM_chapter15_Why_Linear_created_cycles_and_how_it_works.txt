============================================================

[00:00] And then another core element of the linear method is something called cycles.
[00:04] And I know linear is all around this idea of creating cycles and working in cycles.
[00:08] You talk about what is a cycle and how it works at linear.
[00:12] So for example, like the cycles is it's optional.
[00:15] Like not every team has to use it or not.
[00:17] The whole company has to use it, but it's there as you can turn it on or off.
[00:21] But basically, I think why we created cycles is that I think any team that works on software
[00:28] or some other products, like you always have almost like infinite list of things to do.
[00:33] And that list gets longer every day.
[00:36] And it can be sometimes very distracting for the individual or for the team to like decide like what,
[00:43] like there's a new thing coming in like should we work on that or should we work on this other thing we decided in the past.
[00:49] So the cycles is just a way to say that like, like for the next week or the next two weeks or whatever time frame,
[00:56] we are going to work on these things.
[00:58] And like these are the things we think like are the priority or the focus for this time frame.
[01:03] And then the team can kind of try to focus on those things.
[01:06] Now if something happens like, I don't know, we really need to jump on this other thing.
[01:11] At least there was like some kind of initial state that like we decided before we want to do these things.
[01:17] And then now something else happened.
[01:19] And so now we have to go on this thing.
[01:21] So so you have like an answer when someone comes to you to ask like, why didn't you do this other thing before?
[01:27] Then you can say, well, we did decide to do that.
[01:30] But then something happened and we had to do this other thing.
[01:32] So the cycles and so it's very similar to sprints.
[01:35] But we like to call it cycles because we are not really sprinting anywhere.
[01:39] The cycles also run on like automated schedule.
[01:42] So it's like, you don't have to think about like which day does it start or or like every every time like set it up manually.
[01:49] So it's just like runs automatically.
[01:51] And so it's just meant to like to help the team to focus on like let's just like focus on this few things and forget about the infinite list of other things that are are in the background.
