Video: How Revolut trains world-class PMs: The “Local CEO” model, raw intellect & building wow products
Time: 15:50 - 25:00
============================================================

[00:00] So is there anything else just kind of along those lines as I say that that you think is important?
[00:04] I would probably add an obsession with building Wow product.
[00:12] Wow, W-O-W.
[00:14] W-O-W.
[00:16] And, you know, I think in Fintech overall, this is probably the most neglected part, usually.
[00:23] But it's also a part that we at Revolute, we pay enormous attention to.
[00:28] So it's not only, you know, when you do a trade in the app or when you send money,
[00:35] it's very important for it to be very fast and cheap process for you so that you don't pay a lot of fees.
[00:43] But we also pay a lot of attention to look and feel of the app and how smooth it is and how
[00:51] frictionless the process.
[00:54] Not only we invest into reducing clicks and optimizing finals, but we also want people to feel that we really cared about them.
[01:06] We also want people to feel that we love our customers and we applied extra effort for the product to look great and feel great.
[01:19] And I hear this a lot from our customers.
[01:23] Like the app is something they really love and it helps them solve their problems.
[01:28] It's at least one of the ingredients of the company success.
[01:32] And I think people that work at Revolute, they built habit of, you know, paying attention to these small nuances, small details that make the product lovable.
[01:41] And then second is handling these contacts because, you know, like it's a lot of details where you need to dive, but there are also a lot of dimensions where you need to dive into different details.
[01:56] Right. And I think this ability to keep this like large context in your mind and consider second order effects and like view subject from multiple angles.
[02:10] I think that this is also a very important skill that people usually train at Revolute.
[02:14] Okay, cool. So if three bullet points on the ingredients of great product managers slash owners that you guys incubate.
[02:23] On this wow piece, which I love, how do you operationalize this sort of thing?
[02:27] Imagine a big part of it is hiring people that are really good at this and value building lovable products.
[02:32] Is there any way you kind of have a process around making sure the things you ship are wow and lovable?
[02:37] Two things that you need to understand about how Revolute operates is that we operate in small lean teams that are tasked to build products and,
[02:47] as I mentioned, like, and having an entrant responsibility for products and usually they're the ones who built it from zero and then they're growing and developing this product.
[02:56] And then another thing is that company is very flat and hierarchy is very flat.
[03:03] We still have our founders, Nick and Vlad, very hands on,
[03:09] going down to details for every product and every part of the business.
[03:14] And every week they have product reviews with every team,
[03:21] giving an opportunity to every product owner present directly to CEO and CTO
[03:28] and show what increment has team achieved in the last week,
[03:34] but also get steering from founders, which is super valuable.
[03:41] So essentially founders of the company,
[03:44] they still review 100% of screens that have been shipped.
[03:49] And everything that you will see in the app, this past this review,
[03:53] and there are a lot of eyeballs that were, you know,
[03:57] scrutinizing this and thinking of all possible edge cases and
[04:04] nuances that we need to consider to make sure that
[04:07] every single customer will be happy in this product, in this flow.
[04:12] That seems to be a consistent theme in products that are incredible as the founders are deeply involved in the experience and review everything.
[04:20] How many product owners are there at Revolute, just to give people a sense, by the way?
[04:25] Oh, I'm afraid to say it's already more than 150 people, maybe 170.
[04:30] Cool. That's what I would expect.
[04:33] You said that there's kind of these three types.
[04:35] There's kind of like the edge type, the PM traditional type, and there's the data product owner.
[04:40] When you hire the UX type of product owner,
[04:43] is there previous role, usually a product manager at another company?
[04:46] Yes. But I would say that
[04:51] not necessarily it's a very experienced product manager.
[04:54] Well, maybe even it's way more important
[04:58] to have this hunger for building things, you know, and
[05:05] having the raw intellect.
[05:09] And we always try to find people with
[05:12] these intrinsic traits rather than, you know, hiring people who are very experienced, but maybe
[05:20] are not super excited about building things.
[05:23] What percentage of your product owners come from internal transfers from other functions?
[05:28] It's a quite substantial part of product owners who eventually become very successful, by the way.
[05:34] So it's like a positive self-select.
[05:37] So it means that someone already succeeded in another role.
[05:42] So it's a guaranteed culture mesh.
[05:44] It's a guaranteed domain knowledge.
[05:49] And then they simply grow.
[05:51] Usually it could be operations managers or engineers.
[05:56] They grow into someone who now manages the team.
[06:00] And that's why it's a very successful path.
[06:03] So the other company on the list of top three companies that produced and hired the best PMs,
[06:07] according to the research I've done, Palantir.
[06:09] I just had someone that was at Palantir for a long time and we talked about exactly all the same
[06:14] questions. And interestingly, so far we have kind of these three bullet points
[06:18] in terms of what product owners within Revolute get to do.
[06:23] There's a lot of ownership.
[06:24] There's a lot of depth and complexity.
[06:25] And there's a lot of focus on while lovable products.
[06:29] So interestingly at Palantir, also tons of ownership, also tons of depth and complexity.
[06:35] The other ingredient that I want to ask you about is they also,
[06:37] they have this concept of a forward deployed engineer where they put an engineer in the
[06:41] office of the company they're building the product from.
[06:43] They sit there building it for them with them.
[06:46] And so there's a lot of skills built in terms of understanding customer problems,
[06:52] talking to customers, getting empathy, building things like that.
[06:55] Is there anything you guys do or focus on around just like talking to customers,
[06:59] a way you approach having your product owners work with customers,
[07:02] understand problems, things like that that might be helpful for people to hear?
[07:05] For us, it's a bit easy to reach out to customers simply because the customer base is so big.
[07:12] It's more than 50 million people and usually we ourselves are power users of the product.
[07:20] We receive our salary into Revolute and then we spend with Revolute.
[07:25] Our friends the same.
[07:26] So it's like a no brainer to talk to people continuously.
[07:32] And even if you're not practicing in an ad doc, they will reach out.
[07:36] If you have a problem in the product, I guarantee that we know about it very, very soon.
[07:44] We've also built tools for product owners and designers to have an easy access
[07:50] to a panel of users by different tools so that they can just start an interview and process
[07:57] or survey or a test of different designs in a few clicks.
[08:02] For me, it was very important to build this direct connection to customers because
[08:09] when you delegate such an important thing as customer research and collecting their feedback
[08:13] back to someone, you will get refined the filtered version.
[08:19] You won't get this nuances of how people describe things, which emotions they feel
[08:27] like and so on and where they think.
[08:29] It's very easy to lose all those important bytes of information in this process.
[08:34] So I'm a strong believer that it's very important to have direct communication channel to customers.
[08:42] And as you describe this, it's funny how you guys are the extreme opposite end of the spectrum
[08:47] from Palantir in terms of how easy it is for you to get feedback.
[08:51] They build stuff for the government and for Airbus where employees would never use a product
[08:57] like that or need a product like that.
[08:59] You guys are getting paid in Revolute using Revolute to pay for things and constantly in
[09:04] the product.
[09:04] And so I could see why there's less of a need for something like a forward to play engineer.
[09:08] Okay, amazing.
