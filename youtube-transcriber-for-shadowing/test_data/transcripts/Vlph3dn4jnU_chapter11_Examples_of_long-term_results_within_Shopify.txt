============================================================

[00:00] So maybe just to dig into this again, because it's so interesting.
[00:03] Basically, product teams ship stuff, they run an experiment, they see impact,
[00:07] say it's 5% lift on something.
[00:09] Ha-ha-huzzah! You did it, great work, performance review, your exceeds,
[00:13] you're doing great, this team's killing it.
[00:15] And then a year later, you realize, oh, that didn't last.
[00:19] How often do you find like a team that is shipping wins, looks back,
[00:23] and ends up seeing like, oh, that wasn't actually as successful as it?
[00:26] I know you said like, maybe it's like a third of the time.
[00:28] The 30. Yeah.
[00:29] Yeah. Okay. So it's still like roughly, yeah.
[00:32] And it's great learning.
[00:33] And that's what we take it as like, wow, okay, now we really uncovered something.
[00:36] And it's like such a successful discovery.
[00:39] Wow. Okay. We thought this thing, but now we learned it actually wasn't as true as we thought.
[00:44] Cool. What can we take from that and be smarter next time?
[00:49] So we don't just double down on the wrong, the wrong things.
[00:52] It's so interesting.
[00:52] And again, you mentioned most of the reason this is the case
[00:55] when something doesn't show lift down the road is it's pulling forward success.
[00:59] That would have been seen later on its own if you had not even shipped this thing.
[01:04] Correct. Awesome.
[01:05] Is there an example by any chance that comes to mind of something like that?
[01:07] That's just like, wow, that was a big win.
[01:09] And then like, oh, I see, we just pulled forward some revenue from the future.
[01:14] Yeah. So I think one good example is something around payment failure notifications.
[01:18] So one of the things that a lot of teams have or see is what's called
[01:21] dunning effects where somebody might have a payment, not go through a credit card
[01:26] that doesn't go through.
[01:27] So we did a bunch of experimentation around, hey, how can we alert people
[01:31] that their credit card is failed, their payment attempt failed?
[01:37] And that's a typical kind of growth win usually produces a lot of short-term impact.
[01:42] And that's what we saw here.
[01:42] We were doing much better alerting, reminding people, sending them a million emails about it.
[01:47] Cool. We got some pretty major lift.
[01:49] You look back six, 12 months, there was really no long-term lift.
[01:55] And why is that?
[01:57] Because there's really a little bit of a selection bias there,
[01:59] the people who are letting that payment fail probably weren't actually
[02:05] that dedicated to this entrepreneurship craft.
[02:08] They may have updated their credit card, but they still really weren't in it.
[02:12] And so that was a good example of a bunch of this stuff around kind of payments,
[02:16] even, quote, preventing churn when you look like it's six, 12, 18 months on a GMV metric,
[02:24] not a lot of lift over that long-term horizon.
[02:27] I love this example.
[02:29] Like, I could see so many people having run experiments like this and like,
[02:33] oh, we found such a huge win, whoo-hoo.
[02:35] This seems killing.
[02:36] It was a great idea.
[02:38] Of course, this makes sense, duh.
[02:40] And then it turns out it's nothing long-term.
[02:43] Yeah, which is great because we were spending,
[02:46] you know, we were going to spend a lot of time kind of, okay, what else can we do here?
[02:49] It's like, no, actually, bigger fish to fry in some, in a lot of other areas.
[02:55] So just, it helps the team just feel really good that their work is really the things that were good.
[03:03] You know, another one that went the other way, which is really interesting,
[03:06] was in our online store, this might be, if you shopify,
[03:12] you have sections and blocks that come pre-configured.
[03:16] And so we tested, okay, if we give you a pre-configured block of like,
[03:20] you should have an image up top, then a text banner,
[03:23] and then a collage with your products,
[03:26] that should help folks understand what to do when they're building the online store.
[03:32] It actually had no lift in people converting to a paying merchant.
[03:38] However, when we looked longer-term on that six months later,
[03:41] it had a pretty massive impact on the number of people who were selling and producing GMV.
[03:46] And why is that?
[03:48] Because it didn't likely really influence anyone to like buy Shopify or pay for Shopify,
[03:55] but the people who used it created better stores that were higher converting.
[04:01] And so they got early sales, they actually converted one of their visitors,
[04:05] and they got momentum, and they stuck with entrepreneurship a little bit longer.
[04:08] And we saw that in that opposite way.
[04:11] And so this is an example of that neutral.
[04:13] So we tend to ship neutral.
[04:15] It's like, it could be positive.
[04:17] And so let's like, let it go if we have good intuition about it, and it will turn.
[04:22] So we've seen a bunch of these things go in very different directions.
