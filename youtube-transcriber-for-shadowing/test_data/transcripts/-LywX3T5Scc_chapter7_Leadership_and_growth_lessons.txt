============================================================

[00:00] consistent through.
[00:01] I'm guessing a lot of founders ask for your advice on raising money, getting started,
[00:06] having gone through so much rejection early on.
[00:08] What do you, what's your general advice to folks that are having a hard time fundraising?
[00:12] I mean, I can only go on my experience, but I think it's sort of like the dark tunnel analogy.
[00:18] Oh, chaos to clarity.
[00:19] Let's go with that one.
[00:20] It's a slightly friendlier analogy.
[00:22] And I think just taking the rejection and turning into things that you can control.
[00:27] So I can control my pitch deck.
[00:28] I can control the number of people I'm speaking to.
[00:30] And I just spoke to literally everyone.
[00:32] And I think that like continuing to use it to refine it rather than taking it as a personal rejection.
[00:38] I think it's really important to think like, how can I improve?
[00:41] How can I help someone to understand it?
[00:43] Some people are never going to understand it.
[00:45] I remember pitching an investor that had the lean startup book on their behind them when they were when I was pitching them.
[00:52] And they were never going to like Canva because we were not the lean startup.
[00:57] That was not the way that we're approaching it whatsoever.
[00:59] So there's some people that are just going to never like you.
[01:02] And that's OK.
[01:03] I think it's important to find some people that do like what you're trying to say and trying to do.
[01:08] And kind of finding your tribe, I think.
[01:10] I think as an investor, this is really interesting to hear because it tells you there are companies like Canva out there that everyone's turning down.
[01:17] A hundred investors passed on that you might still be able to invest in.
[01:21] Talking about your growth as a leader, say if you compared Melanie of today to Melanie of 12, 13 years ago when you were just starting Canva.
[01:31] What would you say is most different in terms of leadership?
[01:34] I don't really know.
[01:35] Probably if you asked other people around me, they'd probably be more observant.
[01:40] But it is funny because there's some things that I think that I need to change.
[01:44] And then I realize like, you know, go into it the same as some other company.
[01:47] And sometimes we even try that for a while and then we try that out and we're like, that's, you know, it didn't really work for us.
[01:54] And it's kind of like building a house that you want every brick in the house to match.
[01:58] And if you go and try and take some bricks from someone else's house and stick it in your house, it's probably going to not look very matched.
[02:04] And so trying to find things that are authentic to us and are authentic to the everything that's come before it is just that constant, constant thing.
[02:12] And like then each scale of each stage of scale of the company, rather than going and taking someone else's bricks and trying to stick that in your house,
[02:20] trying to build the thing that's authentic.
[02:23] So I think there's many things that are the same, but obviously the stage and scale and the, you know, we're constantly having to give away hats.
[02:29] And so you kind of think about it in the very early days, we're just a few of us, or just two of us in fusion and then three of us and just a little tiny group.
[02:38] And you kind of wear a hundred hats and then you have to be able to give away those hats to other people that can then do that way better than yourself.
[02:44] And so I'm sure there's been a few skills, I guess I would have had to have developed over the last decade to be able to give away those hats.
[02:51] But yeah, I think there's a lot of things that we've had to do and double down on that was more authentic to the way we did it in the early days, actually.
[03:01] I love that story. I think, again, if anyone working at a company that has gone through a lot of growth has experienced that when people from other companies come in and here's how we did it at this company, is there an example of some there that just like here's something that this company brought in and people from this company thought we should do and we tried and didn't work?
[03:18] I'm not going to specific examples, but so many times over.
[03:22] And I think that maybe that's probably in answer to your other question.
[03:26] Like not how we did things our way because that was the only way we knew.
[03:30] And there was many, many times over the years that were like didn't have confidence in the way we were doing things and we'd be like, oh, they've done it from a big company that's bigger than our company.
[03:38] Let's go do that.
[03:39] And that hasn't always worked out so well for us.
[03:43] And so yeah, I think confidence in how we take what is authentic to us and do it at the next level of scale is a constant work in progress.
[03:53] It feels like, as I was saying before, systems break and need to be reinvented, but also reimagined for that next layer of scale rather than going to try to get something off the shelf from another company.
[04:03] And mentioned also help that you're in Australia away from the Bay Area and where all these other big companies are at, just being able to do it your own way.
[04:11] Yeah, very much so.
[04:13] Did you know that I have a whole team that helps me with my podcast and with my newsletter?
