[00:00] on any of these things.
[00:01] Awesome.
[00:02] A second question comes from Leo Polovitz,
[00:04] one of my favorite VCs.
[00:06] He works at Seuss Adventures.
[00:07] And he asked the question that a lot of people actually asked
[00:09] is just, what does he think he got right
[00:12] and where does he change his mind, if anywhere?
[00:15] You share a lot of strong opinions,
[00:17] very contrarian opinions.
[00:18] So maybe just mostly on that second part
[00:20] is what I'm most curious about.
[00:21] What have you changed your mind about?
[00:23] A few years, well, a handful of years ago
[00:25] we switched back to, we used to make multiple products.
[00:28] And then we went to just doing base camp.
[00:31] And I thought I would be personally satisfied
[00:34] for the rest of my career working on one thing
[00:37] and just making that thing the best it could possibly be.
[00:39] Essentially working on one sculpture
[00:41] and constantly tweaking it and chiseling it
[00:43] and polishing it and just making it better and better
[00:45] and better and better and better.
[00:46] And I still thoroughly enjoy working on base camp.
[00:50] But a few years ago, we built this new thing called
[00:52] hey, h-e-y.com, email service,
[00:54] because we just felt like we had to make more things again.
[00:57] And so this idea that I thought
[00:59] that we could be happy as a company
[01:01] just doing one thing really well,
[01:03] which was a major shift.
[01:05] We had multiple products.
[01:07] We basically wound those down.
[01:09] We didn't ever close them down.
[01:11] People can still use them who were using them before.
[01:12] We just stopped selling them.
[01:14] We even changed the name of the business
[01:15] from 37 signals to base camp.
[01:18] So we were saying, we're signaling all through.
[01:20] We're doing one thing.
[01:21] It's just this thing called base camp.
[01:23] It's a huge, massive decision to make.
[01:26] And so we were all in on it.
[01:28] And then a few years ago, we go,
[01:30] you know what, we're makers.
[01:31] Let's be honest about ourselves.
[01:33] And I'm talking about me and I was talking about David.
[01:35] But we're just like, we wanna make more things again.
[01:37] We have some more ideas.
[01:38] And why are we suppressing ourselves?
[01:41] Let's not do that.
[01:42] And so we made, hey, and now we're doing it once
[01:45] and we're gonna make more products
[01:46] and more products and more products.
[01:47] We're gonna probably do another book,
[01:48] as I mentioned earlier.
[01:50] So it was that.
[01:52] I think that's the biggest,
[01:54] major fundamental 180 degree change
[01:56] that I've changed my mind on.
[01:59] But I changed my mind all the time.
[02:01] I disagree with myself constantly on small things.
[02:06] So product design decisions or the naming of something
[02:10] or how we roll something out
[02:11] or how I'm gonna write something
[02:12] or present something or say something.
[02:13] There's probably an answer.
[02:14] I'm sure there's an answer in this podcast
[02:16] that if I'd listen back,
[02:17] I would probably answer it differently.
[02:19] Like, eh, or I don't even agree
[02:20] with the way I answered that.
[02:22] I mean, there's a million things
[02:23] like that happening all the time.
[02:24] But in terms of big things,
[02:25] I think that's the best example I can come up with.
