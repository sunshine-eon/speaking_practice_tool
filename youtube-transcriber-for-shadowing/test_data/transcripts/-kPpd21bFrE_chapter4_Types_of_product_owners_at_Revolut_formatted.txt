I love this because it's so fun just to learn about such different ways of operating. Another fact that I saw is that there's two types of product donors: UX product donors and technical product donors. We actually have three. The third type becomes increasingly more important. The first type is UX product owners, then there are technical product owners, and finally, there are data science product owners. 

UX product owners are the ones who work on the consumer-facing part of the product. Usually, they have a great taste for things and they understand what constitutes UX that will work and which things will not work. They also have expertise in the industry. Technical product owners, on the other hand, delve deepest into details. Usually, those are former engineers who grew into making decisions and driving business. Data science product owners are typically former data scientists who decided to grow into management positions but are still very hands-on.

You know what? There are way more things that are common to each of these three specializations. What we see sometimes is people just shifting them because I would say that what defines the specialization is probably 5-10-15%, while 85-90% is common to each one of them. Those commonalities include being a great problem solver and having a great linear thinking approach, as well as a creative approach towards nonlinear problems. 

Building context for the customer and developing empathy towards them is crucial, as is translating that understanding into the team. Additionally, going down to details very deeply is essential because, in our domain, there are no obvious things. You need to get to the root cause of the problem to understand what will work and what will not work. This means that you also need to be quite technical. Even if you're an expert, you still need to often go as deep as sitting with engineers and reading code. 

I would also emphasize the importance of business acumen because we tend to measure and quantify product performance a lot. You need to understand what things we will build that will eventually drive business metrics and targets. I love this idea of product owners having to go really deep. I think a lot of people hearing this believe they can go deep and truly understand the details of what they're working on. 

I'm curious if there's an example that's illustrative of what you actually mean here. For example, to provide the best possible product in every country of presence, we need to have the necessary licenses. In Europe, this means that we need to launch local branches of our European bank. For instance, a branch for France, a branch for Germany, or a branch for Italy. To launch a branch, you need to fully comply with all necessary regulations. You need to report necessary data on customers to various regulators and authorities, and you need to register with local payment systems. Each of these tasks has a lot of projects nested within.

We have a very lean team of just a few people who need to scope everything and do it at the scale of 50 countries. The way we do it is by going very deep on examples of each of these projects. For instance, we launched a branch in Ireland and a branch in the Netherlands, then we reverse-engineered what the best process was to do it. We then went back to the top level and asked, "What's the ideal framework for doing this at scale?" 

We formalized it into a process—really like an algorithmic process with steps, quality gates, assignees, and determining what people we need to hire and how soon we need to start doing that before we want to launch a new country. It's not only about going deep, but also about being flexible, switching between zooming in very deep and then raising to a helicopter view. This allows us to understand that while things may seem very complex in detail, we can simplify them when we zoom out and build a robust, scalable process around them.

As you're talking and we go through this chat, I'm keeping track of what I think contributes to your alumni product owners and product managers becoming so successful. A couple of things so far that I think are probably contributing to this are having a lot of ownership over what they're building, which leads to developing skills to start companies and become leaders at other companies. These product owners essentially act as GMs of whatever product they're working on. 

Then there's this depth in complexity where you have to really get good at understanding a problem deeply. I imagine many of these people go on to work on something like that layer somewhere else because they've spent all this time honing their skills, or they just get really good at dealing with complex, multi-layered problems.
