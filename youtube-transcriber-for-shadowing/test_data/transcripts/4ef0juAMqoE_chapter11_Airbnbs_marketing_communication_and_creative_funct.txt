Video: Brian Chesky’s new playbook

============================================================

[00:00] We also started really building out much more of a marketing communications and creative function.
[00:05] We built our own in-house creative agency.
[00:08] So we use production partners, but we don't use Widen and Kennedy or Scheiter in those anymore.
[00:12] We actually build our own in-house agency, so to speak, which is a creative group.
[00:17] The creative group does a lot of the, not just the ads, but the creative on the product.
[00:23] So we got really, really functional.
[00:25] We got rid of a function called UX writing, and we combined it with marketing writing.
[00:30] We said, wait, aren't the best writers, like, why don't we just have the best writers do everything?
[00:35] Why is UX writing a separate function?
[00:37] Because actually the emails, the ads should all be one voice.
[00:41] Now, there may be people that come from a different background, like there are people
[00:45] that come from UX, but they all roll up to one function of writing.
[00:48] And writing should not go to design.
[00:51] Writing should go to a function called writing, unless you want your head of writing to report
[00:54] to design, then that doesn't make sense.
[00:57] So we really made a lot of those changes.
[01:00] Just to round up the question that you asked, I think that way too many founders
[01:07] apologize for how they want to run the company.
[01:10] I don't know why they do, but I think they apologize for how they run the company.
[01:14] They basically find some midpoint between how they want to run a company
[01:19] and how the people they lead want to run the company.
