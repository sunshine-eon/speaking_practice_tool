Of this episode, I want to move to our second big idea, which is about something you've called the LNO framework. This framework is all around prioritizing your finite time as a PM and as a team. So, I'll just kind of turn it over to you to share what that's all about.

Yes. I'm going to share a short personal anecdote related to the LNO framework. When I just joined Google as a relatively new PM back in 2008, I was overwhelmed and stressed for the first three years. I was in a high-performance environment, working on important products and launches, and I just had too much to do. Looking back, that was perhaps the most stressful time of my career. I would work long hours, but even at the end of the day, I felt highly dissatisfied because my to-do list was endless, and I wasn't able to make a dent in it. 

I was also a bit of a perfectionist, thinking I needed to do everything well. I would come home and talk to my wife, basically complaining about how I wasn't able to make as much progress as I wanted. This was accompanied by sleepless nights, as I was concerned about my output. Again, it was a very stressful time in my career. Things changed when I discovered the ideas related to the LNO framework in a blog post. Unfortunately, I can't find that blog post anymore, but it had some ideas that I took and then created this LNO framework for myself.

Essentially, as a product manager or anyone in a creative, high-impact, high-leverage role, not all tasks are created equal. There are three types of tasks that you end up doing in such a role. First, there are L tasks, which are leverage tasks. These are tasks where, when you put in a certain amount of effort, you get 10x or 100x in return in terms of impact. Then, there are neutral tasks, or N tasks, where you get what you put in or just a little more than that—put in 1x and get 1.1x back. Finally, there are overhead tasks, or O tasks, where you get back a lot less than you actually put in.

It turns out that many ambitious people or perfectionists, like myself, tend to treat each of these types of tasks the same way, and therein lies the problem. This was the epiphany for me back at Google when I discovered these ideas. I realized that among the things on my to-do list, there were actually only a few L tasks. It made sense for me to focus on those L tasks, taking them on when I was feeling most productive and energetic during certain times of the day. For the L tasks, I allowed my inner perfectionist to shine because I would get so much more in return.

For instance, it made sense to spend more time on a PRD related to an important feature that would meaningfully impact our revenue. Now, where does that extra time come from? It cannot come from just working more hours; it comes from spending less time on N tasks and O tasks. A classic example of an O task is an expense report. It sounds silly, but I used to try to make my expense reports really good, which made no sense. 

I realized that the same type of activity can actually be either an L task, N task, or O task. For example, filing a bug report can be an L task if you need to file a detailed report for a significant issue. In that case, you want to provide a very explicit bug report. However, in other situations, it might be an O task where you don't fill out the template diligently and just submit it with minimal details.

Another example is taking notes. Taking notes, synthesizing them, and sharing them can also be an L task, N task, or O task, depending on the context. Previously, I would send all notes with great detail, which took a lot of time. However, I learned that for standard meetings, I only needed to list the three action items and who owns them. In that case, I would send the notes immediately after the meeting. On the other hand, if it was a product review with the CEO about a contentious topic, I would spend more time perfecting those notes to ensure clarity and avoid misinterpretation.

Hopefully, that helps illustrate some of the ideas behind the LNO framework. The last piece is a really good segue to the next big idea around optics and the important optics.

Sprig is a user research platform that makes getting user insights from your product as easy and fast as getting analytics. The best product and research teams and companies like Lume, Open Door, and Dropbox use Sprig's in-product surveys to target specific users, start collecting insights, and identify issues and opportunities related to activation, onboarding, engagement, and more. 

Talk about a platform that pays for itself! But I'm perhaps most excited about Sprig's newest launch, which extends the power of the platform pre-launch and makes it possible to test mockups and prototypes with your own users in minutes. The testing interface is super slick and doesn't require any of the typical plugins that make testing with your own users unappealing. With unlimited seats, you're able to invite anyone from your company to view and use insights generated by Sprig.

But before we get to that, I wanted to have one follow-up.
