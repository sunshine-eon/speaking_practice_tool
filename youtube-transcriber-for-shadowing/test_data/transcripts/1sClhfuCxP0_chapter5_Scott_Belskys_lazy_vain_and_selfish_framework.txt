============================================================

[00:00] So there's very interesting insight that I heard from Scott Belsky from Adobe and then
[00:05] now he's doing like very interesting stuff.
[00:08] And that kind of stayed with me and which was you have to think about users on modern
[00:13] internet consumers having three attributes.
[00:16] So they are lazy, they are vain and they're selfish.
[00:20] So lazy meaning I don't have time for this.
[00:23] So blow my mind away.
[00:25] Otherwise I'm not going to pay attention.
[00:28] Which means I have a habit.
[00:30] I'm solving this problem in a particular way.
[00:33] And here you come with your two-pack product and asking me to change my habit.
[00:37] Do you really expect me to do that?
[00:39] That second that's their inherent attribute.
[00:41] And the third one is that they're selfishly.
[00:43] Show me what's in it for me.
[00:45] And once you start thinking about users in that way and if these users are not even
[00:51] using your product, suddenly you realize, oh my God, it's quite difficult.
[00:56] Even how do I attract this kind of customer?
[00:58] And if my marketing team has done a good job at bringing this user to my product,
[01:04] how do I actually empathize with this lazy, selfish and vain customer and build my product
[01:09] in a way so that I can make this wear on your side?
[01:12] Like this is the thing that you have to use.
[01:15] The way you write your copy, the way you build your onboarding, the way you do your first warm welcome,
[01:21] it's going to make the biggest amount of change in terms of your product success than your
[01:27] core product features that you're going to build for your loyal consumers.
[01:30] So that one insight and I've seen and applied that multiple times,
[01:33] not only the companies that I've worked with, the companies I've consulted and spoken with,
[01:38] most neglected, well, the kind of get user onboarding is important,
[01:41] but just how important is that is one.
[01:44] And B, it's a craft of thinking like a user who is lazy, vain and selfish and basically
[01:50] rejecting all your products.
[01:51] This does not work for this kind of customer.
[01:53] It's extremely hard.
[01:54] It's very hard, but it's totally worth it if you put that lens on.
[01:59] And is there an example of you're using this framework on a product you worked on where you just like,
[02:04] here's the thing we really did.
[02:05] I don't know how to big impact or it's really surprised everyone.
[02:09] So I've used it in like two different areas.
[02:11] So one is, of course, products I worked on.
[02:14] So I worked in Swiggy for the last seven years and really when we started working towards this user,
[02:19] instead of thinking about everybody as, you know, this is what our onboarding experience looks like
[02:24] and this is what our product is.
[02:26] So essentially, we used to basically say that it's, we are a food delivery app,
[02:30] we are a grocery delivery app and we have like these bunch of things.
[02:33] Instead of that, we just started reframing it from the point of view of what would you want
[02:38] and how could you use us and what is it in it for you.
[02:42] And we started connecting all our marketing messages along with the onboarding.
[02:46] So even going out market and thinking where did you actually find us?
[02:50] How did you know about us?
[02:52] It's a reasonably large brand.
[02:53] Why have you not already downloaded us and used us?
[02:56] Have you used us and rejected us in the past?
[02:58] So kind of building that entire mental model and looking at a user from the point of view,
[03:05] let's assume that you have heard about us 20 times and what was that exact situation
[03:11] that brought you to download this app.
[03:13] So right from the entire journey of you hearing us, what was it trigger
[03:18] and what was the marketing message and what was the promotion that you were running
[03:21] and how do we continue that journey on your onboarding from your splash
[03:25] that 200 rupees off of X rupees.
[03:28] If you buy from us, continue that entire journey in the language that they understand
[03:33] and with the user experience that is continuation from the marketing to product.
[03:38] Other thing that we started focusing on a lot more and it instantly started showing us results.
[03:43] But while I'm talking about like just a very simple example and everybody should be doing it,
[03:47] that is true even for when you have a particular app which has multiple products
[03:53] and many product lines.
[03:54] The same principle that applies there and that's where I think the largest amount of Delta
[04:00] that happens that people don't know really why are we not able to cross pollinate
[04:04] or cross sell and so on so forth.
[04:06] Right now I'm working with a company called Jupiter which is a financial services app
[04:11] and it's a Neobank so we care for personal finance and it has a bunch of offerings.
[04:17] Like there's a personal account or savings account, there's a credit card, there's mutual funds,
[04:22] there is investments in say gold and FB and so on so forth.
[04:27] Like it's bunch of things.
[04:28] But when people think about why are you using us only for one service and just go away.
[04:33] Actually the key is to recognize that this user has found value and they're not interested
[04:37] in all the other things that you talked about.
[04:39] So be able to empathize with that user and now thinking about like the behavioral
[04:45] science aspects in terms of how do I convert this user from one to the other.
[04:49] That I think is extremely.
