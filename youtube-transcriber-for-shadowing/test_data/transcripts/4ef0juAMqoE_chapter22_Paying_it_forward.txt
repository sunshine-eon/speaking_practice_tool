============================================================

[00:00] That is beautiful. It reminds me, you mentioned Sam Altman. There's a tweet that he put out a couple weeks ago that'll read real quick.
[00:07] Many people have reached out to offer help and advice over the past year. No one has gotten close to Brian Chesky in terms of delivering.
[00:13] He will take a midnight call at any time, put an hour's of work on any topic, answer difficult questions correctly with clarity, make any intro, etc.
[00:22] How's that feel to have seen that?
[00:25] I was, I had no idea he was going to do that. And I just want to say, like, I think Sam is obviously like a once in a generation founder.
[00:33] I think what he's done with OpenAI is extraordinary. And when he launched chat, GPT, I had known him for a real long period of time.
[00:40] And I kind of knew a sense of the journey he was about to go on. And I think that he was very deep into the technical part and the research oriented part of OpenAI.
[00:51] But it turned out there was a product, a design, a marketing, a leadership, a sales, there were all these other functional responsibilities.
[00:58] And so being able to just play a small part in giving some advice when necessary and he would take what he wanted and discard others.
[01:06] But I think Lenny, maybe this goes to another thing, which is all I tried to do with Sam was what other people did for me.
[01:14] When I started before my commentator is a person named Michael Sybel, he's in Y Combinator.
[01:19] And he used to meet with me and give me advice. And he wasn't an official advisor. He wasn't an investor. I didn't hire him or anything like that.
[01:26] He wasn't my board. And I asked him, I said, how do I pay you? And he said, well, I want you to pass a song to other founders.
[01:34] And I would meet with a lot of people in the Valley and there was this, this like incredible culture of generosity that, that we all were going to win.
[01:43] You know, if the ecosystem was healthy and the ecosystem be healthy, if we all helped one another and you kind of pay it forward.
[01:51] And so, you know, I, you know, I think that it's just one continuation of the Valley of people helping one another, learning from one another.
[02:01] And I also feel like I learned by teaching as well.
