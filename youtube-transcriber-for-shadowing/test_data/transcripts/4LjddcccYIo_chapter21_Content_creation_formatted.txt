============================================================

Okay. Another topic that you have some interesting opinions about is product content. Very close to our hearts, both my heart and your heart. Do share. 

Really, if you're going to make good content, you have to sanitize and frameworkize the thing that you're working on. Slowly, I think for a lot of people who are reading it and looking at it, their thinking starts to become, "Well, look how well I did this framework, look how well I implemented this thing." They lose touch with the point, which is creating impact. All of this content makes it really noisy and makes people think that if they just do these things, they'll get what they want. They check it off their list, and then they expect to get their promotion at the end of the day. 

But the best PMs have built up so many different frameworks that they can apply in different ways. Sometimes they throw them out and say, "Nothing I have in my toolkit makes sense for this moment." But they know what to do because they have intuition, data, and have talked to users. Content sometimes can get in the way of the impact because you're trying to apply it, thinking that the point is the framework or the one-page document you're working on when it's not. 

If you're a leader and maybe you've had the good and ill fortune of having published content, someone comes to you and says, "Well, you said in that one podcast episode that you don't believe in roadmaps. So why are you asking me for a roadmap?" Then you're the one sitting there feeling like an asshole, thinking, "Well, it's a little more complicated than that." That was a fun take I had, but I actually need to understand what we're doing because we're planning, and I need to figure out what my budget is, blah, blah, blah. 

It's funny to think about how as a leader, you put stuff out there that people will bring back to you. Your point about people consuming content online about how to do product management is important. You have to really distill it. Often, it loses the nuance because if you had all the nuance, no one would read it because it's too complicated and long. 

There’s also the fact that it has to be interesting. If it's just another "here's how to roadmap early successfully," and it's what everyone has already done, no one will read it. You always have to have a new take, and with that comes the realization that it's not always true. I just wanted people to react to this idea. 

I think all of this is helpful. In my last role, we all had your newsletter and listened to the show. People would bring up moments where we would listen to a piece of it or find an article and say, "Oh, this could help," or "What if we did it that way?" I remember a newsletter article about Figma that had some templates, like the product review template from Fig Jam. I love that one and use it all the time. 

This stuff is really useful, but you have to be smart about when you apply it. If you're a leader and there's all this content available, you have to know why you're not following the rules. People might say, "Hey, look at this newsletter post; we should be doing it this way," versus understanding that people assume these are the one way to do it or that it will innately work at your company. 

I really like your point, which may be counter to what I do, but I think it's an important nuance that I feel I should add to every newsletter: this isn't necessarily going to work at your company. Sometimes the culture is different, and this won't fit, or this isn't a complete version. As much as I try to give people everything they need to do something well, there's always a little bit missing. 

If you don't have that context, it can be demoralizing because you might think, "How am I ever going to do that thing that they get to do at this magical company?" But if you view it as, "Here are all the tools you can add to your toolkit," and you pull them out when they're useful, that's how I think about it. It's not about having one way to do it. 

I find myself rarely telling people, "Here's the way to do it." Usually, I describe how the best companies do it as much as I can and leave it to the reader to decide if it's a fit for them or if they should try to implement it. Still, there's an implication that this is the way to do research, the way to do a roadmap, or the way to purchase. 

It's interesting that you create a lot of content and have found value in being, well, let's not call you a content creator because I don't like being labeled as a creator myself. Someone once called me a product influencer, and I died a little inside. I'd love to hear about the impact you've seen from spending time creating podcasts, blog posts, and tweeting about really great stuff because a lot of people are thinking about investing in this. 

It's probably the best thing I've ever done for my career, and I'm so grateful for the people whose idea it was and who supported me, especially when that became such a part of what we were doing at that time. It's been helpful for a couple of reasons. One is just networking and access. I probably wouldn't be here today if I hadn't done that, and if a friend of a friend hadn't read the thing. It creates so many more connections. 

Access to people and networking is one of the first benefits. Also, building a personal brand is really helpful. One of the things I always wanted to do with my career is to make it so that I'm always employable. I graduated in '08, which was a hard time, and I've always had this in the back of my mind. You want to have a solid career, so I thought investing in my personal brand would help me get access to roles. 

It helps in recruiting as well when I'm trying to hire people because a lot of my job now is bringing people in. Because I've been vocal about how I like to work and who I am, many people self-select and send me a note saying they want to work with me or on a team like mine. That's huge because if my job is to hire people, then that's great. People can get a sense of who I am without needing to be on the phone with me. 

My favorite benefit outside of those things has been that it’s helped me learn more from the work I've done than I otherwise would have been able to. To make content, you have to think through what you did, summarize it, process it, and make it interesting for people. Especially if it's in a podcast medium, you talk to somebody about it, and that process means you're paying attention to what you're learning along the way. 

Often, we don't do that because we're busy working, and life is happening. I think that's what's made me a better product person faster because I spent the time thinking about what I was doing in a way that I wouldn't have if I didn't have to write something down. 

Something that comes across in your content is that you've figured out how to avoid being cringy and overly eager for followers. When a lot of people hear "build a personal brand," they think, "I don't want to." It makes me ill even saying that. I never thought of it that way, and I'm curious what advice you'd give to people who want to go down this route without feeling cringy or producing content that makes people say, "Oh my god, I can't believe this." 

The first step is going to be cringe. Your first 10, 20, or however many posts are going to be bad. I would imagine if you went back and listened to your first episode, you would cringe just because you've learned so much since then, right? 

Although randomly, the first episode ever is the most popular episode, yes, with Shreyas, which I could see why it was so popular. So you started off really strong with your first guest. 

Yes, that's right. First, get over the fact that it's going to be cringe. Like anything, you just have to get started, and it'll fade away eventually. You don't have to think about it. To be authentic, it has to be real. What came through in the show I did were my real questions that I was genuinely working on. 

We joked about how we would turn off the recording and then get the real story. I would turn off the recording and say, "Okay, we talked about this thing. Here's what's actually happening in my job today. What would you do?" Those were real questions I had, real processes I was working on, and real advice I needed at that time. That's why it was valuable; I was actively a PM. 

The way that I'm still actively in product meant that the content had to be relevant for me and wasn't just for likes and shares. There are two really important points that stood out to me. One is that your stuff is going to be terrible if you don't actually have any background or experience in the thing. You're just pretending, acting like someone who knows about this thing when you don't. 

It's incredibly important not to try to become an online creator if you haven't done the thing because people will see that you don't know what you're talking about. You'll run out of stuff to say, and it will feel like, "Okay, I did it for two months, and I have nothing more to say." 

The other piece is a quote from Einstein that has stuck with me: "Seek not to be successful, but of value." I find that framing for sharing stuff really helpful. Share things that are interesting to you and useful, not from a place of trying to build a following because people can tell if that's your motivation. 

There's also a bit of "too cool for school" mixed in here. There are definitely people who will tell you your content is cringe or make fun of you because that's what they want to do. I won't get into the psychology of that, but people will do that. I've always believed that the really interesting people out there are those who are unashamedly interested in stuff. 

They are the ones who say, "Yeah, I'm nerding out about this, and I'm sharing it because I'm interested." For better or worse, I love working in product. I love the job, even all the gross stuff you have to do. It's super interesting. You meet really cool people, you get to ship stuff, and you see it used by people to solve problems. It's a really cool job, and I've always been interested in how to do it better. 

It doesn't matter if some people think that's cringe because, like, that's cool. This is what I do all day long, so I'd like to get better at it. I think that's such a big part of it. I didn't even mention that it needs to feel really authentic, and for you, it's just about sharing stuff that you find interesting. 

The way I started writing was exactly for the two reasons you just shared. One is that I wanted to learn the thing, and writing helped me figure things out. The second is that I thought it was interesting and useful, and I assumed other people might find it useful too. 

I wonder if you found this too: you think the things you know aren't that interesting or useful to people because they're so basic for you. But people find the most basic stuff incredibly interesting. There's always more to learn about how to roadmap, prioritize, hire, or have difficult conversations during performance reviews. 

All of that is absolutely true. One of the first pieces of content I was really happy with was when I was working with somebody who was making a PowerPoint presentation. I just wrote out in my notebook, "Okay, here's how I do that." I start with an outline on paper, draw little boxes for the slides, and write out the headline for each slide. Once I have a tight outline and the literal text for each of those slides, I sketch out how I want the slides to go. Then I go into Google Docs and actually make the slides. 

It was a silly little thing, but this person sat there and said, "Holy shit, you just totally changed the way I did this. This took me 75% less time than it would have otherwise." I was like, "I made this dumb drawing; why is this a big deal?" That's when I realized that the stuff that's easy for you might be the stuff that is most interesting because it's something you're really good at that you don't even realize. 

People need to internalize that point. If there's something you're doing that you consistently find useful and that works often, that is going to be really useful for someone to hear. That could be a good place to start.
