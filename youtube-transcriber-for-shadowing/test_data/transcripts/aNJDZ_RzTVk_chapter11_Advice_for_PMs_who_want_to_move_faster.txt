============================================================

[00:00] posts, and they're just like,
[00:01] how do we prioritize velocity?
[00:03] How do we move faster?
[00:05] Look at this, this culture of velocity that Rams Scott,
[00:07] why don't we have that?
[00:07] What do we need to create this culture of velocity?
[00:10] And I worried a little bit because it creates
[00:13] this additional pressure on product managers
[00:15] that already have a really hard job
[00:17] with already a lot of pressure.
[00:19] So it was like, oh man, we're creating this new pressure
[00:21] that this one company is doing things really well
[00:23] and that everyone has to do it this way.
[00:25] So I guess my question is just what's your advice
[00:28] to product managers who are getting this push
[00:30] from leaders to move faster
[00:32] as a result of how you guys operate?
[00:34] Yeah, well, one, I'm sorry.
[00:39] It goes without saying like PMs,
[00:40] we can't do anything by ourselves.
[00:42] We're very useless, we're a forced multiplier.
[00:44] So that the one thing that I'll highlight is like
[00:46] behind Rams velocity is a lot less like the culture
[00:50] that I try to amplify,
[00:53] but a lot more the quality of the engineering
[00:55] and design talent candidly.
[00:58] And so I'm just standing really on their shoulders here.
[01:01] And so like advice number one is ensure that
[01:05] from the top down, there's an investment in R&D
[01:08] as a first class citizen that you're paying up market,
[01:11] that you're hiring the best,
[01:12] that you're focusing on your engineering and tech brand,
[01:16] that you're bringing people who want to work there
[01:19] because they want to be empowered
[01:20] and then you have a culture of empowerment.
[01:21] And what that means is, and it's hard to get right,
[01:24] what that means is the CEO has less say
[01:28] in the product that is built
[01:31] and the engineers have a lot more say into it.
[01:33] And so it's something that I've seen done
[01:36] really, really well at Ramp
[01:38] where the CEO sets the vision,
[01:40] but is much less opinionated about the specific sequence
[01:44] by which we get there
[01:46] and trusts a tech organization
[01:48] that is rapidly empowered.
[01:50] The second thing that like, I would say is
[01:54] the biggest waste of time is meetings and status updates.
[01:59] And I think that oftentimes CEOs would say
[02:01] or leaders would say,
[02:03] hey, we've got an increase of velocity.
[02:04] Therefore, let's just add these status meetings
[02:06] and let's add all this process
[02:08] and all these documents
[02:09] and all these ways to hold teams accountable.
[02:11] And that's just a huge way to demotivate people.
[02:15] And so I've never had a status meeting.
[02:18] I've never scheduled a status meeting.
[02:20] Statuses are done async.
[02:22] They are done in the systems by which they operate
[02:25] and largely they should be in real time.
[02:27] And meetings should be all about collaboration,
[02:32] ideation, decision-making, et cetera.
[02:34] So just look at your calendar
[02:36] and just kill as many things as possible
[02:38] and kill just an important process.
[02:41] And the last thing that I would say is oftentimes,
[02:44] leaders say, I want to move super, super fast,
[02:47] but they'll say, I want everything under the sun.
[02:48] I want this and that and that.
[02:50] An example of that at Ramp is always like the debate
[02:52] between adding more products to one segment
[02:55] or going to a different segment, right?
[02:57] SME versus in market versus enterprise.
[03:00] And you ask the CEO, hey, which one should we do?
[03:04] And they would say all of it
[03:06] because they think that the more goals you have,
[03:09] the faster you'll be able to execute.
[03:11] And I think there's just a limitation to that.
[03:13] So the thing I would amplify is be very clear
[03:16] with the trade-offs that you need to make
[03:19] and present those trade-offs back to your leadership team.
[03:21] So here's what we're doing
[03:22] and here's what we're not doing in why
[03:24] and which one would you pick?
[03:25] Give them a menu of items
[03:27] and you'll see that you're able to execute
[03:29] much, much faster on four things
[03:31] rather than eight at the same time.
[03:33] That's your job.
[03:34] Your job is to basically communicate those trade-offs
[03:37] that oftentimes are not well communicated to executives
[03:40] out of fear of looking like you're pushing back.
[03:44] You're actually not pushing back
[03:45] you're increasing velocity.
[03:47] What I'm hearing from kind of a meta point
[03:49] you're making is use that ask as leverage
[03:51] to change the way things are operating.
[03:53] Is that right?
[03:54] 100%.
[03:55] You can't ask for velocity and not have empowerment
[03:59] and not trust and not eliminate process
[04:03] and not increase the focus.
[04:04] And that requires some serious trade-offs
[04:06] that oftentimes leaders,
[04:08] especially those coming from more traditional industries
[04:11] are not comfortable with.
[04:12] And it was the biggest breath of fresh air
[04:15] when I joined Ramp was how committed the team was.
[04:18] The last thing I'll say is
[04:19] there's nothing more motivating than like a leader
[04:23] just commenting like this is awesome
[04:25] on a random project channel
[04:27] at a random design crit.
[04:30] I know that our founders are just like reading the projects
[04:33] that they actually care a lot about
[04:35] and the engineers know that.
[04:37] And so there's just a general like excitement
[04:40] on just building great cool shit.
[04:43] And engineers just feel that
[04:44] and they're also like highly motivated by that.
[04:47] So that's another piece of advice
[04:50] is just like being able to stay plugged in
[04:53] to give engineers the opportunity to present
[04:55] to those leaders, present in the all hands.
[04:58] That's also a great way to amplify the culture.
[05:02] It's a good segue to this idea of burnout.
[05:05] Hearing a team operate incredibly fast
[05:08] and velocity, velocity, velocity
[05:10] makes you think about are people burning out?
[05:13] I think.
