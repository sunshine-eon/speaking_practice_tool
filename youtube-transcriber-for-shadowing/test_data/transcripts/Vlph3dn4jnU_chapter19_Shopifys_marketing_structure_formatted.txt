============================================================

Let me touch on a couple more things before I let you go. One is marketing. So we talked about sales and marketing. You guys don't have a CMO. There's no Shopify CMO. Instead, you embed marketing leads within the organization for folks that are trying to grapple with that. Should we hire a CMO? Should we do something else? What have you learned about maybe the benefits and also maybe some downsides of approaching it the way you guys have approached it?

The benefit is that there's growth marketing who sits in growth, revenue marketing who sits over closer to sales, and a brand team under Harley who does amazing work, our president. There's marketing embedded in core, and PMMs sit with product managers there. There's shop marketing on the consumer side. Marketing is truly everywhere in the organization. I think the benefit of it is that it's closest to the primary goals that those marketers are trying to achieve. They sit with growth so we can focus on that self-service motion. Harley is an amazing communicator, so brand sits with him, allowing him to have a lot of influence over that.

This structure allows us to move faster with less coordination. I think it only works because Toby and Harley have such amazing intuition on what the brand is and needs to be. Some of what the CMO does, like creating the cohesive story of Shopify, is kind of held in their heads, and they have the pen on that. This allows that piece of the CMO's job to not be as important at Shopify, but the other pieces are obviously critical. They can now be closer to the action in where they’re going to drive the most impact.

The downside is that things are sometimes very messy. This is another example where the founder's background, interests, and skills can significantly impact the way the work is structured and who you hire or don't hire.
