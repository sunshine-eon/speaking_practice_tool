Awesome. Okay. I want to ask two more questions before we get to our very exciting lightning round. And they're both skills that little birdies have told me you're very good at. One is that you are very intentional and thoughtful about staying close to individual teams and individuals within the company, even though you're higher and higher in the org. I'm curious how you do that, how you actually practice this skill of staying really close to teams kind of at the bottom of the ladder and individuals that are working on the ground, basically.

A lot of it is how I spend my time and fighting to preserve opportunities to connect with people. So examples would be, I still have bi-weekly office hours; people sign up for slots. I get that it can feel a little like speed dating for 20-minute slots, but I get to meet a whole bunch of people and hear about their work and what's top of mind. People book them out many months ahead, and it's just an opportunity to stay in touch.

I also do ask me anything sessions with teams of different sizes, depending on how intimate we want it to feel. But truly, anything is fair game as a way to get to know me as a person, for me to hear questions, and to try to be candid about what I can answer and can't answer. Those things have helped me maintain connection, but both of those examples are about making the time for it. 

What I have found as my role has changed is that it just wouldn't happen if I didn't make it a priority. Through those types of sessions, I do think I become, or I hope to become, more approachable. People know they can send me a Slack message or an email. Like I mentioned earlier, I'm going to respond to you as quickly as I can because I want to hold myself to that bar. That builds a flow of communication between me and the team that I really value. 

I don't think I would want to do my job if I didn't have those points of connection. So that helps too. And you also send my emails to everyone after every leadership meeting, so they're like, "Oh yeah, Elizabeth." Yeah, they hear from me.
