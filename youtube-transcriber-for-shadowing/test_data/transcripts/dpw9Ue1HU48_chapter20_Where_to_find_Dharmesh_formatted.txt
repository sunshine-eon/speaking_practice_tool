============================================================

That is really beautiful. Darmesh, you are wonderful. Thank you so much for doing this. This has been a lot of fun. I'm glad we were able to put this together.

Same. We covered so much ground. We got through everything that I was hoping to get through and more. 

Working folks finding online if they want to follow what you're up to and maybe reach out if they have questions, and then how can listeners be useful to you? 

Sure. I'm Darmesh, D-H-A-R-M-E-S-H everywhere. Not only findable, I'm unavoidable on the Internet, as it turns out. Follow me on social media and tell me where I'm being an idiot when I can learn. Tell me your favorite ideas. Leave a YouTube comment and tell me which Lenny episodes were your favorite so I can go back because I've been binge-watching anyway. I'd love to know.

And then speaking of that, I know you have websites of your content. You have your YouTube channel. Working folks find those things. 

Yeah, if you just go to Darmesh.com, I'll have links to the other places. And probably most often on LinkedIn, as it turns out, which is a whole topic for a whole other day. But yeah, awesome.

All right, I'll let you go. Darmesh, thank you so much for being here. Thank you. Bye, everyone.
