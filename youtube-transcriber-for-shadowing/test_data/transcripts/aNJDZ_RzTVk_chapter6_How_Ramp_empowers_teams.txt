[00:00] teams and give them a lot of control over how they operate and what they build and how
[00:03] they set goals and things like that versus micromanaging them. If they give this concept
[00:08] of context over control. I'm curious how you actually operationalize that. A lot of people
[00:14] love the idea of empowering their teams. And then they do that. And then the team,
[00:18] they just do, they do the wrong thing or they take too long or they set the wrong
[00:21] goals. So how do you actually make that work and create empowerment within your
[00:25] teams?
[00:26] Yeah, it was it was one of the biggest cultural differences, I think in ramp
[00:29] versus other companies that were as a part of where, you know, my boss, the CTO
[00:33] cream was extremely hands off in terms of of the actual pride decisions because we
[00:39] were extremely aligned on the goals themselves. And so that's that's where
[00:43] you really just start alignment is what is the goal that you're going after?
[00:48] What is the hypothesis that you have to reach that goal? What is the data
[00:51] by which you're coming up with that hypothesis? And then what is the
[00:55] potential solution to test that hypothesis? And oftentimes, you know, more junior
[01:00] leaders, and I was certainly in that camp earlier on, kept focusing on the
[01:04] solutions and debating the right solution. When in fact, you should really
[01:08] be debating upstream of that, you should be debating the interpretation of
[01:12] data, you should be interpreting, debating the, the, the hypotheses and
[01:16] the different ideas that you have there as to what's really going on or
[01:20] you should be debating the goals themselves. And so whenever things went
[01:24] wrong at ramp, it was when I was being prescriptive with regards to the
[01:27] solution without actually explaining and aligning upstream on the goal, the
[01:31] hypothesis and the data. And if you do that, you realize that the solutions
[01:36] actually can come much better from teams that are much closer to the
[01:40] ground. I think that's the biggest goal that I have now in my role is
[01:44] to continue giving context so that teams focus on the right goals, come
[01:48] up with the right hypotheses and focus on the right data points. And
[01:52] I spend most of my time just repeating myself, most of my time just
[01:55] sharing the context that I think they might be missing, especially
[01:58] given that I'm in certain meetings or certain groups and certain forms
[02:02] that they're not a part of and my responsibilities to represent them
[02:05] and then share back the context for them to do better, make better
[02:08] decisions over time.
[02:10] That touches on a phrase that's come up a couple of times on this
[02:13] podcast that a leader's job, you're essentially the repeater in chief
[02:17] reminding people of strategy, vision, think
