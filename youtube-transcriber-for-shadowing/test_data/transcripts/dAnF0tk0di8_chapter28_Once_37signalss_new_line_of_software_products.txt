============================================================

[00:00] Final question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. Let's talk about once. This is a new
[00:05] Product slash umbrella products you're developing. You just talk about the thinking here
[00:09] And then I think you guys are announcing the actual first product within this umbrella. Yeah
[00:13] So the idea behind once is David and I kind of
[00:16] Feel like we're probably a bit early here
[00:19] But we feel like there's going to be a bit of a turn back towards the way things
[00:22] were pendulum's always swing and
[00:25] For the last decade or so sass has been pretty much the only way to run business software
[00:31] They basically you rent it. There's really not a lot of alternatives like you rent software
[00:35] And we think that there's subscription fatigue and also some benefits to that for sure
[00:41] But there's also a lot of downsides just to subscription software
[00:45] You keep paying the same amount every month for the thing that you had last month
[00:49] It's not like a magazine or like every month you get literally a new issue
[00:54] So that's like new I'm paying for new weekly or monthly. Okay, that makes sense
[00:58] I mean, I know there's new stuff that comes out in software products
[01:01] But let's face it like the core of the thing that you're using
[01:05] 90% of the time is the thing you've been paying for for four years now
[01:09] Every month that just seems like meh
[01:11] so
[01:12] We were gonna launch this thing called once which is essentially a brand and umbrella a line a product line of
[01:18] Nonsass products of products not services things people will download software business software products
[01:23] People will download pay for once
[01:27] And then install on their own server or like a shared server or the in the cloud their own cloud or whatever
[01:34] But they'll run it they'll manage it
[01:36] They'll pay for it once and there's no subscription fees no recurring fees
[01:39] They get updates they get soft the support and some of that stuff, but that's it
[01:43] And so we're gonna launch the first one shortly here
[01:46] And then we plan on doing hopefully maybe three more next year and the beauty of these things is that what we're
[01:51] Basically doing is we're going out in the market and looking at it although we've already kind of know it
[01:55] We've been in this world, but we're saying like what are the commodities out there?
[01:59] there are a lot of commodities in business software and there's like
[02:02] 50 alternatives and they're kind of all sort of the same yet
[02:06] They're all still charging luxury prices in my opinion if you're paying
[02:11] Tens or hundreds of dollars a month or in some cases thousands of dollars a month month after month after month after month after month for
[02:17] When there's hundreds of alternatives and there's no price differentiation really between them
[02:22] That's an opportunity in every other industry, you know, there's there's generic peanut butter. There's there's generic pencils
[02:28] There's like all generic everything in a sense
[02:30] So we're up we're out there looking for commodities that are still charging luxury prices that we can create really beautifully tight simple
[02:37] Essential generics of very high quality that don't do everything that the other products do but get the core of it
[02:44] Right the 8020 we kind of get that right at a highly degree of quality and we can build these in typically three months each with two people and
[02:53] The the maintenance cost is zero to us essentially
[02:56] It's there's no marginal costs here because we make the software and we sell it and we don't have to maintain it in terms of
[03:00] Hosting and the whole thing which is what the expensive part of sass is so anyway
[03:04] That's the idea behind behind once and we again don't know what the market's going to think
[03:09] I have no idea, but we're really excited about trying this and seeing what happens
