[00:00] fighting for it.
[00:01] Someone's trying to think about, okay, I want to get it become better as a PM and I'm
[00:04] going to try to start simplifying.
[00:06] What are examples of simplifying?
[00:09] Is it reduce your email length?
[00:12] Is it one pager focus?
[00:14] What are these buckets of things?
[00:16] And then also if there's an example of something you've simplified that comes to mind.
[00:19] On what to simplify and more specifics, I would say anything can be simplified
[00:25] and shortened, maybe another way to say short shorten it.
[00:28] Definitely emails.
[00:30] I read them, sometimes don't love them, make them short, put the Minto principle is something
[00:36] that I would recommend everyone do, which is put the headline, the full conclusion first
[00:41] and then you're supporting argument second.
[00:42] I have a newsletter post about that exact concept that people, that we'll link in the
[00:47] show notes, that gives you exactly how to use the Minto pyramid principle.
[00:50] Yes, everyone should do that.
[00:52] A lot of new PMs fall into the trap of thinking that they should have some sort
[00:56] of buildup.
[00:57] Don't do that.
[00:58] Just tell me whatever the thing is.
[01:00] Thank you.
[01:01] Doing things like that, things like you said, limiting your strategy docs, your conclusions,
[01:07] your next steps to three things maximum.
[01:10] I would generally say a rule of thumb would be pretty much every doc you write, you can
[01:15] delete the first two paragraphs that you've written, you don't need them.
[01:19] My dad, again, to go back to my dad, he, when I would write in the soundscroll
[01:23] but I promise it wasn't, when I would write a paper for school, he would just
[01:27] and this is bad, we didn't really have computers, whatever, he would just take away
[01:30] the first page and he'd be like, just start, just start here.
[01:33] Everything he would go, everything on the first page is crap, don't use it.
[01:37] And he wouldn't even read it, which would drive me crazy.
[01:41] He would just, it's crap, I don't care about that.
[01:45] So I would do that.
