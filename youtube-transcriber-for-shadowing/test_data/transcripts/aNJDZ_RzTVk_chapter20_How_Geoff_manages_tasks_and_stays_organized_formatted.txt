I'm not allowed to put that into meeting calendar invites anymore, but that actually worked really well. Nobody really booked meetings in that slot. I didn't know Zoom had a slot feature that this community had. It was a Google calendar invite, and I also worked usually at least one day a weekend. I found that to be really effective. I know a lot of people don't want to be doing that, but I found it really important to have great success.

One other question along these lines is about optimizing for processing and getting stuff done during deep work time. Do you have any other best practices for staying organized and on top of things, knowing that there's just stuff coming at you all day, every day? If you're a manager and, like me, you're in back-to-back meetings from 10 to 6, it's very easy to feel completely overwhelmed by the sheer amount of tasks you need to handle.

Over time, I've invested in a robust and fairly simple task management process. At the end of every meeting, I write down the tasks that I owe and the tasks that someone else owes. I make sure to write them down as clearly as possible—not in vague terms, but with specific details about what needs to be done and by when. I don't spend time just grooming; instead, at the end of the day, I use notes to create a comprehensive list of everything I need to accomplish, as well as what others need to do for me.

I spend time grooming, which involves grouping tasks into logical chunks—differentiating between tactical and strategic tasks, as well as important and less important ones. I also keep track of what others owe me and send them reminders on Slack about their deadlines. This helps keep things out of sight and out of mind until they're due.

The high-level theme is that I try to create or free up headspace for processing rather than relying on memory. I spend very little time memorizing anything and write everything down. While it can be challenging to remember specific dates or details, I have a system that allows me to pull up information quickly. In the Google space, for instance, you can search documents very efficiently. So, I focus on processing, being extremely good at task management, and grouping tasks effectively.

The next day, I align my calendar with the goals I've set for myself the day before, grouping tactical tasks together and allowing space for more strategic deep thinking. I feel like you and I are very aligned on a lot of things. This is exactly how I approach tasks. Have you read "Getting Things Done" by David Allen?

I don't read a lot of nonfiction, actually.

What you're describing aligns very well with this approach to processing and taking on to-dos. It's kind of what I built my own approach on, and it seems to have naturally emerged from your experience. I love it. Let's move on to discussing your team and hiring. There will be a grab-bag set of questions. What does your current PM team look like, either in terms of numbers or ratios?
