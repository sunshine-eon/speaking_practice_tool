============================================================

[00:00] parallels. I know you also have a lot of interesting ways of
[00:03] thinking about coming up with roadmap ideas and ideating and
[00:07] building a roadmap backlog. So you already talked about this
[00:09] idea of going in very divergent directions and seeing if that
[00:12] leads anywhere. There's a couple more I someone shared. One is
[00:16] you have this idea of show don't tell what is does that
[00:21] actually show don't tell is is an idea which is an extension
[00:23] of what we're talking about is from working backwards. And
[00:27] yeah, when we're talking about working backwards, one is a PR
[00:30] FAQ, which is like a written documentation of what we're
[00:32] trying to achieve. Show don't tell is essentially a way in which
[00:36] the product manager starts ideating with the entire
[00:40] experience. And they actually create all the collateral
[00:44] collateral together of a user you need to begin with if
[00:47] you're working on a single player product, which is a
[00:49] single user product. And then you actually start bringing
[00:54] together your marketers and others in terms of what is
[00:58] literally the first screen. And how is my user getting here?
[01:03] And it's not as simple as the imagine somebody who will be
[01:06] doing this and reaching here. We try to recreate an exact
[01:09] situation. There's a concept of person not personas. So when
[01:13] we talk about personas, but we try to go to all right, no,
[01:17] don't think about a generic user. Let's say Lenny, 30 years
[01:20] old, doing ABCD things earning this much, etc, etc. His
[01:24] relationship with this category of food delivery is X. These
[01:27] are the things that he has done in the last month. In the last
[01:30] three days, they were the needs as aspirations, fears,
[01:33] frustrations, etc, etc. Okay, it's 11 o'clock. What's
[01:36] happened? Why is this user open? Or what triggered this
[01:39] particular app? And then what happened? So you literally
[01:42] start from there. And I think 50% of my product reviews
[01:46] are are on that part. And then when we say key, all
[01:49] right, then this app got open, do we have the right
[01:52] kind of way forwards for Lenny to actually achieve what he
[01:56] came here for? Literally, each pixel and each copy and each
[01:59] word is is going to be in service of that part. So that's
[02:03] kind of showing the entire journey rather than just
[02:05] saying and assuming. So that is something that I found
[02:09] really powerful with respect to even designing products or
[02:11] even thinking about why we're building something. What it
[02:15] also helps is when we are building complex products,
[02:18] especially in marketplaces, because once you're building
[02:20] this for the user, simultaneously, something is
[02:23] happening on the other part. If it is simultaneously, if it's
[02:26] a real time marketplace or something like that. So you're
[02:28] building something for the user and saying, all right, this
[02:31] guy ordered. Now there's a 30 minutes time when a delivery
[02:35] executors will will will come to come to the user with
[02:38] food. What is happening? What's the emotional state of
[02:41] the user? And let's plot out the 30 minutes time and
[02:43] let's create like various scenarios. He's like, Hey,
[02:46] maybe he went to the restaurant and the food
[02:48] is delayed or the dude on a bike, his bike got punctured,
[02:52] etc. What is a consumer thinking at this time? So you show
[02:55] all of those things in real time, and that cuts out a
[02:59] whole bunch of of, you know, random ways in which the
[03:02] product could have looked like if you're creating even a
[03:04] chatbot. So just having that showcase of all journeys
[03:09] coming together helps a lot in building your products
[03:12] in the lightweight.
