Fascinating. One more tidbit that I've heard about how you all think about this is metrics. You mentioned before we started recording that a lot of the company doesn't actually have metrics that drive what they build, especially within the core business, which I think will surprise a lot of people. Most people believe that every team needs a metric and a KPI to measure progress and determine if they're doing well. 

Talk about just how that works, considering that most of the company doesn't have a metric. It's funny; we've run against KPIs or basically banned OKRs and all that. In growth, we have the metrics, but they take a different form. In core, it truly is about whether we have conviction that this is the right technical foundation to build the future of commerce. That conviction is built through looking at data. It’s not that teams aren't looking at data and using it as a piece of their puzzle, but it's not the overriding factor. When we go to ship a feature in core, it's not like a team is held accountable for a specific metric over six months. It's much more about whether we shipped the right thing, and we evaluate that through a variety of lenses. 

Some of that could be data, qualitative insights, or just our own product sense of what's good or not. The upside of this approach is that we tend to ship things in core that are incredibly port-facing, and we take more risks. However, acknowledging some of the downsides, conversations can become extremely subjective about what the right thing to do is. This requires a good way of having discussions, with openness from all leaders and teams to debate those things. It does result in some squishiness, which has its pros and cons; the kind of taste is what drives a lot of what we're shipping in core.

I'm glad you're touching on that. I was going to say, everyone would love this idea of just building things that we think are awesome, believing it's going to be great. But then you build a whole organization with teams and people creating stuff. How does one know if they're building things that are good and helpful versus not? You're pointing out that there are pros and cons to that. The pros are that we're not optimizing for short-term wins or driving some four-metric. The con is that you might ship things that involve a lot of subjectivity, and people may not agree, leading to a lot of squishy stuff.

Totally. Glenn, who's the head of core product, is impressive in that he and the core team go incredibly deep into every single release that is shipped. This provides a central eye on the quality and how everything fits together. I think this helps ensure there's a consistent bar for taste. Glenn, along with a few others like Toby, can enforce that. It creates a subjective environment, but it's objective in the sense that a small number of people really hold what that bar is and needs to be. If it were just subjective—if we were to ship whatever we wanted without a few people holding that quality and taste bar—that's where things could go really wrong.
