So maybe just to dig into this again, because it's so interesting. Basically, product teams ship stuff, they run an experiment, they see impact, say it's a 5% lift on something. Ha-ha-huzzah! You did it, great work, performance review, your exceeds, you're doing great, this team's killing it. And then a year later, you realize, oh, that didn't last. How often do you find like a team that is shipping wins, looks back, and ends up seeing like, oh, that wasn't actually as successful as it seemed? I know you said like, maybe it's like a third of the time. The 30%. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So it's still like roughly, yeah. And it's great learning. And that's what we take it as like, wow, okay, now we really uncovered something. It's like such a successful discovery. Wow. Okay. We thought this thing, but now we learned it actually wasn't as true as we thought. Cool. What can we take from that and be smarter next time? So we don't just double down on the wrong things.

It's so interesting. And again, you mentioned most of the reason this is the case when something doesn't show lift down the road is it's pulling forward success that would have been seen later on its own if you had not even shipped this thing. Correct. Awesome. Is there an example by any chance that comes to mind of something like that? That's just like, wow, that was a big win. And then like, oh, I see, we just pulled forward some revenue from the future? 

Yeah. So I think one good example is something around payment failure notifications. One of the things that a lot of teams have or see is what's called dunning effects, where somebody might have a payment not go through, like a credit card that doesn't go through. So we did a bunch of experimentation around, hey, how can we alert people that their credit card has failed, their payment attempt failed? And that's a typical kind of growth win that usually produces a lot of short-term impact. And that's what we saw here. We were doing much better alerting, reminding people, sending them a million emails about it. Cool. We got some pretty major lift. 

You look back six, 12 months, and there was really no long-term lift. And why is that? Because there's really a little bit of a selection bias there; the people who are letting that payment fail probably weren't actually that dedicated to this entrepreneurship craft. They may have updated their credit card, but they still really weren't in it. And so that was a good example of a bunch of this stuff around kind of payments, even, quote, preventing churn when you look at it six, 12, or 18 months on a GMV metric, not a lot of lift over that long-term horizon.

I love this example. Like, I could see so many people having run experiments like this and like, oh, we found such a huge win, whoo-hoo. This seems killing. It was a great idea. Of course, this makes sense, duh. And then it turns out it's nothing long-term. Yeah, which is great because we were spending, you know, we were going to spend a lot of time kind of, okay, what else can we do here? It's like, no, actually, bigger fish to fry in a lot of other areas. So just, it helps the team feel really good that their work is really the things that were good.

You know, another one that went the other way, which is really interesting, was in our online store. This might be, if you shopify, you have sections and blocks that come pre-configured. And so we tested, okay, if we give you a pre-configured block of like, you should have an image up top, then a text banner, and then a collage with your products, that should help folks understand what to do when they're building the online store. It actually had no lift in people converting to a paying merchant. 

However, when we looked longer-term on that six months later, it had a pretty massive impact on the number of people who were selling and producing GMV. And why is that? Because it didn't likely really influence anyone to buy Shopify or pay for Shopify, but the people who used it created better stores that were higher converting. And so they got early sales, they actually converted one of their visitors, and they got momentum, and they stuck with entrepreneurship a little bit longer. 

And we saw that in that opposite way. And so this is an example of that neutral. So we tend to ship neutral. It's like, it could be positive. And so let's like, let it go if we have good intuition about it, and it will turn. So we've seen a bunch of these things go in very different directions.
