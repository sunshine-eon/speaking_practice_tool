============================================================

[00:00] Fascinating.
[00:01] One more tidbit that I've heard
[00:04] about how you all think about this is metrics.
[00:07] And you mentioned before we started recording
[00:09] that a lot of the company doesn't actually have metrics
[00:12] that drive what they build,
[00:13] especially within the core business,
[00:15] which I think which surprise a lot of people.
[00:17] Most people are like, every team needs a metric
[00:19] and a KPI and this is how we measure progress.
[00:21] And this is how we know if they're doing well.
[00:23] Talk about just how that works,
[00:24] how companies, most of the company
[00:25] doesn't have a metric.
[00:26] Yeah, it's funny, we've ran it against KPIs
[00:29] or basically banned as an OKRs or banned and all that.
[00:32] So it's certainly like in growth,
[00:36] we have the metrics, but they take a different form.
[00:39] And then in core, it truly is do we have conviction
[00:46] that this is the right technical foundation
[00:49] to build the future of commerce?
[00:50] And that is built through certainly looking at data.
[00:53] So it's not that teams are not looking at data
[00:55] and using it as a piece of their puzzle,
[00:58] but it's not the overriding.
[01:00] And when we go to ship a feature in core,
[01:02] it's not like a team is held accountable
[01:04] for this metric over this six months.
[01:08] It's much more, did we ship the right thing?
[01:10] And we're gonna kind of get at that
[01:12] through a variety of lenses.
[01:14] Could be some of that could be data,
[01:15] qualitative, just our own kind of product sense
[01:19] of what's good or not.
[01:20] And so that, I think the upside of that
[01:24] is I think we tend to ship things in core
[01:28] and that are incredibly
[01:32] port facing and if we take more risks.
[01:34] I think that to acknowledge some of the downside of it though
[01:37] is sometimes conversations get extremely subjective
[01:41] about what is the right thing to do.
[01:42] And so that requires kind of a,
[01:46] the right way of having kind of good discussions,
[01:50] kind of openness from all leaders
[01:51] and from teams to debate those things.
[01:53] But it does result in some squishiness,
[01:56] which again, as is pros and cons,
[01:57] the kind of taste is kind of what drives a lot
[01:59] of what we're shipping in core.
[02:01] Yeah, I'm glad you're touching that.
[02:03] I was gonna say, okay, everyone would love this idea
[02:05] of just build things that we think are awesome.
[02:07] It's gonna be great.
[02:08] But then you build a whole org with teams
[02:10] and people building stuff.
[02:11] How does one know if they're building things
[02:14] that are good and helping versus not?
[02:17] And you're pointing out there are pros and cons to that.
[02:20] The pros is we're not optimizing
[02:22] for some short-term wins and driving some four metric.
[02:25] The con is you might ship stuff that,
[02:27] like there's a lot of subjectivity
[02:29] and people may not agree
[02:31] and it's a lot of kind of squishy stuff.
[02:35] Yeah, totally.
[02:36] Glenn, who's the head of core product.
[02:38] I mean, one of the things that's so impressive about
[02:40] Glenn and kind of that core team is
[02:42] they go incredibly deep into every single release
[02:48] that it shipped.
[02:49] And so you do have a central kind of eye on
[02:53] the quality and how it all fits together.
[02:56] And so that I think helps make sure
[02:59] there's a consistent kind of bar for taste.
[03:02] That's Glenn, a bunch of folks, Toby obviously,
[03:05] that kind of can enforce that.
[03:06] So it creates, it's subjective,
[03:08] but it's objective in the sense that it's kind of
[03:10] a small number of people who really hold
[03:12] what that bar is and needs to be.
[03:15] I think if it's just subjective,
[03:17] let's just ship what we want without kind of
[03:20] a couple of people really holding that,
[03:22] that quality and that taste bar,
[03:24] that's where things go really.
