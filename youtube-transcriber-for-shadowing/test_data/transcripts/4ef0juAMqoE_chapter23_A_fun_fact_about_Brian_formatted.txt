Final question: when someone joins Airbnb, there's a very long-standing tradition of sharing a fun fact about yourself. It might be the longest-standing tradition. It's always tough on the spot, but I'm curious, Brian, if there's a fun fact that you want to share about yourself that maybe people don't already know.

Yeah, so a fun fact about me is that I actually spent most of my life as an artist. You know, when I was five years old, I remember my parents took me to the Norman Rockwell Museum, and I would sit in front of his beautiful illustrations. They're really paintings, to say they shouldn't even call them illustrations. I would try to reproduce them, and I got obsessive with art. I remember when I was maybe in elementary school, I asked Santa for poorly designed Christmas toys so I could redesign them.

When I got older, one of my friends invited me to his house. I was about eight or nine years old, and his dad was basically redoing his deck. His dad decided to design it himself, maybe with the help of an architect. We had this giant dining room table, and he had vellum paper, a T-square, a drawing triangle, and a protractor. They were really cool-looking tools, and they were basically floor plans and architectural drawings. So, I got into architectural and landscape design when I was like eight or nine, and that led to my interest in architecture.

I went to RPI as a freshman in high school to do a pre-college program. Then I got into more and more drawing and figure drawing, and I eventually got into film and animation. I also got involved in environmental design. I realized that if you buy stock in a company, you could get these cool glossy annual reports. This was around the time when the internet was just starting, and people still mailed annual reports. I got my dad to buy a few shares of Disney stock, and I received these renderings and the annual report of theme parks. I started drawing and designing theme parks and communities.

I attended a private school, actually for hockey, because I had this parallel life where I was playing ice hockey. I thought I was going to play college hockey; my dad was really into it, and I was really into it too. I had an art teacher in high school at this military school. That's another fun fact—I basically went to a military high school. Wow, I did not know that! 

At this military sports academy-oriented high school, I had the same art teacher from eighth grade to eleventh grade. That's not a good thing, by the way; I don't see this as a good thing because I was not diversifying my skills. So, I left this high school because I wanted to pursue different interests than hockey and transferred to my public high school late in my junior year. Imagine transferring to a new public high school late in your junior year.

I met my art teacher who changed my life. Her name is Miss Williams, and she saw my artwork. By the way, my mom was nervous about me becoming an artist. She used to tell me to choose a job for the love of it, but I wouldn’t get paid much. She said to choose a job that pays a lot of money. I told my mom one day I was going to be an artist, and she said, "Oh my God, you chose the only job that’s going to pay less than a social worker!" 

I think my parents were supportive of me going into art, but they were very nervous. Then Miss Williams told my mom, "Don't worry, he's going to be a famous artist one day." I wasn't going to become a famous artist, but what that did was give everyone the confidence to let me pursue art. I ended up being one of the winners of a national art competition, and I had my artwork displayed in the Rotunda Gallery. That led to me getting a scholarship at the Rhode Island School of Design, where I ended up going to RISD. 

It's kind of like MIT for design; it’s a prestigious art and design school. But when I got to RISD, I realized I was born a hundred years too late for what I wanted to do, which is to draw and paint. I felt like at that point, photography—and now AI-generated art—but certainly even back then, photography was replacing a lot of the skills that I had. That was when I was in my freshman year of college. I learned about a field called industrial design. They said industrial design is the design of everything from a toothbrush to a spaceship and everything in between.
