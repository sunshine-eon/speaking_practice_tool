============================================================

[00:00] You mentioned earlier that you don't set metrics goals and so let me take into that a little bit.
[00:05] Is that true? You don't really have a number of goals for features, for launches and things like that.
[00:10] And so let me start there and I have a follow-up question.
[00:13] Yeah, so we might have like a company level goal sometimes like for example like weekly active
[00:17] users like that's like a metric we want to increase or something but in terms of like
[00:23] specific features we don't have goals for those. And the reason is that I think like
[00:30] product like us or like a system that is used by different kinds of companies and kind of it's
[00:37] like a system made of multiple different parts and it's not like a very it's not necessarily like
[00:42] you want to optimize any specific thing about it. It's like also companies are a little bit
[00:47] different so like their usage of different features can like differ because they just operate
[00:52] slightly differently or their team size is different or the setup of the team is different
[00:56] or the culture is different. So there's like I think like for example I don't know some like
[01:02] Instagram or some of these apps it's like yeah we need to drive engagement and that's like the
[01:06] main feature like that's the main metric for every feature like we don't actually we don't have that
[01:11] like we we just think that like there should be features that help companies and sometimes
[01:16] we can look at the metrics before we start working on it like let's see what's this
[01:21] state of things are but we don't necessarily want to set like oh we need to increase the specific
[01:26] metric by by x it's more like we want to solve this problem and ideally the success what it looks
[01:33] like the problem like customers agree that the problem is solved or they they enjoy the solution
[01:37] and it's not like that the metrics went up
