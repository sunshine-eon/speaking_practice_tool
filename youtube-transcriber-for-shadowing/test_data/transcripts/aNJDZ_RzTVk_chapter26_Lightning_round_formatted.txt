============================================================

Um, so I'm, because I work a lot, I try to read things that are completely outside of work. I don't think I can get through any like fiction or non-fiction book that's often recommended. So anything that will pull on your heartstrings and try to make you more human, "When Breath Becomes Air" is a really good one that I often recommend. Amazing. Love that one.

Favorite recent movie or TV show? After watching "The Bear" a few weeks ago, I think it's a great show around leadership and how a different industry operates—the restaurant industry. My dad owned a restaurant, so I got a little bit into that. It's all about teamwork and the balance between quality and velocity of personal and professional stress. I thought that was a really good learning experience. Wow, that show makes me really think of "Ramp." It makes a lot of sense. Everything just feels crazy and fast-paced. I'm just so stressed watching that show. I haven't watched the second season yet. 

You should come to our office; it's probably very similar—just delicious food, sandwiches, and the velocity.

Favorite interview question you'd like to ask candidates? I ask, "What's the hardest thing you've ever done?" I ask that because working at Ramp is hard. I want to understand what hard means for them. I want to understand why it was hard, how they overcame that difficulty, how they worked with other people to overcome that difficulty, and how much agency they had in overcoming that. It's a really good sign around what difficulty means to them and how much work they put into overcoming it.

What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like? My partner bought me this Whoop recently, and I'm wearing it now. It gives you real-time stress signals. Oh, that's pretty helpful. I think it's a great product in terms of actual insights. It's very data-driven. It provides a daily journal of all the things you did that day and correlates what you did to your recovery score and how healthy you are for that day. It gives you insights around how certain actions you take will impact your next day's health, which is all about heart rate variability. 

That was just a great way to continue to focus on your health. I think running a team has a huge impact on your physical and mental health. You are an athlete at a high-growth startup, a small business, or a large company, and focusing on health is really important. Any tools like the Whoop to invest in that are great. 

Now that's a really good pitch for the Whoop. I have never wanted one, but now I do. 

Okay, next question. What is something relatively minor you've changed in your product development process that has had a big impact on your team's ability to execute? It's something I've changed, but more something that our head of design, Diego, has changed. Basically, having designers spend more time creating more visionary prototypes and then sharing those out in move videos has had a huge impact on how exciting the work is and how excited the team is. Providing that clarity is massive. Just using tools like Figma and Loom, and interactive prototypes that people can actually play around with, is a huge way to unlock velocity.

Final question. I've already asked you about this a couple of times, but I'm curious if there's any other productivity tip or tool that you'd recommend to listeners that you haven't mentioned yet. Turn off notifications, quit Slack when you're doing teamwork, check your emails once a day, and just literally go through them in like five minutes. Most of the time, they're useless. Check Slack only at the top of the hour. Use Slack snooze or reminders. This could be a whole other podcast where we talk about Slack channels and how to organize that. 

Just get really good at the tools you're using. I think in the first year of consulting, we just got really good at Excel and Excel shortcuts. That was a big part of our training. So train yourself and your teams on how to use their tools—how to use your calendar, how to use Slack, how to use email, whatever the tool you've designed as the right tool for you. Be dogmatic. I mean, Ramp is a tool at the end of the day, and we're helping finance teams be more efficient. So let's talk through that and do that with our own tools. 

I think we've had just enough velocity in our chat. I think we're going to hit a hundred million downloads. I think we built an A-plus team here. Jeff, thank you so much for doing this. 

Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to ask you any other questions? 

You can find me on Twitter and LinkedIn. Twitter is Jeff in Tech. 

How can they be useful? Honestly, your attention is a gift. If you're interested in joining us here at Ramp, we're obviously hiring incredible people. So if anything I shared resonates with you and you want to join the team, we're hiring across product, engineering, and design. But most importantly, be kind to yourself. I've been a huge listener to this podcast; it's an honor to be here. I know very little, but hopefully some of what I shared was meaningful to you. Keep the growth mindset, think from first principles, and keep investing in that growth. Be patient; it takes a lot of time.

What a beautiful way to end it. Jeff, thank you again so much for being here. 

Thanks a lot. This was all fun.
