============================================================

[00:00] It's easier to do that if you're the founder running the company, obviously. Is there something
[00:06] you find that you can do to help your teammates approach things that way too? Do you just trust
[00:10] their instincts also in a similar way? Yeah. I mean, you're right, by the way. It is, it's,
[00:15] it's easy for me to sit up here and say this. Like, I own the place, no one can fire me,
[00:19] like, I get it, right? I can be wrong all the time, go, my God, just told me to do this.
[00:23] And, you know, I understand. I do, I'm self-aware enough to understand that.
[00:29] But I think that by demonstrating that's how we make decisions, it gives, it creates space for
[00:36] other people to make decisions that way. And when we have conversations, you know, I'm talking with
[00:40] my team about something, I'll often go, I don't really know, it just feels like this,
[00:44] it feels this way. And they'll say, I feel this way. And I'll ask them, how do you feel?
[00:49] How do you feel? You know, what we ask people in general is like, we say, we say, what do you think?
[00:56] We don't say, what do you know? We often say, what do you think? We might say,
[01:01] what do you know? But we also say, what do you think more time? And what does that mean?
[01:06] Like, what do you think is, is like, I don't, I don't know where these thoughts come from.
[01:09] And I don't know what, what forms them. So I think it's interesting to look at the things
[01:13] we say and go, we actually do at want people to think. And, and so I'll often say, what do you
[01:19] think or what do you feel? Or how does this feel is something we talk more about at work than
[01:24] pretty much anything else, which is like, how does this screen feel? How does this flow feel?
[01:28] How does this feature feel? How does this word feel? How does this sentence feel? How does
[01:31] this paragraph feel? How does this website feel? How do these colors feel? Because human
[01:36] beings feel. And while we have a logical side to us and a rational side to us, we're primarily
[01:47] feeling creatures, even if we don't admit it, we are. And so I'm always curious about that.
[01:52] So I bring that up a lot. And I ask other people how they feel. And I think, hopefully,
[01:57] that encourages people to share that side of their opinion. And we almost never, sometimes we
[02:06] look at numbers to sort of be an input, but it's never like prove that. I'll never say like justify
[02:15] that. That's just not terminology or lingo that we ever, we ever bring up. It's not, it's not a
[02:22] way. It's how do you feel? It's not like, how certain are you? We don't, I try to tend to
[02:30] shy away from anything that's about certainty. We're not after certainty. I want to know how you
[02:36] think it feels. So anyway, I'm rambling again. But this is, I'm rambling because this is actually
[02:41] how things go. When we talk, there is a lot of this. It's not precise in a sense. It eventually
[02:49] becomes precise when it's out in the world. But the thought process is very rambling and
[02:55] very amorphous. And you kind of find your way as you go and eventually go, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[03:00] that's it. That's it. That feels right.
