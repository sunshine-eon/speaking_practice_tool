============================================================

[00:00] And also the other thing we're doing is, as you know, Lenny, we're spending a lot of money in performance marketing.
[00:05] I don't think performance marketing is a bad thing.
[00:07] I think of performance marketing as a laser.
[00:09] Actually, my co-founder, who obviously you know, well, Joe used to have this metaphor of lasers, flash bulbs and chandeliers.
[00:17] If you want to light up a room, performance marketing is a laser.
[00:21] It can light up a corner of a room.
[00:23] You don't want to use a bunch of lasers to light up an entire room.
[00:26] You should use a chandelier.
[00:28] And that's what brand marketing is.
[00:30] But if you do need a laser in, in balance, supply and demand, then performance marketing is really good.
[00:35] It literally lasers in.
[00:37] Performance marketing, though, doesn't create very good accumulating advantages because it's not an investment.
[00:43] Now, if you want to build it permanently, like booking.com, if you have a really high ROI, now you can have a performance marketing arbitrage business.
[00:52] But assuming you don't want to arbitrage business, you actually need to be investing.
[00:57] And so we think of marketing as education that we're educating people on the unique benefits.
[01:03] So a lot of companies don't do product marketing.
[01:06] They do brand marketing, which are ads about the app, or they do performance marketing, but they're never really educating people about new things they're making and shipping.
[01:14] And because no one's marketing, new things are shipping, there's no purpose to ship new things.
[01:20] Because you ship new things and people don't know about them or use them or they're not educated.
[01:24] And so you try these big new things, people don't adopt them immediately.
[01:28] So then you get more and more incremental.
