============================================================

[00:00] Okay, so let's get into the mother load of learnings from the journey of streaks
[00:03] So the first version went from XP to one lesson talk about the
[00:08] Key lessons insights and also wrong turns along the way to what we see today. Doolingo has very much, you know
[00:15] It has a strong like test it philosophy
[00:19] You know, we're willing to test a lot of different
[00:22] Well, honestly, we'd much rather test it than like debate it for you know days and days
[00:26] So we actually followed up this experiment with and this is this is a little bit later with
[00:31] Hey, what if we make it even easier to extend your streak and so we actually tested
[00:36] Hey, if you if you do one exercise
[00:39] Just one exercise in a lesson will will extend your streak
[00:42] And in a lot of like the insight was good like you look at the funnel
[00:45] Hey, there's a lot of users who are starting but not finishing lessons. They're not extending your streak
[00:49] The loss aversion doesn't kick in they don't you know come back
[00:52] So this kind of followed that train of thought what we realized when we ran this experiment is
[00:58] um, you know
[00:59] DA used moved not one bit and and what we would what we were doing by and this if we go back to like a unit of measure
[01:07] You know, we had we had dumbed down the unit of nobody thinks about I just want to come you do one question on
[01:13] Duolingo nobody thinks about that
[01:15] So we had more like a a less clear unit of measure that we were basing our streak around
[01:20] And and the users that we are capturing with our streak
[01:23] You know, you come you do one or two questions on Duolingo than you leave
[01:27] We're like the least engaged users imaginable
[01:29] And so, you know, I think that's something also to think about as you're building your streak is like
[01:32] What is the user that you're solving for so not only what is the kind of habit that you're building for?
[01:36] But like what is the level of commitment?
[01:39] That was an example where we over indexed on
[01:42] A type of user who we honestly just weren't going to keep
[01:45] Uh, that was a very easy shut down
[01:48] Shutdown decision. That's an awesome story. I just just a comment on that real quick
[01:51] Just like you went like let's just go to the extreme and make it just like streaks
[01:55] Yeah, get everyone going streaks forever. And then I love that it turned out and
[02:00] It's not bringing the users that you want and it's dumbing down the experience
[02:04] It makes me think of farmville where you have to go and like harvest your crops every whatever hour
[02:08] And just like like that lasts for a bit and then eventually people are like, what the hell am I doing with my life?
[02:13] Exactly. No, we I mean and we test every so we I was looking at numbers as well
[02:17] We we've run in the last four years over 600 experiments on the street. So every other day effective hundred
[02:25] We're running an experiment and and they range from big like this like changing how the mechanic works to like
[02:31] Let's swap a string with another string and see if that copy is better, you know for for users
[02:36] So so we're constantly testing on on everything. I do think that like
[02:40] I'd be more careful running that experiment now like at some point your streak gets big enough that
[02:46] Again, I got 9 million users on the streak. I got to be really careful. Those are our best retaining users
[02:50] You know, you got to be careful, but in the early days of the streak, I'd say like test everything
[02:55] I mean see what don't get don't get super caught up
[02:58] And it has to be like this just test a bunch of stuff and see what speaks most to users
[03:03] Because I think you know, again, you will constantly be surprised by the the insights that you get from whether you
[03:08] We we shut down about half of our experiments. So half of our big
[03:12] Of our experiments lose we still learn a ton by virtue of of running them. So super super valuable
[03:18] That's actually a good success rate. A lot of companies have only 20 percent
[03:22] Experiments be positive. What's your policy on is if it's neutral, do you ship it or do you kill it?
[03:28] It really depends if if we're adding something and it's and it's neutral
[03:33] We tend to to shut it down because it's just more cognitive load
[03:36] It's something that we're going to have to start building around a new UI element that we have to figure out how it fits into our system
[03:41] I'd say when we do ship a neutral experiment is
[03:45] Something that that we have real
[03:48] Conviction around, okay
[03:50] Yeah, maybe this was neutral, but it's going to give us a new platform to then build on top of so
[03:55] That experience might be neutral, but now we can build these da u positive experiments
[03:59] And my general take there is though in that case
[04:03] Build that in as part of your v1 so that you know, you make sure that like at least your hypothesis around
[04:09] This roadmap, you know has play, you know should probably be the case but in general
[04:15] Shutting down a neutral experiment so you don't introduce more complexity. The app is is the way we tend to go
[04:20] Makes sense. All right. What else what else have you learned along the journey?
[04:22] Well, I mean, maybe I can talk about a few different ways that we
[04:26] Structure, you know, a few different themes that I think we we we lean on
[04:30] so the first is
[04:32] Focusing on the zero to seven day
[04:35] User experience and I would say this is if you look at the kind of you know, whatever breakdown of experiments are
[04:40] we run
[04:41] Definitely more than average number of experiments on getting users to go from a zero to seven days streak
[04:47] And a lot of this is because we've looked at the data for you know
[04:51] Our retention curves and what we found is that once you get to seven days loss aversion kicks in and and you retain
[04:56] So going from a one to a two-day streak huge jump in retention two to three day streak
[05:02] Slightly less but still huge and it's up until day seven once you hit day seven it flans out
[05:06] It's not to say that like, you know, if you're a you have a 30 day streak
[05:08] You're way more attentive than day seven
[05:10] but
[05:11] Not in the order of magnitude that it is from from day one through seven
[05:15] so
[05:16] we do a ton of work to
[05:18] Get users to that point where loss aversion kicks in and then they don't want to
[05:22] They don't want to leave the app
[05:24] One of the fun ones that we did and it's honestly as much about process as it is about the feature itself was
[05:31] We have a feature called streak goal
[05:33] and it is
[05:34] Again, so much of the stuff seems so obvious in retrospect
[05:38] But you know, it was really novel at the time
[05:40] You know, we had this idea of like, hey, maybe we'll just goal users to hitting a certain streak length
[05:46] As you can imagine, this is pretty powerful
[05:49] You know user psychology and we started with the simplest version of this and this is how duolingo does a lot of our testing
[05:54] You know rather than design the big complex feature for v1
[05:59] Just do like the simplest encapsulation of what that feature can be see if it has legs
[06:04] And then just add to it iteratively over time. This is partially how we get to you know, 600 plus experiments on streaks
[06:09] They're not all big ones
[06:10] But we started and it was funny
[06:12] We actually took a learning from our modernization teams
[06:14] And one of the strings that they had the pieces of copy that they had worked really really well was
[06:19] I think it was your
[06:21] Like 5.6 times more likely to finish the course if you subscribe to plus and sort of you know
[06:27] Now it's super our subscription and it was it was a really good hook that if you if you really cared
[06:32] You'd sign up
[06:34] And so we ran a similar we had a similar thought where it's like, oh, let's just tell you how much more likely you are to
[06:40] Finish the course
[06:42] if you
[06:43] Get a 30-day streak and so we started with that and I think it was like you're seven times more likely to finish the course
[06:47] if you have a 30-day streak
[06:49] And just that message when you started your streak us telling you that was
[06:53] awesome huge win
[06:56] You know indicating an outcome and like duolingo doesn't have we don't but we have a gem economy
[07:00] But we don't actually have like, you know, it's just it's all you learning
[07:04] But being able to actually talk about it in terms of the outcomes that a user would think about
[07:08] In this case trying to finish the course
[07:10] Was a huge win. So this is where we started and we're like, ah goal setting. All right, we we should go much harder on that
[07:16] some
[07:18] And now let's just beat that kind of it
[07:20] So we followed that up with another experiment where we we tested different lengths
[07:24] So we'll test 14 days and in 50 days and we found that
[07:28] They were all good, but they they appealed to different users. And so
[07:33] We started to realize all right. Well, we probably need to be more thoughtful about who we give
[07:38] You know these different options to
[07:40] And and and so then we followed that experiment up with all right
[07:43] Let's start with 30 days and then we're going to let you opt out
[07:46] You know, we'll say no, I don't think I can hit it
[07:48] And our thinking was and then if you say no, we'll hit you with an easier goal because we just wanted to get you to
[07:53] commit to a goal
[07:55] and this was a fascinating one because
[07:58] It was a good win to give users that easier goal to try to capture capture them before they said no
[08:04] But it was almost just as big a win to add that opt-out button
[08:07] So we tested separately and i'm a huge fan of testing like way too many arms for an experiment just to like be able to isolate your hypotheses
[08:14] But but we captured, you know, just what happens if we add an opt-out button
[08:18] And adding an opt-out button when you would think like as a p.m. Oh, I'm like, you know
[08:22] Now users might not engage with my feature. That's a bad thing
[08:26] But it was a huge win to let them do that and and the learning here was that this intentionality of saying
[08:32] No, I want it previously was just to continue button
[08:35] But now it's like no, I want to hit 30 days and and and having that be an intentional decision for them
[08:41] Yes or no, even though again this had no impact none or no impact past this screen
[08:46] everything that i'm talking about now was
[08:49] Uh, you know just that screen that day and then was all thrown out
[08:54] So that optionality was was was uh, you know a huge insight
[08:58] And so because of that we built a a goal setting feature where you could choose between different goals
[09:03] Giving users that optionality was was uh, likewise a huge win. I'll say one one final learning on this
[09:10] Um, again, you talk about like friction and in good and bad friction
[09:14] We thought once we built, uh, you know a goal picker screen where you could pick between different
[09:19] streak lengths we we were like, oh well
[09:22] Let's like recommend that users do a hard, you know a harder goal
[09:25] Thinking that okay. Well harder goal is going to be better retention and and we'll pre-select the harder goal for them
[09:30] And this based on all the learnings that I just shared with you you probably imagine lost pretty significantly
[09:35] We realized that like yes, we could speed users through the screen more by virtue of picking a goal for them
[09:40] But like that act of selecting
[09:44] I think it's 30 days. I think it's 14 days was where we were getting so
