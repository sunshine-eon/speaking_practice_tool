============================================================

[00:00] You're about 13 p.m. A ramp is probably over 100 engineers.
[00:08] So I try to keep miss the one to one day to one to 15, depending on the team.
[00:13] Obviously, B2B is slightly more complex because you're dealing with pretty strong
[00:16] marketing team and pretty strong sales team and pretty demanding customers
[00:20] that you have relationships with.
[00:22] So I've seen ratios be a bit lower than the B2C space.
[00:25] But yeah, that's a little bit of a team today.
[00:27] And they're organized by those teams, by those customer pain points.
[00:32] And I have this note from before you said that you reached 100 million error
[00:36] and that's a run rate. I'm not recurring revenue at that point.
[00:38] I imagine rate with 50 people, which is incredible.
[00:43] And so just kind of on that point, how do you do so much with so few p.m.s.
[00:47] especially? Do you have anything that you figured out that ends up being really important there?
[00:51] I think that by eliminating or reducing the size of the team,
[00:56] we've forced other people in the company to think like p.m.s.
[01:00] And I think it's been a huge value add to our culture.
[01:04] You know, when I say product, that people think about like product management,
[01:07] but I actually think product is anyone that actually reports into our CTO and that's
[01:13] product engineering, product design, product managers, product data scientists.
[01:19] So making everyone feel like a p.m. is a great way to get leveraged as a p.m.
[01:23] And that means basically empowering the designer to think about the actual specs
[01:27] and priorities and scopes more than you or empower the engineer to take something that's
[01:32] fairly lightweight in terms of a spec or direction and actually think through it deeply
[01:37] and come back with some great questions that the p.m. hasn't thought through.
[01:41] So that's one thing. The second is that we invested early on in product operations,
[01:47] which was a team that also reports to me that basically focuses on the operational functions
[01:54] of product that's everything around, whether it's project management or issue management
[02:00] or release management or enablement and content, beta and customer research,
[02:06] they basically are tasked with a lot of the work that needs to get done to
[02:10] continue shipping products and scaling product development.
[02:14] And then lastly, just cutting as much of the low leverage work that p.m. often gets
[02:19] sucked into. So for example, we never write a ticket. We don't spend much time in linear,
[02:28] which is our ticket management system. We basically, our contract is the vision and the
[02:33] priority in a very high level spec and everything else is kind of pushed on the engineering teams.
[02:38] And I think that's when engineers actually are also able to move even faster because
[02:42] they can create whatever tickets they want. They can break down the work that they want.
[02:46] They are accountable for the projects that they're driving and that increases trust and moves things
[02:52] faster as well. That makes a ton of sense. Basically, you distribute the p.m. job that other
[02:59] companies put on the p.m. across other team members. So if you had to think about just
[03:04] what is the core product manager job at Ramp at this point, I imagine from what I've been
[03:09] hearing, it's strategy, vision, aligning the team. What else kind of plays into that just
[03:14] bullet point-wise?
