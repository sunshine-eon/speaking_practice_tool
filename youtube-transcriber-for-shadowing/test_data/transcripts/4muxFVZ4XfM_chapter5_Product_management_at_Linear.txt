============================================================

[00:00] All right. Well, I got to follow this thread.
[00:02] There's a couple of questions I'm going to ask.
[00:03] So you have one product manager,
[00:05] would you call him the head of product?
[00:07] Yeah. Non-U, who is the head of product.
[00:11] Awesome. So what made you decide to hire him and even have any PMs?
[00:15] We started to see that, okay,
[00:17] we have enough features and areas of the product,
[00:23] and also the team is bigger,
[00:25] that it's hard to keep aligned on all of these things,
[00:29] or even keep track of things.
[00:31] Initially, we actually hired Non as a contractor to help us with
[00:34] this insights data tool.
[00:36] So we have this data tool feature built in linear,
[00:40] so you can get data on what's happening in the workspace.
[00:44] For us, founders, we realized,
[00:46] none of us are like, we are not super experienced in data tools,
[00:51] so we need someone to help out,
[00:52] then luckily Non was like,
[00:54] we knew him and he actually worked at Mode,
[00:56] which is a data tool.
[00:58] And so we initially hired him,
[01:00] can you help us figure out what exactly should this data tool
[01:04] and how should it work?
[01:05] Because I think there's different ways of doing that,
[01:07] and I think always the easiest way is let's us copy
[01:10] what some other company is doing,
[01:12] but we didn't want to do that,
[01:13] so we wanted to figure out what is actually useful way
[01:17] to use this data or get this data.
[01:20] So he helped us with that,
[01:21] and then we saw this could be useful in other larger areas
[01:26] or overall with the whole product,
[01:28] we might have this kind of questions,
[01:30] what should we exactly be thinking around here,
[01:32] why and how would we define this direction
[01:36] and then help the teams to also align on it?
[01:39] So to us, it's more like he's kind of like the,
[01:43] figures out the direction of the product
[01:45] and steers some of the efforts
[01:49] and not like he's there in every meeting
[01:52] and making every decision or writing every spec or something.
