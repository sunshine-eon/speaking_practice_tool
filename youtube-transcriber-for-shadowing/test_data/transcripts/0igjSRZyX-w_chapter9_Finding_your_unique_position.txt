============================================================

[00:00] get that right, you need to spend all the time, you need to get that right. This reminds me of
[00:04] something else that when your early investors shared with me, Bill Trenchard from First
[00:07] Round Capital, he talked about how speed was the thing that you just dialed up as a lever to like
[00:13] 11. That's where you just, we will make this the focus, speed, speed, speed. And I think the,
[00:19] maybe the lesson there is just you pick the thing that you think will most differentiate you,
[00:24] make you significantly better than what's out there. So I guess just thoughts and just
[00:29] how to decide, how you decided speed was the thing you were going to obsess with
[00:33] and just, I don't know, advice for folks that are trying to decide where to dial up things to 11.
[00:37] Bill is right and I agree with him. You have to pick something. Knowing what to pick is the trick.
[00:44] And in the early days of Superhuman, I've read a book on positioning that really influenced my
[00:49] thinking. And it is, I believe, called positioning the battle for your mind. And it struck me how
[00:56] the most well-known brands have stood for one clear thing, like they have a clear position.
[01:02] And so in order for Superhuman to be memorable, I believed that we needed to occupy a clear position
[01:07] that was unique and which was available and which reinforced our product strategy.
[01:13] In the first year of Superhuman, therefore, I interviewed hundreds of potential customers
[01:17] about their experience with Gmail and with Outlook. And predictably, almost everybody
[01:23] said that email takes way too much time. But interestingly, many people also said that Gmail
[01:30] and Outlook were way too slow. And that was how I first thought that speed could be an
[01:37] interesting position for us. I then asked myself, is the position of speed unique and is it available?
[01:43] And the answer was overwhelmingly yes, because almost no software was being sold or has ever
[01:50] been sold on the value proposition of speed. The last time I could remember anyone trying to do this
[01:57] was when Google launched Chrome. And obviously, that went incredibly well for them. And you may
[02:02] remember they had slow motion videos where they were comparing Chrome render web pages and showing
[02:09] that was faster than an actual strike of lightning. No one had done it since then. And I then asked,
[02:17] well, does speed reinforce our product strategy? And again, the answer was overwhelmingly yes.
[02:22] I knew that our competition was not going to be startups. It was incumbents. And I also knew
[02:28] that incumbents generally struggle with speed, because by definition, they have massive scale
[02:33] and usually entrenched architecture. And then finally, I did what I call the cocktail party test,
[02:40] which is to look at the cocktail parties and to watch how people pitch your product to other
[02:46] people. And in our case, the pitches were simple. People would say, dude, you have to use it. It's
[02:53] really fucking fast. And that's it. That was the pitch. And that's how I knew that speed would
[02:58] be a really great position for us to start with. I'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert,
[03:03] the founder of One Schema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Hi, Christina. Yes, thank you
[03:08] for having me on, Lenny. What is the latest with One Schema? I know you now work with some of my
[03:14] favorite companies like Ramp, Vanta, Scale, and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new
[03:19] product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs. Yes. So we
[03:26] just launched One Schema file feeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15
[03:31] minutes, as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting
[03:36] stuck with hacks and workarounds. And the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down
[03:40] prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer
[03:44] thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all. I can tell you that if
[03:48] my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my
[03:53] roadmap and instead use something like One Schema and not just to build it, but also to maintain it
[03:58] forever? Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just
[04:03] a handful of bad records. We have laser focused on integration reliability to help teams end all
[04:08] of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any
[04:13] bad data from entering your system. And One Schema will notify your team immediately of any data that
[04:17] looks incorrect. I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers
[04:22] and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us. And if you want to learn more,
