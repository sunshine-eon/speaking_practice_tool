============================================================

[40:49] in driving that kind of complex system as well.
[40:52] One more question along these lines.
[40:54] You've been at LinkedIn for a long time.
[40:56] It feels like historically LinkedIn,
[40:59] like as a product team,
[41:00] the external impression was it's very optimized oriented
[41:05] and everyone there is just micro-optimizing
[41:07] all the little features of LinkedIn,
[41:09] like everyone I've worked with from LinkedIn,
[41:11] they're just really good at just optimizing things.
[41:15] And it feels like a lot of new stuff
[41:18] is happening with LinkedIn these days.
[41:19] And I'm curious if that's been like a real intentional shift
[41:23] of like, let's not focus so much on making emails work better
[41:28] and like all the, you know, click-through rates of everything.
[41:30] And more just, let's innovate more,
[41:32] let's do some bigger bets.
[41:34] I do think there's two things that to kind of acknowledge.
[41:36] First, it's an incredible growth team.
[41:37] And I think a lot of people that go on from LinkedIn
[41:40] in incredible roles are growth.
[41:41] So I think there's an influence or change
[41:43] that a lot of people you meet might be growth oriented.
[41:45] The second thing is, especially when LinkedIn started,
[41:49] I, you know, like you said, I've been here a little bit of time,
[41:52] but growing the network is probably a very, very important thing
[41:55] to get the scale out.
[41:56] So I think a lot of things people interacted with at first
[41:58] were maybe more growth mechanisms than other systems.
[42:02] I do think there's always been, at least for the last,
[42:05] you know, several years, an underlining line
[42:08] that values what's going to carry this ecosystem
[42:10] and values ultimately what makes the day.
[42:12] And to your point, I like to think that, you know,
[42:15] they may not be the most, I don't know, the glittery items,
[42:18] right?
[42:19] But I'm really proud of what we've done with skills.
[42:22] I think that's like one of those invisible systems
[42:24] that no one really knows, like, oh my gosh,
[42:26] that's a huge disruption that people can now get.
[42:28] That's a huge language that people have created.
[42:30] That's a huge way that people have changed.
[42:32] We're really proud of what we've done with kind of values,
[42:34] even open to work and commitments.
[42:36] These are major social systems that we've kind of wired
[42:39] through.
[42:39] I'm really proud of what we've done with LinkedIn Learning.
[42:41] I would argue it's one of the bigger creator systems
[42:43] in the world.
[42:44] It's these incredible instructors and the ability
[42:46] to take someone who teaches, maybe is not great kind of on camera
[42:50] and move them to the studio and give them that capability
[42:52] and take their voice out there.
[42:54] And I think there's a lot of different things we've done
[42:56] that maybe because they're more invisible, if you will,
[43:00] or they're hidden in a marketplace that necessarily,
[43:04] maybe a lot of the influencer voices may not actually need
[43:08] and access every day.
[43:10] I don't know if they get as much visibility,
[43:12] but I like to think that's been part of the DNA for a while,
[43:15] and we've been really thinking through it.
