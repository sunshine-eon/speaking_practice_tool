============================================================

[00:00] exactly what we're trying to do.
[00:01] I'm going to keep us on the AI thread and take us to AI Corner, which is a recurring
[00:05] segment on this podcast.
[00:06] So here's the question, what's the way you found in your personal life and work life
[00:11] to use AI where it ends up being really helpful, something really interesting that people might
[00:14] find useful?
[00:15] So many things.
[00:17] So AI is often the first, if I'm like having an idea, it'll be the first place that I go
[00:22] and explore the idea.
[00:24] And now with Canva, and you can just tag Canva, I can say, give me more ideas of this.
[00:28] And it's like shockingly great because it has all of the context from the design.
[00:31] It's actually integrated deeply into your workflow.
[00:35] Another really fun thing I do is an AI walk.
[00:38] And it's when I just put my ear pods in and then I go for a walk and I just say everything
[00:43] on my mind.
[00:44] And I use that to then kind of filter out my thoughts and figure out what are the things
[00:48] I need to action.
[00:49] And it kind of helps, again, get out of the weeds and think about things from a more macro
[00:53] perspective rather than from the things that might be in my Slack messages or in my email.
[00:59] It just gives you that sort of helpful vantage point I find.
[01:02] So yeah, so many things.
[01:05] For the voice note tool, is there a tool that you find useful for that?
[01:09] Yeah, I might use Apple Notes or directly into Canva Docs and then I actually just do
[01:14] the brain dump into Canva Docs and then just summarize them.
[01:19] So yeah.
[01:20] Got it.
[01:21] And so you just use native microphone?
[01:23] Exactly.
[01:24] Vacation sort of thing, nothing fancy.
[01:25] Yeah.
