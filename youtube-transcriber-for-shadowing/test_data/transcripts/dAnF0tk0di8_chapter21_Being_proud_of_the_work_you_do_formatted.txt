============================================================

Just to push back, I imagine there are expectations, like hoping this works out. I hope people adopt it. I hope it becomes the best email client in town, right? There's a sense of wanting this to succeed. That's pride, though; it's a matter of wanting to be proud of the work that we did. We really hope people like it, and we want to keep doing it. That’s a sense of caring about the work itself. It's not so much about the outcome, which you don't control as much as you might think.

Clearly, we want people to accept the work that we do, and we want to find enough people who like it to make it sustainable. But I don't have them in mind. I mean, this is going to sound selfish, but I have me in mind first. Because if I'm not for me first, it's hard to be for someone else. So I'm for us. We want to make things that we're proud of, that we think are really good, that are unique and bring something new to the world that doesn't exist. Otherwise, there's no point in doing it.

We want to create products that bring a different perspective—one that only we can provide because everyone has their own. We want to make sure ours is very visible in the products that we make, which is why we approach things very differently than most. Our products are very different than most, and that's why they should be there. We should provide alternatives. As I said earlier, I don't like the word competition because it almost sounds like you could be making the same thing. I want to provide an alternative—a different approach, a different way forward.

It could be in pricing, in the way something works, in the flows of the thing, or it could be the entire conception of the thing. But it should be an alternative. If it's not an alternative, it doesn't need to exist. So that's how I think about it. But yeah, there are expectations, or I should say maybe it's more like there are desires and hopes of acceptance to some degree because it needs to be accepted; otherwise, we can't stay in business.

But really, it's about whether we are proud of it first. We're wrapping up the Hey Calendar right now—it's the calendar we're building for our Hey email service. I'm really proud of it. I have no idea what's going to happen; it's very unusual. But I'm really proud of the work that we did, and that's enough for me. I think it's going to do well; I don't know, though. It doesn't really make any sense to wonder if it will or not. It just will or it won't. All I can do is be proud of the work that we're doing and be proud of the people who are doing it. I feel like we're putting something out in the world that we think should be here. Whether or not people agree is up to them.
