[00:00] sideways. Awesome. That's exactly what I was going to ask is who who's the ultimate decider of taste
[00:04] and what is good. And so it sounds like basically Toby up above and then he's kind of deputized Glenn
[00:11] and relies on him to make a lot of these final calls. Yes. And that yeah, okay. And then I imagine
[00:17] Glenn has some folks that he kind of deputizes to make smaller decisions along the way
[00:22] or not. Yes. Or he's very involved in everything. Yeah. And I think I think this is the fun
[00:26] thing on Shopify literally like we have our own internal project management system that's been
[00:31] kind of crafted just for Shopify and every show is that called by the way it's got like a cool name
[00:35] right GSD GSD. Yeah. Yeah. So get it done. And every project you got a core project,
[00:46] you know, emergency service, you got a growth project. And the expectation is that the group
[00:50] leaves every single project that goes out has a few minute video with figmas and everything
[00:56] and everything that shipped needs to be okay to so approved by the group. There's nothing that can
[01:02] ship without that okay to approval. And then okay to approval has to be Glenn, Karl, myself
[01:07] with different groups. And so that is kind of how the everything is reviewed. Now, of course,
[01:12] there's great amazing teams that do amazing work. But it is kind of that. That's how the
[01:18] system system works. And okay to specifically means someone above reviews it or all you this
[01:24] whole team, everyone looks at it. No, just so Glenn reviews the core stuff.
[01:28] Got it. Just car reviews the MS. Okay, too. So it's interesting. It's basically Glenn
[01:36] is founder mode and not as a founder where he's involved in all the details. Yes. Has
[01:40] final say. So this is a really cool example of founder mode, but not as a founder and
[01:45] corrects in the way you guys operate. And I imagine sometimes Toby disagrees with Glenn
[01:50] and then they talk about it and things get ironed out. Totally. And that's why we come together
[01:53] every six weeks, kind of everyone in person to review every project so we can hash out those
[01:58] disagreements, go through all the core projects, all the merge service products, all the growth
[02:02] projects. And it's a great form to say, Hey, here's where we disagree room how and the
[02:07] tactics of what's happening. It's and we can flag those things have good debates
[02:11] about whether might be misalignment. Amazing. What a what a unique way of working. I'm so
[02:16] fascinated by all this. So what I'm hearing essentially within core Glenn and his team
[02:22] come up with here's we're going to build the next quarter. You guys have a twice a year
[02:25] releases. Is that right? Or is it every season? Yeah, so big kind of additions twice a year
[02:30] obviously continually shipping, but we got to package them twice a year and a big,
[02:34] yeah, big launch. Yep. I've seen those. Okay. So he's like, here's what we're
[02:38] going to do in the next release. We're just going to build this because we think this is
[02:41] right. And we're not driving a specific goal building for 100 years in the future.
[02:46] Let's just build it. And basically you build it. He's like, this is great, not great,
[02:50] iterate until it's this good. And then ship and and great. Okay, this is great.
[02:55] Okay, so then there's that that team and then there's your team, which is like drive some
[02:58] freaking numbers.
