============================================================

[00:00] couple more questions. There's one that I skipped that I'm just going to come back to. It's
[00:04] completely out of nowhere, but I think it might be interesting is about a global data
[00:09] org. So you run a global data org, give data scientists and analysts and biz-offs
[00:14] people all over the world, not just the US. I'm curious just how is it different managing
[00:20] data people in different countries versus just the US? What's the big difference?
[00:25] No one always asks about the differences. What I am surprised by is how similar things are.
[00:31] How similar people are, the data scientists themselves, but also consumers and dashers
[00:37] and couriers, as we call them at Volt. There's a lot more similarities than differences.
[00:43] I do think that when you built a business in the US and then you introduce new countries,
[00:49] having different currencies and different languages adds complexity that you weren't necessarily
[00:57] familiar with. I think similarly in EU countries versus non-EU countries in Europe, there's
[01:05] different regulation. So that adds a fun layer of complexity. So I do think that it adds
[01:11] complexity to the problem set. Ultimately, so many of the problems are the same. It feels
[01:20] a little bit like going into a test, like having seen the answer key. For me, there are problems
[01:29] we've encountered at Volt, through Volt Analytics, where I'm like, oh, I feel we've had a
[01:36] similar problem. I have an instinct for what the answer might be. Let's still test because
[01:42] there could be differences, cultural or otherwise. But I feel like I know where we're going to
[01:49] end. And then sometimes there are problems where it's new for one reason or another
[01:53] and it's exciting. You're like, all right, let's see if things are different here.
[01:57] Let's see what ideas might work in a Volt country that don't work in a DoorDash country in vice
[02:07] versa. So I think I tend to focus more on what's the same and then I'm pleasantly surprised
[02:13] when I find things that are different because that keeps you on your toes and keeps things
[02:17] interesting.
