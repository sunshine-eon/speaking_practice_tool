============================================================

[11:10] that people can find and see.
[11:12] Awesome.
[11:13] Again, I know this isn't like the area
[11:15] you spend all your time on,
[11:16] but maybe one more question along these lines.
[11:19] Give any sense of the kind of content
[11:20] that works best on LinkedIn in terms of the algorithm?
[11:25] You talk about like the algorithm
[11:26] is probably one of the bigger impact,
[11:28] things that have changed.
[11:29] If there's anything with knowledge or advice,
[11:32] I think that's what a lot of people are looking for.
[11:34] Every time we run these surveys,
[11:35] every time we talk to people on what they want,
[11:37] those are the things that really,
[11:38] when you connect to opportunity,
[11:39] that people kind of seek after on our system.
[11:41] And you're a great example of that, right?
[11:44] You're able to give knowledge and advice in an area
[11:46] with a lot of depth.
[11:47] And I think that maybe that's why you're having
[11:50] some of the success you're seeing on the platform,
[11:51] which is wonderful to see.
[11:53] I think I'm actually not getting as much success
[11:54] as I could because I don't put in the time.
[11:57] I usually just kind of post a simple thing with a link.
[12:00] And I think I could be if I really,
[12:02] like I just don't have time to do this,
[12:04] I've just like post a lot more stuff within the actual post.
[12:07] I think that would do better.
[12:09] That actually makes me happy.
[12:10] I mean, my guess is what you want to be doing
[12:12] is learning and creating and not spending a lot of time
[12:15] kind of managing the,
[12:16] and so maybe that's actually a good thing.
[12:18] And I'm, it's actually another wonderful thing to hear.
[12:20] Yeah, absolutely.
