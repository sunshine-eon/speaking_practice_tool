============================================================

[48:17] had to diagnose them and post-mortem.
[48:19] A lot of people listening to this
[48:20] are people that want to get into product management
[48:22] and aren't PMs yet.
[48:24] I imagine you get asked this a lot.
[48:26] How do I get into product management?
[48:27] What is your advice that you often give?
[48:29] Yeah.
[48:30] Well, let's start with how we looked at the world, which
[48:32] is this idea of skills.
[48:35] We have a diagram that I think about,
[48:37] which is skills are kind of on a triangle.
[48:39] You might have heard this one before.
[48:40] I don't know if you have.
[48:40] Skills are on a triangle.
[48:41] I think you need three different skills to be a great PM.
[48:44] You need to be a Spielberg-type creator.
[48:48] Something around data science and the ability
[48:50] to really look at data and see patterns
[48:52] and see the future.
[48:53] And then, especially, you get more senior credit.
[48:55] I think it's a lot of general management.
[48:56] You have to basically be able to shine on an innovative
[48:58] across the team, understand the budget,
[48:59] or understand how companies can work.
[49:01] I've actually never seen a great PM who's in the center of it.
[49:05] I find the great PMs live on the edges.
[49:08] There's always someone who's this exceptional data
[49:10] science and the ability to maybe be a great GM and lead
[49:13] inspire, or maybe someone who's so creative who
[49:16] can lead a team in a different way.
[49:18] And I think that one thing I would really, really
[49:22] encourage people to do is understand where they fit
[49:24] on that graph and gravitate towards those kinds of roles.
[49:27] Because a lot of times, I think what people do
[49:29] is they think they have to make up
[49:30] for the other pieces of that graph.
[49:32] And it leads them to a path where maybe they're not
[49:34] playing to their strengths.
[49:35] That's one thing I was encouraged me.
[49:37] The other thing I would say, and I know it's a little bit
[49:40] of luck in how this works, but I think about my journey.
[49:43] One thing I've really found was really helpful.
[49:46] I was lucky to have, I was on the first team that
[49:48] did a hybrid SUV in the US.
[49:51] At the time, it was the hybrid escape at Ford.
[49:53] And I came from the Midwest.
[49:54] And it was one of those products where people would really
[49:57] drive out for hundreds of miles and see,
[49:59] and really a community gravitate around.
[50:02] Because it was a very special product.
[50:04] And being able to work on something that people loved,
[50:07] I really loved early on, and see what that felt like and looked
[50:10] like and that success was, it kind of created a bar for what
[50:13] I would hope my products could do.
[50:16] And if you're able to get into something that people really
[50:19] love and feel that and experience that and really
[50:21] understand what that looks like and what it takes to get there,
[50:24] I think that's actually been a really valuable lesson
[50:26] throughout my career.
[50:27] Because you can understand the whole path on the way up.
[50:29] And I look back at that as really something that I would
[50:32] hope other people, if they can do it.
[50:33] I know you're making role decisions on many different criteria,
[50:36] but try to find something people love and really experience
[50:39] of what that feels like.
