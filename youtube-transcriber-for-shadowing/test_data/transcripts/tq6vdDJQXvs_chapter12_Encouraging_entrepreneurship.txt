Time: 77:15 - 79:34
============================================================

[00:00] I want to come back to something you talked about, which is focusing on entrepreneurship
[00:04] and the merchants that you all work with.
[00:06] And to me, this is another example of maximizing human potential.
[00:11] And the way I think about this, people always talk about MyCombinator and Stanford and all
[00:15] these places that create all these companies and founders.
[00:18] If you think about it, Shopify does this like orders of magnitude beyond.
[00:23] And I don't think you guys get enough credit for that, the amount of businesses
[00:27] you create, the amount of lives you change.
[00:28] Because we don't want the credit.
[00:30] That's the point.
[00:31] We don't want to credit for it.
[00:33] I mean, maybe if you wanted it, we could also not get it.
[00:35] But that's kind of like, we don't need to explore that because we actually
[00:39] literally don't want the credit.
[00:40] It's like Shopify is a company that is like pushes from behind.
[00:44] We don't want to be written into the story.
[00:46] We want to just kind of help you do your thing.
[00:49] I think that's like, there's just too much grandeur in wanting to front it all.
[00:55] Like this is also what like caused us to go and help people build their own things
[01:01] rather than like start with a marketplace that like everyone gets to like lease
[01:06] a little component of at prices that correspond to magically exactly your margin.
[01:14] So as this usually goes in marketplaces.
[01:16] And so, yeah, I think I kind of think we don't, we kind of don't want it.
[01:21] I'm proud of it.
[01:22] But that's like intrinsic.
[01:24] I don't I don't need very extrinsic appreciation for it, I suppose.
[01:28] There's
[01:31] millions and millions of people that use Shopify daily.
[01:36] And that's that that is represents the business.
[01:39] And, you know, it caused a major amount of employment
[01:44] in, you know, around the world.
[01:46] Actually, it's definitely in like in North America specifically and Europe.
[01:52] And so I think that's really gratifying.
[01:54] I'm sure there's a way of saying that many of us businesses might actually
[01:59] have existed without Shopify.
[02:02] I also think you can make a case that a good number exists because of Shopify.
[02:08] Because what we've observed is that this was actually my favorite thing
[02:12] the entire Shopify journey that we sort of rigorously
