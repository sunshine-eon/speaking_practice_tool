============================================================

[00:00] drive growth, hit these goals. How do you collaborate across these two teams? Do you have a model
[00:06] for how you work together? Because these feel like very different ways of working.
[00:11] Yeah. Honestly, it's been one of the things I'm very proud of. We built a really great
[00:16] partnership over the last three and a half years because it's intentionally meant to be
[00:21] almost at odds. And that's like part of the structure of how you want to work.
[00:26] But it comes from, I think, a place of respect on both sides. I don't say for anyone. It's,
[00:31] okay, here's what growth is going to do. We're going to do it in a way that is high quality,
[00:35] that is shipping really good stuff for merchants. We're probably going to approach it in a
[00:40] faster way. We might disagree on things, but we're going to have reasonable paths to
[00:45] kind of handle that conflict. And so a lot of it's no magic bullet. It wasn't like,
[00:49] these are the surfaces that growth can touch. These are not. It's like, you can go anywhere
[00:53] in the product, but let's go figure out how to work together to figure out that quality bar,
[01:01] to understand when you're going to be different on it, on the quality bar to get something out to
[01:05] learn and just building trust along the way that we're actually going to chip high quality things
[01:10] when we ship it to 100% and move. And so a lot of great work on the team to make that,
[01:15] those relationships really strong. Got it. So basically you guys are like,
[01:19] moving this button over here is going to drive so much growth. And then Glenn's like,
[01:22] no, this is not acceptable. We don't want a button here. This looks terrible. Everyone's
[01:26] going to hate it. So it's, so that's the healthy tension. Like I'm describing.
[01:30] That's healthy tension. Yeah, totally. And it's like, okay,
[01:32] so how are we going to, how are we going to work to figure this out? It might be,
[01:35] hey, we're going to move the button. Hey, let's run that, let's run the test.
[01:37] Let's see the short-term list. You know, we're going to monitor it long-term.
[01:40] You know, when we ship it, it's going to be high quality, like high quality polish.
[01:45] Okay. Do you trust us to like make those, those trade-offs? And I, I wish I had a
[01:49] better answer of like, it's very human, right? And it's very that trust. That's very,
[01:56] that's very important. Any of these, I think growth with other teams is like,
[01:59] there's no replacement for that's the human trust. And then following through on commitments of,
[02:05] no, we're actually going to make this thing really good.
[02:07] Is there an example of that that comes to mind where you had something that was,
[02:10] you thought was going to drive meaningful growth? You showed it to Glenn. He's like, no,
[02:16] I don't know about this. And then either you iterated or you just like forget it.
[02:20] But this isn't right for the platform. Even though it's going to drive some meaningful growth.
[02:24] The place that we, we often come back to is, and this is with, you know,
[02:30] I think Toby is great. Toby and Glenn is on Wizards.
[02:36] So Wizards are onboarding carousels. Onboarding carousels.
[02:40] Some way that basically has folks get set up by not using the actual product.
[02:48] And so we've, oh, we've always kind of danced around and we have a very specific no wizard
[02:54] principle. But I think that sometimes the tension is Wizards do serve a,
[03:00] can serve a purpose in certain circumstances. And so we've, but we've avoided
[03:04] doing that, but we've always worked to try to make the principles of what a wizard does really well,
[03:10] which is it, it simplifies the product into something that allows people to have a lower bar
[03:17] to try to work with core to bring that into the actual experience itself. So the example
[03:23] of that experiment I mentioned to you of giving pre-filled sections in the online store editor,
[03:29] you could have solved that in a wizardy way of like enter a few things
[03:33] and we're going to generate these sections for you. Instead, we actually took those pre-generated
[03:39] things based on what we know about you and put it into the actual product experience itself.
[03:45] So it tried to get at some of the principles or what a wizard can do well without avoiding
[03:51] the wizard principle without creating actual wizard. So that's been some of the like,
[03:56] how do we work together to get the intent of what the growth idea has been in a way that's
[04:00] consistent with the way we want to build in core. Got it. And I get why you think about this a lot
[04:07] because you talked about one of the biggest levers is onboarding and helping more people get
[04:10] to activate it. And so I could see why you spent a lot of time thinking about how do we help
[04:14] more people succeed there. Yes.
