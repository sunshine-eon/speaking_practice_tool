Chapter 18: How setting ambitious goals improves team performance

============================================================

A defining characteristic of Brian Chesky, in my mind, is how big you make people think, how you push people to think bigger. Memories I have of you are in meetings where we present our goals, and you're always saying, "How do we 10x this? What would it take to 10x this idea?" Somehow, we often hit these crazy goals after you 10x them or sometimes just double them. What have you learned about the power of setting really ambitious goals, but also finding the balance with not demoralizing people if they don't hit these really ambitious goals?

As you know, there was a saying inside of Airbnb: "Add a zero, add a zero at the end," which is to imagine something orders of magnitude bigger. The exercise isn't necessarily to say, "If people say they want to hit a goal, I say, okay, I added a zero; you have to hit that goal." It's more about the exercise of considering what it would take to be 10x bigger or do something 10x better. When you push people, they sometimes think about the problem differently. One of the best ways to get unstuck from a problem is to imagine a 10x scale, where you can't do the current process to achieve it. You have to think differently about the problem.

To think differently about the problem means you have to deeply understand it. To deeply understand the problem, you have to break it into its components. We might call this first principle thinking, which is one of the foundational elements that comprise this problem. How can we reconstruct them? The first thing is that by adding a zero, at least conceptually, teams can better understand a problem.

The second important thing for a founder or leader to do is set the pace of the team. I think the pace of the team is one of the most important things you can influence. That pace is sometimes governed not by how hard people work, but by how decisive they are. If you want to improve the speed of a company, then make faster decisions. Fast decisions come from a bias of action. If we're in a meeting, we don't just say, "Okay, let's circle back on this next week." No, we’ll have it done by next week. Let's stay in this meeting until it's done. What are you doing? Have a bias for action. Who's responsible? Okay, what are you doing? Let's check in an hour. I'll call you in the morning. How are we going to do this? You end up getting three months of work done over that period of time.

The last thing I'll say about adding a zero, Lenny, is a story about a great basketball coach named John Wooden. He was one of the winningest basketball coaches in college basketball history, perhaps the greatest. Someone once asked him, "What is your secret to success?" He said, "I just ask my players to do their very best." I remember thinking that doesn't sound like the secret to success—asking people to do their best. But there was an implicit thing he didn't say: he saw potential in people that they never saw in themselves.

The role of a leader is to see potential in people that they may not even see in themselves. When I tell somebody it's not good enough, I'm either saying they're not good enough or I believe they have more potential than they're showing me. You can push a team, and they could feel demoralized because they feel like what they're doing is not good enough if they have a fixed mindset. Alternatively, you can create a growth mindset organization where the more I'm involved, the more I say you can do better, because the more I believe in you and know that you have more in you.

The way to know if a team could do better is to ask: if their life depended on it, could they do it? Andy Grove used to say that there's competency and motivation. Motivation is if they, not literally, depended on it, but if it was a crisis or a defining moment in their lives. The job of a leader is not to make it life and death—that's too far—but to motivate a team to see potential in themselves that they don't see. To really push them to set a tempo, to break something down to first principle thinking. If you do that, then I think that's going to be the opposite of these slow-moving, soul-crushing bureaucracies.
