Of us that gives a lot more meaning to our work than just getting rich. Okay. So speaking of product, coming back to that, you guys are launching something. Maybe you've already launched it by the time this comes out. What I heard described as the biggest launching canvas in history. No big deal. That's a high bar considering all the things you guys have launched. What are you launching? Why is it such a big deal?

We are extraordinarily excited about what we are launching. The whole mission of Canva is to empower the world to design. What has been enabled by new technology, especially with all of AI, has been really profound. It enables people to take their ideas and turn them into designs with as little friction between those two points as possible. So we are doubling down radically on our video product and bringing some incredible capabilities to our mobile and desktop platform.

We are launching email, which has been one of our most hotly requested features from enterprise customers and business customers around the world who want to design with Canva's drag-and-drop ease to create emails. We are also launching forms. Probably one of the most exciting things is the way we're embedding AI across the entire product suite. You can actually use AI to design a presentation, a video, an email, a website— all of these things can now be done inside the core editor within the design tab, which is used 170 million times a month.

On our elements tab, which is used 900 million times a month, we are also embedding AI. You can generate a video, a Canva code, and photos all directly inside that platform. Additionally, we are launching comments. Many of our customers use Canva to comment and collaborate. Now you can tag @Canva and collaborate seamlessly. You can say, “Hey, can you make this title shorter? Can you do this? Can you do that?” It has all the context of the design, so in situ, you can have a collaborator that helps get your work done. We are pretty excited about all of this.

Amazing. I have something I'm going to let people know. I don't know if people are aware of how many products you all have now. I think a lot of people think of Canva as just a design tool for graphics related to social media and marketing. But you also have spreadsheets, docs, whiteboards, charts, a code AI coding tool, and now, what I'm hearing is email forms. That's probably a few other things I'm not mentioning.

We truly design anything. We are literally living up to that. Like a hundred million people design a presentation in Canva each month now. It’s fascinating to see that when you speak to people, I saw a tweet some time ago talking about how it's a generational thing. A certain generation uses Microsoft, another uses Google, and then there’s Gen Z, where presentations have become the way they design a presentation in Canva. But it’s not just generational; it’s been fascinating to see how it spans across different generations.
