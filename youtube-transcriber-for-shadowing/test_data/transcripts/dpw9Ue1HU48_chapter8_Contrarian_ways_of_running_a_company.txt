============================================================

[00:00] What about from the perspective of just staying excited and motivated and finding things to take on?
[00:06] Is there any lessons there for founders that are I don't know at a larger company and just okay
[00:11] This is gonna help me stay excited about what I'm doing. Yeah, I think this is in Bezos exemplifies this
[00:17] I think the best which is
[00:20] Just because you're a public company does not mandate that you do certain things all you all that's necessary is
[00:27] The kind of transparency that says here is what the company is doing. Here's what we're about
[00:31] Here's what we're solving and he had this with his very first annual shareholders letter
[00:34] Which you know, you obviously writes every year, which is this is what Amazon is about
[00:38] We're solving for the long term or whatever and and he didn't say this in a starky way if you could reread the letter
[00:43] It's like but but if you read between the lines, it's like if you don't agree with this approach
[00:48] You should not buy Amazon shares, right? It's like it's a completely
[00:52] Optional thing you don't have to buy it
[00:54] But this is the way we're going to run the business and he stayed true to that
[00:57] And you can continue to do that. I'll tell you one quick story. This is what's again the
[01:01] To anti dissuade founders that might be reluctant to go public
[01:05] So one of the core values that HubSpot that's been part of the culture from the early early early early days
[01:11] literally days is transparency
[01:13] And so one of our kind of mechanisms by which we implement transparency is as we've had this thing that does all
[01:19] information within HubSpot is
[01:21] Equally shared with every one of the company
[01:24] Period
[01:27] Right like everything so our balance sheet with the we raise capital at
[01:31] You know whether you know we're gonna be able to me payroll in six weeks all those things everything was transparent all the time
[01:38] And with two exceptions one is if it was illegal for us to share
[01:41] Let's say if we were looking at some acquisition or whatever that we had
[01:44] non-disclosure or
[01:46] The information was ours not completely ours to share and one example of that was salaries
[01:51] So we feel that salaries are co-owned
[01:54] Both by the company and by that individual and it's not up to us to share someone's salary if they don't want to do that
[02:00] Alright, so so we had that transparency and then as we go public
[02:05] We have this meeting with our investment bankers and our lawyers. This is like in the IPO prep process
[02:11] And they sit down and it's part of this all-day meeting one of the questions is like, okay
[02:16] So so who are your designated insiders?
[02:19] Brian nor I had ever taken a company public before we're like, we don't know what that is
[02:24] It's like, oh, it's this kind of group of people that will have access to kind of all the financials and we'll know
[02:28] You know, it's like and we're like, oh, okay, so how long is that list and they're like, you know five or six
[02:34] And so then you know Brian says seven
[02:37] Seven and they're like, yeah, you could you could do seven and that I say eight
[02:41] Like could you do eight and so what we're and so we discovered through that mathematical induction process
[02:47] Is like if it's a true for N is a true friend plus one is that there's no actual legal limit to how many insiders a company can have
[02:54] And so we ended up doing literally the day we went public as we designated every single employee to be a designated insider
[03:02] So that allowed us to maintain the transparency thing because there was no rule that said you could only have five six ten
[03:08] And it was hundreds of people and we did not make it optional. We didn't say oh because our downsides to being an insider
[03:14] There's windows within which you can't trade. There's there's stuff
[03:17] but we're like, okay, well, we believe in transparency everyone's going to have access to it and
[03:22] And it's not an opt-in kind of thing. You're like, you're this is it
[03:25] We're all in together and and it's been all and we still do this to this day, right?
[03:28] Even at 7,000 people
[03:30] Everybody's inside so so we can still share all the financials with everyone all the time
[03:34] You have many contrarian opinions is what I'm getting from this conversation already and the way you're pushing the envelope on
[03:40] Can we have 10? Can we have a thousand?
[03:43] Curious if there's anything else there just
[03:47] Contrarian ways of running a company. I know there's probably many but what comes to mind?
[03:52] So one of the phrases we like to use in our industry overall is this kind of notion of first principles
[03:58] I know who popularized it, but it's used a lot
[04:02] I'm not usually a snarky, but I'm not gonna say something starty
[04:05] But I think most of the time first principles is used
[04:09] It's actually used incorrectly
[04:11] Because the way first principles are supposed to work as Elon would probably describe it is that it's not first principles like the first principles of
[04:18] What we believe these are a core kind of first principles in the company. It's the first principles of the universe
[04:22] It's not what you believe is true is what do we all collectively know to be true to the best of our knowledge?
[04:27] It's science right that's like physics like the first and second law of thermal dynamics
[04:31] Those are first principles
[04:32] All the layers on top of that are things that you think are true are your assumptions or the things that decisions you made
[04:37] And that's fine like you may have made some decisions like for instance transparency is not a first principle
[04:42] It's a founding principle, right? It's not like everyone should do this. It's like a completely core thing. And so yes, I
[04:50] can be
[04:51] Contrarian, but you have to kind of limit the dimensions
[04:55] So the number of things that you're contrarian on
[04:57] Have to be greater than zero, but not too high, right? So you want what I think of is like
[05:03] high conviction
[05:05] Low consensus bets, right? So high conviction is we really really believe this and low
[05:11] Consensus is that most other people don't and the other people have kind of phrased this differently
[05:15] I think Peter Teal actually says it more simply and elegantly, which is you need to be right about something that other people think you're wrong
[05:20] About for a very long time, right? Like okay, this is the thing that and you just happen to be right
[05:25] So one of the early kind of high conviction decisions we made
[05:29] At HubSpot was that we were gonna focus on SMB as our target market
[05:34] And I'll make a case both for SMB and for having high conviction better
[05:38] It doesn't have to be a target market, but something once you make that bet
[05:43] Because it's low consensus
[05:44] it's going to be hard and necessary for you to have the conviction because everyone disagrees including your board including your investors including potential investors
[05:51] So we have that for all literally all 18 years of HubSpot's history
[05:55] We have always had the quick all during the IPO road shows like yes, we get that you've kind of on SMB
[06:01] But so what's the path to the enterprise?
[06:04] No, you don't understand. This is not a go-to-market strategy. This is not like oh, we're gonna conquer SMB first
[06:08] This is not bowling pin. This is not Jeffrey Moore. This is a we are here for SMB. This is that's what we're doing
[06:14] And so we maintain that conviction for a very long time and that kind of helps you
[06:20] make other bets that are secondary but
[06:23] But you don't want to reinvent everything
[06:25] So I'll give an example of something that we had in the early years of HubSpot that the only kind of forwent
[06:29] So in the early years of HubSpot, we're like, okay, we believe in a flat organization
[06:35] One of the manifestations of that flat organization is we had no titles in the company. Nobody had a title
[06:40] Right. So even though we like you have business cards, whatever we have no titles
[06:43] If you introduce yourself, you know in a meeting and we had this up to like hundreds of people
[06:49] When you introduce yourself like oh, I work in product. I work in engineering or whatever
[06:53] It's not like I'm director of X or VP of Y because that as a thing didn't exist
[06:57] Then as we scaled we came to the realization that there's actual
[07:04] Value that people ascribe to titles and the reason they ascribe value to titles is because
[07:09] There were rumors that there was life beyond HubSpot
[07:12] Like that. I couldn't believe it. What there's there's a life out there outside of HubSpot
[07:16] It's like, yeah, but look and then when we go to the Thanksgiving dinner or whatever and I talked to my aunt I
[07:21] Need some shorthands like oh, yeah, like I got promoted to director
[07:24] I got probably like, you know, just show some progression because it's a signaling device and in this life beyond HubSpot and outside of HubSpot
[07:31] It's like other people are also didn't want to know sort of where I was and it's like, okay
[07:36] And this was the winning argument
[07:37] I love this argument because we had a day-long meeting on talking about this one topic and the winning argument was
[07:43] Dermation brought I recognize why you why we don't have titles
[07:46] I recognize this and so they made the case of yeah
[07:49] There's you know value and it's like and by virtue of you not giving us titles
[07:54] That means you're having to compensate us and you know kind of economic sense in other ways, right?
[08:00] So you're you're losing out because it's like is that value high enough to not do that?
[08:05] That's a strong case. It's like and so and then we headed down to three choices
[08:10] We're like, okay
[08:10] Well, we could have chosen to just stay firm. It's like still no titles. We could have said, okay
[08:14] We're gonna have classic titles
[08:16] Then I had the option on the table of make up your own title
[08:20] like you could be Grand Puba of X and that can be your like and
[08:24] Then we ended up making a decision to go with classic titles because that actually served the need of there's a benchmark
[08:29] It was a standard otherwise
[08:30] It doesn't mean anything so having made up titles is pretty much the equivalent of having no titles because they lack any any meat
[08:36] Anyway, but that's one of those things that okay, you sort of iterate you change things as they go
[08:42] Yeah, I think there's so much to this. Let's just try things differently. Okay, that didn't work. Let's okay
[08:47] We're fine
[08:47] We're just gonna do whatever else is doing here and then often you discover a thing that okay
[08:51] This is actually better
[08:53] Just to understand when people have no titles so someone say as a product manager, what do you call them a product manager?
[08:59] You're just like, I'm an employee HubSpot. I have no literally no title
[09:02] At the time we was a no title and now we have classic title. Yeah, we have levels of things and but back then it's like you're just here
[09:08] No title. We don't know exactly. I
[09:11] Saw somewhere that you paid everyone
[09:14] $5,000 monthly as their salary at the beginning HubSpot including yourselves for a long time. Yes, sorry
[09:19] Another fun fact. How long did that last by the way?
[09:22] Try to think back. It's you know, it's a long time ago. I want to say probably like the first year a year and a half
[09:27] amazing and
[09:29] and one of the things that and this is one of the kind of core and it
[09:33] Not everything that you know, we obviously not everything was right
[09:36] But not everything is kind of applicable to other companies, but there are some things that I think are
[09:41] And one of the things that I think are applicable is just this need to solve for like simplicity, right?
[09:47] It's like the simpler you can make things in the early years the better off you generally are so part of
[09:52] This is it's gonna sound weird. So
[09:55] How we wound up with transparency is not because of like some moral is like oh everyone deserved to have this and this is
[10:02] The truth so it's not some moral position
[10:05] It was a when we hired the first employee in this post of both writer and geeky
[10:12] When we had the first employee we had to make the decision. It's like oh
[10:16] So what files do we give them access to what what and so Brian is like
[10:21] Well, like why well
[10:22] There's nothing I like why would we why would we do that and so then we kind of the the output of that was like, okay
[10:29] Well a like binary decisions are much easier than non-binary decisions
[10:33] It's like okay
[10:34] Like everything or nothing is like much much simpler and then it's like okay
[10:38] Well if it works for employee, you know employee number three in the company, why wouldn't it work at four?
[10:43] Why wouldn't it work at five? Why wouldn't it work at 50 and we just kept doing it because it's like okay?
[10:48] Well until it breaks. We'll just keep doing that right and so this is the and this applies to so many different aspects of HubSpot
[10:55] But is we try to start with the simplest possible thing that might work and then if necessary
[11:02] Add the you know add the complexity add the things or whatever like even our original
[11:06] This is actually the tactical thing that everyone should take away especially early-stage startups
[11:10] Very first HubSpot office has exactly four tables because aspirations for growth, right?
[11:15] We were in a co-working space so we work back in the day here in Cambridge, Massachusetts
[11:20] And so we had four tiers and the only distinguishing characteristic of the four chairs
[11:25] There were two chairs that were by the window two chairs not by the window. Okay, great
[11:29] hire that first employee other decision we have to make is like, okay
[11:31] Well, where do people sit and it felt this one is like well feels unfair to us
[11:36] That we would just get the window seats or whatever it's like, okay
[11:39] We believe in a flat organization like why and so what we did is we said, oh, we'll just do a lottery
[11:45] Okay, and it's not like oh whoever pulls the thing gets the window seat
[11:49] Whoever pulls gets to choose from the remaining seats because different people ascribe different utility to different seats, right?
[11:55] It's like maybe you don't want a window seat
[11:56] Maybe you like the dark darker corner whatever it is and so we did that with employee number one
[12:01] Then it did that with employee number two and we did it every time we hired a new employee
[12:05] We would do a seat shuffle. We're gonna do the lottery
[12:08] We're gonna go down the sequence and of all the seats were that that was the algorithm, right?
[12:12] And our investors are like, oh, that's cute and that's funny
[12:16] It's not gonna work at 15 20 people. It's not good working 50
[12:20] Worked at 25 worked at 50 worked at 100 worked at 200. We updated the algorithm
[12:25] We did some local optimizations which we said, oh
[12:28] There are some groups that should not be next to other groups because engineers like quiet time and sales people don't
[12:33] And so we're gonna try to kind of
[12:36] Optimize a little bit so it's not completely random anymore. Now it's like within this product
[12:39] Well, we still would do it then we said, okay, we're not gonna do it for every hire
[12:43] We're gonna do it every quarter and that's stood by the way for
[12:47] Hundreds of people that mechanism still worked, right? It's like it's yeah, oh my god
[12:55] So the moral the story is
[12:57] That one decision of simplifying can you imagine the amount of politics we avoided like in
[13:03] Corporate America the amount of calories spent is like well your office is bigger than my office
[13:08] Your desk is one inch higher or one would it like no
[13:11] it's like all of that just went away by virtue of that one decision and we don't even know it's incalculable honestly like
[13:17] How much grief that like saved us and then there's all other kind of side benefits to it in terms of
[13:22] People getting to know each other better better chemistry. There was like lots of good upside
[13:26] But just the simplicity is almost always a better answer
[13:29] I love that everything often comes back to some algorithm you've developed or this n plus one approach of like
[13:34] Let's just keep going until something goes wrong. This is amazing
[13:37] I'm I'm excited for many more of these hilarious amazing examples of how you do things differently
