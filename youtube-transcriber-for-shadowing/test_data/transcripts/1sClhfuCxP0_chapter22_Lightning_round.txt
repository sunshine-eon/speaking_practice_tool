Time: 67:48 - 72:29
============================================================

[00:00] No problem. I want to go take it out. Get user feedback. I trade and so on. So understanding of the market a but be also understanding of
[00:09] their the core orientation
[00:11] comes back to your
[00:13] ongoing advice of being full-stack in a lot of ways and in this case being a full-stack PM thinking about marketing launch and adoption all those things
[00:22] Next question. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?
[00:27] The very recent product that I like is called rise
[00:32] It's a it's a
[00:34] Sleep hacking app and because I am kind of an half insomniac and for the longest time
[00:39] I was thinking about how can I track this so that what am I doing and how can I actually get better at this?
[00:46] So really like the way that they actually help help the end user. It's just in a week since I've started using it
[00:52] What recommended has that helped your sleep yet or too soon to say I said it's helped me track my sleep
[00:58] So it's and now it's it's getting into the zone where it is actionable, but I like it. Okay. We'll see
[01:05] Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to you like to share people kind of think about in either work or life?
[01:12] What quality life motto as as much but but one of the things that I keep telling like, you know my
[01:20] People who work with me alongside me and so on
[01:23] It's stop externalizing. That's one which also means
[01:27] The the more artistic way to say that is you are the reason for your own misery
[01:31] So that's something that keeps using a lot more in a fun way
[01:35] But if things go wrong if that leadership meeting didn't happen from that way if my product bombed and so on go back
[01:41] Let's ask ourselves
[01:42] What could we have done better what I could have done better and so on and of course because I'm also a poker player
[01:48] So so in a way, I understand there is half luck involved in half skill
[01:52] But what a long period of time if it's only luck and you're feeling and feeling and feeling you have to go and look back at your skill
[01:58] So
[02:00] Yeah, you are the reason for your misery. I love that advice being very empowering and be responsible
[02:07] Final question. I was talking your LinkedIn. You host an event called the secret secret soiree
[02:12] Which it's not that secret because you post about it
[02:14] But I'm curious is what is that all about and what got you to do these sorts of events?
[02:19] So we just started like me and an excalia of mind shawangi. So we
[02:25] We essentially wanted to meet cool people around. So that's how it started like interesting people
[02:30] without agenda who can come together and discuss
[02:34] interesting stuff about
[02:35] entrepreneurship about startups about
[02:38] Products about connections and so on so forth
[02:40] So it just started like that and now we are we are on to many many more interesting things that we are bringing in in terms of cohorts and
[02:48] Which will be team-based so it could be around around product management around marketing around growth and so on
[02:56] We are strictly keeping it known not for profit for at least the next year, but what long way to go
[03:03] Amazing and so for listeners is something that could join who should look at do this. Who's this for?
[03:08] Absolutely at that time, probably will not call you the secrets where once they have expanded no longer secret
[03:16] Okay, cool, and then I guess is they just follow you on LinkedIn, right? That's how they can keep up to date with these sorts of events
[03:21] Okay, cool. Yes on LinkedIn as well as on Twitter
[03:24] Awesome. Anuj we've gone through so many topics. We've talked about breaking bad and
[03:30] Full-stack product management full-stack thinking working backwards
[03:35] Burn butter rule of threes. I don't know so many things
[03:38] Two final questions working folks finding online if they want to reach out and follow up on anything
[03:42] We've talked about and how can listeners be useful to you? Yes, so I'm on Twitter
[03:46] So on Twitter comm slash Anuj Ratty and LinkedIn you can just search my name. I'm pretty active on both of them
