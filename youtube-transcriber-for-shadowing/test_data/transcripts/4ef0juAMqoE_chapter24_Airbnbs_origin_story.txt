============================================================

[00:00] And really Lenny, maybe to surround us a story because that was a fun fact, but I'm kind of just this is the pre founding story that I never tell.
[00:07] I don't think I could have ever done when I did if I wasn't an industrial designer. I think industrial designers different than a graphic designer.
[00:15] Because an industrial designer, you have to actually understand, you know, you have to work with engineering in your training. You have to like I worked with mechanical engineers, electric engineers, you have to understand manufacturing.
[00:26] Industrial science very accountable to sales. If you design a building, an architect, and you design office building, office building doesn't get leased. The architects usually not on the hook for it.
[00:36] But if you're an industrial designer, you're designed a product doesn't sell. You're like kind of on the hook for at least people assume you didn't design a good product.
[00:42] So you understand marketing and strategy. And so that became this gateway. But I didn't really want to make items and objects my whole life.
[00:52] But at RISD, the biggest value I got in addition to learning industrial design was I met my co founder Joe Gebbia.
[01:00] And the day of graduation, Joe looks to me says, Brian, I think we're going to start a company together one day. And I had no idea what he was referring to.
[01:07] So I moved to Los Angeles, where I work as an industrial designer for two years, when one day I got a package in the mail that changed my life.
[01:16] I opened this package, and it's a sea cushion with a handle on it. And it's a letter from Joe, my, my friend from RISD. He said, I started a company in everyone in San Francisco, I live in San Francisco, and all these people are starting companies, you should come here.
[01:32] And this is in 2007. YouTube had just come out. I like seeing all these Steve Jobs keynotes finally on YouTube. I didn't know who he was. I never heard his voice before, before YouTube.
[01:42] And Apple had this renaissance and Google was on fire and Facebook was taking off. And it felt like the gears of the world that we're turning were in San Francisco.
[01:52] And so one day I go into work and I quit my job, my boss is dumbfounded, and I pack everything in the old old backseat of old Honda Civic.
[02:01] I get to San Francisco and Joe tells me the rent is $1,150. I don't have enough money to pay a rent. This design conference came to San Francisco.
[02:10] All the hotels are sold out. We said, what if we turned our house into a bed and breakfast for design conference. I didn't have any beds, but Joe had three beds. We call it air bed and breakfast.
[02:19] So my fun fact was I was an artist and designer before Airbnb, really an artist, at least how I thought about it. And I think that's maybe one of the things that makes Airbnb different.
[02:31] Because there's not a lot of designers or artists running Fortune 500 or SAP 500 companies. And I think that intuition, imagination, design, curiosity.
[02:41] I think we need more of that. By the way, I think the people listening, I think everyone on this, what listen, you have these qualities. But I think that a lot of companies, it's like we're a body and the companies are cut off at the head.
[02:52] They're just some body from the heart and they're often really biased towards one side of their head. And I think some of the greatest scientists played musical instruments like Einstein. I mean, I think that by being a whole well rounded way of thinking about the world is good.
[03:07] So anyways, that's my final thought.
[03:11] I love that fun fact, because it almost explains everything you've been talking about, which is rethinking the way companies can run, doing things super differently. So I really appreciate you're showing that. I also love that a transition into the creation story of Airbnb, which happens a lot at Airbnb.
[03:24] People hear that story over and over because it's so interesting and so important. Brian, I know you have to run. Thank you so much for being here and being generous with your time.
