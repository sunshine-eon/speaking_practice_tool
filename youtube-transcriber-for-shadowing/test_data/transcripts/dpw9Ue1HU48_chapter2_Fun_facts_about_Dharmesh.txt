============================================================

[00:00] I'm a wildly fascinating human.
[00:01] And so I thought it'd be fun to start
[00:03] with just a bunch of fun facts
[00:04] that I found about you online.
[00:06] And what I'm thinking is I'll just walk through them,
[00:08] tell me if they're true as I walk through them.
[00:10] And then this is gonna lead to a bunch of different topics
[00:12] that I wanna talk about.
[00:13] How does that sound?
[00:14] That was great.
[00:15] Okay, here we go.
[00:16] So one, you have no direct reports
[00:17] and I don't believe you've ever had direct reports
[00:21] at HubSpot.
[00:22] That is correct.
[00:23] 7,000 plus employees, exactly zero direct reports
[00:26] from time t equals zero.
[00:27] Okay, we're gonna talk about that.
[00:29] You also don't do one-on-one meetings as a result.
[00:31] You don't have reports to have one-on-one meetings with.
[00:34] That's correct.
[00:35] You build many site projects while at HubSpot,
[00:37] including a product called WordPlay,
[00:40] which at one point made $90,000 per month
[00:42] and had 16 million users.
[00:45] That is correct.
[00:46] You also bought chat.com for $10 million,
[00:50] and then you sold it two months later
[00:51] for more money than you bought it for.
[00:54] It was actually $15 plus million dollars,
[00:57] but I had kind of stated eight figures,
[01:00] but yeah, is this breaking news?
[01:03] It's breaking news.
[01:04] Wow, so that's how much you bought it for.
[01:06] Yes.
[01:07] Okay, and you sold it still for an undisclosed amount.
[01:09] Is that right?
[01:10] Undisclosed amount, yeah.
[01:11] And more than that, college they got.
[01:12] Yeah, there was a profit
[01:13] and I knew you gave some money to charity
[01:15] and there's some promises you made
[01:16] where people commented on your LinkedIn post
[01:18] and you gave more money away, so that was awesome.
[01:20] Okay, also you're a billionaire.
[01:22] That is once again true.
[01:24] It's still true.
[01:25] Great.
[01:26] Also, you were born in a village in India
[01:28] that had no paved streets, no traffic lights, no hospitals.
[01:32] That is correct.
[01:33] Okay.
[01:34] Before HubSpot, you founded two companies,
[01:37] but I think the more important fact there is
[01:39] you promised your wife you would not start another company
[01:41] before you started HubSpot
[01:42] and then you ended up and went on and started HubSpot.
[01:45] Yes, I had promised her that I would not do Star.
[01:47] I had kind of hang up the proverbial entrepreneurial hat.
[01:51] Best lead plans and all that.
[01:53] I met my co-founder in grad school,
[01:54] which is that was the plan.
[01:56] So I'll go back to grad school and we'll find myself
[01:59] and then the plan was to go eventually teach,
[02:01] not do another startup,
[02:02] but I met my co-founder there
[02:04] and one thing led to another as these things go.
[02:07] I hope she's forgiven you.
[02:09] I do too.
[02:09] Ha ha ha.
