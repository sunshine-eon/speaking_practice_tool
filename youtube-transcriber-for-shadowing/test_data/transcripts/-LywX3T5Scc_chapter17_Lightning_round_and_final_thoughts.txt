============================================================

[00:00] Melanie, this was incredible.
[00:03] Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted
[00:07] to share or anything else you want to leave listeners with?
[00:09] You've been extremely extensive.
[00:11] I don't think I've got anything else.
[00:13] That's the goal.
[00:14] That's the goal.
[00:15] With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.
[00:17] Melanie, are you ready?
[00:18] Let's go.
[00:19] First question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to
[00:23] other people?
[00:24] One of the books I love is The Power of Moments.
[00:27] It talks, I'm supposed to be really fast and not tell you about it.
[00:30] It's all good.
[00:31] Okay, two books, The Power of Moments.
[00:35] One of the books early on I read was Designing the Obvious, which I found very insightful.
[00:39] Okay.
[00:40] I like that you shifted to fast mode.
[00:42] You don't have to go super fast.
[00:43] All good.
[00:44] What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?
[00:47] Not Canva.
[00:48] I love the Car Map.
[00:50] It is my daily companion.
[00:52] I use it to meditate.
[00:53] I use it to listen to music.
[00:56] I just find it very calming.
[00:57] Okay.
[00:58] First question, I usually ask about movies and TV shows.
[01:00] I hear you don't watch a lot because you're so busy enough, so much going on.
[01:03] I'm going to try a new question.
[01:04] I haven't asked before.
[01:05] I'm curious where this goes.
[01:07] Excluding Canva, what's a product you'd love to work on someday, whether it's like an existing
[01:13] other company, like, oh, I wish I could work on that thing, or just a new product you'd
[01:16] love to build maybe after the Canva chapter?
[01:19] I feel like my Canva chapter is going to go on for a long time.
[01:22] I don't know.
[01:23] I'm going to say.
[01:24] I'm going to say.
[01:25] I've got two separate plans that are pretty extensive.
[01:27] Maybe a company you'd love to fund.
[01:28] There we go.
[01:29] I feel like there is a lot of opportunity to create global infrastructure that is truly
[01:37] empowering.
[01:38] And so as I look at my 2050 wall, I think there's a lot of things that are currently
[01:44] only exclusively available to a small number of people that should be available to everyone.
[01:49] So the more that we can do to uplift the rising tide lifts or boats, I think, is a thing that's
[01:54] just so of such critical importance.
[01:58] And I think there is this weird belief that you can be fine and everyone else can be not
[02:04] fine, and that's all cool.
[02:06] I don't think that's cool.
[02:07] I think everyone suffers in such a case.
[02:09] So I think more things that help everyone to rise.
[02:14] Maybe along those lines, but maybe not.
[02:16] Is there a life motto that you find yourself coming back to in working your own life?
[02:21] There's a few.
[02:22] I love the quote, happiness is when what you think, what you say and what you do are in
[02:25] harmony.
[02:26] I feel like that's a constant aspiration.
[02:29] And then I've just been so obsessed lately with the idea that everything is led by imagination,
[02:35] that imagination is the very first step of that creative process.
[02:38] So everything is good because once imagined is a quote you're going to be seeing from
[02:41] Canva all the time now because it is true that if you don't imagine it, you can't will
[02:47] it into existence.
[02:48] And in fact, everything great that we experienced in life was first imagined.
[02:52] Wow, there's so much power to that.
[02:54] One thought nugget there is just there's always tools now that can make building so
[02:59] much easier.
[03:00] You can just build anything you want, just describe it.
[03:03] But so many people are just like, I'm going to say, but I'm just stuck.
[03:05] What do I want?
[03:06] I don't even.
[03:07] Like, I don't know what I mean.
[03:08] What should I build?
[03:09] And that's exactly what you're talking about there.
[03:11] Okay.
[03:12] Last question.
[03:13] So I saw it somewhere that you were a aspiring figure skater in your early years in high
[03:19] school.
[03:20] You had to wake up at 4.30 a.m. to practice.
[03:23] Is there something you learned from that period of your life that was helpful in building
[03:28] Canva?
[03:29] Oh, you so many things are quite directly applicable falling down over and over again
[03:33] and getting up and trying again.
[03:35] The importance of hard work and determination.
[03:38] I think the falling down, like it was quite literal in my figure skating in days.
[03:43] And maybe it's a little more metaphorical in today, but it is constant.
[03:49] To your right.
[03:50] I wonder what that metaphor is for figure skating.
[03:52] I don't know.
[03:53] Anyway, Melanie, this was incredible.
[03:55] I am so thankful that you agreed to do this.
[03:58] Two final questions.
[03:59] Where can folks find you if they want to maybe reach out, send you maybe feedback and canvass
[04:02] or join Canva?
[04:04] And how can listeners be useful to you?
[04:05] Really great questions.
[04:06] So you can find me on LinkedIn.
[04:08] That's where I post the most.
[04:11] And you can go to and I can get the URL to give us your wishes and we want to hear them
[04:17] and we literally listen to them.
[04:18] It doesn't just go into a suggestion box.
[04:22] And then how can they be helpful?
[04:26] Use Canva, spread Canva, teach Canva.
[04:29] We're doing a Canva World Tour in through October, which is probably going to be outdated
[04:34] and this is posted.
[04:37] We do events all around the world and we'd love to see you and to hear from you.
[04:43] And if you are in a company, starting a company, try and do the 1% pledge.
[04:49] Try and figure out your own version of the two-step plan and try and build products.
[04:54] And in every decision that you make that actually makes the world that you want to live in.
[04:58] I think there's this kind of belief sometimes that the world is created by other people,
[05:03] but we all have a very active hand in creating the world that we live in.
[05:07] And every decision that you make, for investors, every company that you fund, is that contributing
[05:13] the world to the world that you want to live in?
[05:16] Or is it creating the freight train that none of us want to be on?
[05:20] I have to ask before I let you go, are you going to have the rap dancers at the next
[05:24] Canva event?
[05:25] You'll have to wait and see.
[05:27] Melanie, thank you so much for being here.
[05:31] Thank you so much, Lenny, for having me.
[05:32] And you're great, well-researched questions.
[05:34] Thank you.
