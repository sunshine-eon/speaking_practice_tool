============================================================

[00:00] it. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?
[00:04] Let's do it. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?
[00:10] The first one is, is this book here? So several short sentences about writing.
[00:15] Do you know this book? I love that book. I have it on my, on my coffee table.
[00:18] When anyone ever asked me like, what book do you recommend on writing? It's this one.
[00:22] Several short sentences about writing. Yeah. I can never pronounce his last name,
[00:26] but Verne Klinkenborg, I believe, is his name, although I might be bastardizing that.
[00:31] But it's an extraordinarily good book about writing and it's all about the sentence.
[00:37] Beautifully written, fun to read, really great. The other one is pretty much anything by Derek
[00:42] Sievers, but specifically Hell Yeah or No. This book is something I recommend this book to
[00:48] everybody. It's really had a big effect on me and David specifically. And we talk, we use this,
[00:52] this term Hell Yeah or No all the time internally. Is this a Hell Yeah or No? It really clarifies a
[00:59] lot of things. And the last one is this design book, which is, which is interesting. There's
[01:05] a few different versions of it. The one I have handy. It's called Homemade Contemporary Russian
[01:10] Folk Artifacts. And what this book is, it's a collection of, it's a beautiful book. It's
[01:15] very simple. Basically, every spread is a person, a story, and a thing that they had to make
[01:22] because they didn't have anything. They couldn't get, they couldn't buy what they needed. They
[01:28] didn't have what they needed. So this example here is a guy put a hole in a spoon to make like
[01:34] bubbles for his kid, like to blow bubbles, like large bubbles, right? This is a TV antenna
[01:40] made out of forks, you know? And it's just like getting back to the scrappiness.
[01:47] Like, I admire this kind of ingenuity over pretty much anything. And I think that this
[01:53] book is full. There's a couple hundred pages. They have another couple, a couple different
[01:57] editions of this, but I love this one a lot. Look at this one. This guy had to make a door
[02:02] handle. I mean, in America, we're like, go get a door handle at Home Depot. Like,
[02:05] this guy didn't have a door handle. So he made it out of like a plastic, looks like a gallon,
[02:09] like oil can or some water thing and, you know, nailed it to a book which nailed it
[02:15] to a door, you know? Amazing. And this is also why I've always loved, I know this isn't
[02:19] very lightning, sorry, but I've always loved like looking at like jailhouse creations and
[02:26] tools and like, you know, how people make, you know, weapons out of combs and pens.
[02:30] It's just, I find this like, I have nothing. I need something. I can use my human brain
[02:37] to figure out how to make it. I think that scrappiness is beautiful.
[02:40] Yeah, I was just going to say it speaks clearly to your scrappy mentality.
[02:45] And what is that book called again? This one's called Homemade, Contemporary Russian Folk
[02:50] Artifacts. And there's also an Eastern European one and there's another one too, but Homemade.
[02:55] What an awesome unusual selection. Okay, next question. What is a favorite recent
[02:58] movie or TV show? I don't watch TV. I rarely get a chance to see movies these days. I
[03:04] really thoroughly enjoyed Oppenheimer though. I'm just, that was one of the, I mean, I went
[03:10] to the theater to see it and seeing that in the theater was really special, but I just
[03:15] loved the movie. It's fantastic. Do you have a favorite interview question that you'd like to
[03:19] ask candidates that you are interviewing to hire? Yeah, I think we kind of actually went over
[03:24] this one a little bit, which was, I'm always curious about like, what else, if you had
[03:27] more time, what would you do with this idea, you know? Another one is, you know,
[03:33] whose work do you admire? So it's not so much about what you can do, but what are other people
[03:36] doing that you think is great? I find that that really illuminates kind of, you know,
[03:42] what kind of pulse they have on the world and what they're looking at and what inspires them
[03:46] and what they think is good. So I like that question. In that second question,
[03:50] what do you look for? Is it like someone that you also admire? Ultimately, in the moment,
[03:54] I don't care who it is. It's more about, tell me why. Like, so someone will say like,
[03:59] I like so and so and like, why do you like them? What are they doing that you think is
[04:03] interesting? This is kind of the thing I tend to always ask, which is like,
[04:07] why do you think that that's interesting? I'm always trying to get behind the words
[04:12] and understand like where this is coming from because people can prepare answers
[04:19] and they can sound great, but it's like, well, what's behind that? Where are you
[04:22] going with that? Why? What's the genesis of this? That's sort of what I'm always after.
[04:27] And so, you know, whether or not I agree with the work or whatever,
[04:31] in the end, it kind of plays a part to some degree. But I'm more interested in like,
[04:36] how'd you get there? Is there a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really
[04:41] love? Yes, although it's more of a category. So I recently, I bought an old car and I've
[04:51] fallen back in love with stick shifts. You know, I learned how to stick and then I basically have
[04:56] had like automatic cars for many years and I got back into sticks. And now it's even deeper than
[05:02] that. I got back into the old analog driving experience and how wonderful it is to feel
[05:10] attached to the machine that you're using. That you turn the wheel and it turns it
[05:17] rod and it turns the wheels. And that your leg muscle actually is what is breaking the car,
[05:23] you know, to some degree, right? There's something about that direct feel that really
[05:28] surprised me. It surprised me like how much is missing in modern cars. And it actually,
[05:35] I like to draw these parallels because this is kind of how I see the world. It reminded
[05:39] me of our business actually. I think we've a very stick shift business. We're a very direct
[05:44] business. Everything's very, very tight, very straightforward. There are not a lot of layers
[05:49] of abstractions. There are not a lot of things in the middle between the work we do and the way it
[05:55] feels. And I think of large businesses as like automatic transmissions and modern cars where
[06:00] you just, everything's simulated. Like what does it feel? You don't really know what the road
[06:04] feels like. You can't really feel it in the steering wheel or maybe there's some
[06:07] fake feel in there now. The brakes are just like you're sending a command to a computer
[06:12] to squeeze the pads, you know. The transmission is like you don't control it. It just does its
[06:17] own thing. And there's a beauty in that too. But there's also a disconnect that I forgot about
[06:24] until I got back into driving the old car, which is like harder to drive and noisier and
[06:30] bumpier and creakier. But there's a real directness to it that's really special. And
[06:36] I think it's actually a good way to look at business and to remind yourself that
[06:42] staying as connected to the thing that you're doing as possible has a lot of value.
[06:48] That's an awesome metaphor. Next question. Do you have a favorite life model that you often
[06:53] repeat yourself, share with folks, find useful in work or in life?
[06:57] Yeah. And I don't always live up to it, but basically it's worry less.
[07:02] There's a great Tom Petty lyric. I can't remember which song it's in, but I think
[07:06] it's on Wild Flowers on the album. It's a, most of the things you worry about never
[07:10] happen anyway. And it's just so true. I find myself worrying about all sorts of things that
[07:16] don't matter and never happen. And then you're like, God, I spent like three days worrying
[07:20] about that or like, I went to this appointment and it was fine. Like the amount of worry
[07:25] and it's all on your head and it's all about anticipating the future that hasn't happened
[07:30] yet. And I try to tell myself that and I try to tell others that in business,
[07:34] I try to tell myself that in life and in business, but also I tell others that
[07:38] others that in business, like, what if people don't like, I don't know, you'll find out,
[07:43] like worry less about it. It probably isn't going to be a big deal anyway. So that's kind
[07:47] of what I would say. Worry less. Worry less.
[07:50] Final question. I was going to ask you this before you mentioned this, but you said you're
[07:54] writing a new book potentially. Are you able to share with us a new book might be about?
[07:59] Yeah, we haven't started writing it. I can tell you, I'm thinking about it.
[08:04] Right. And it's going to revolve around the idea of gut and intuition in business
[08:10] and decision making. I don't really know exactly how they all play in here in a book, but I think
[08:16] we need to celebrate gut and intuition more in business. And most business books are not about
[08:20] that. They're kind of about the opposite in many ways. You can't improve what you can't measure
[08:27] or whatever these things are. And I think that's true in a lot of realms like medicine
[08:31] and you can look at your biomarkers and you can do things.
[08:36] I don't think things are quite as direct in business. And I think that intuition and
[08:39] gut is something to be celebrated. So I think what we're probably going to end up doing is
[08:42] looking at all the ways we use intuition and gut to make decisions at work, whether it's
[08:45] hiring or product decisions or policy decisions or whatever it is, maybe break down some of
[08:49] those decisions in the past, perhaps, or talk about things on a day to day basis about
[08:54] how we employ those tools to move forward. So that's roughly the idea. It's very loose right now,
[09:03] but hopefully we can tighten it up. And that's what I'd love to focus on that next.
[09:06] That's an awesome topic for a book. I was thinking, worry less could also be an
[09:10] awesome title for a book, if that's another topic. That'd be a great title for a book.
[09:13] To go down. Yeah, that would be. Also, I was just, I'm reading Charlie Munger's,
[09:17] the poor Charlie Almanac right now. Beautiful. There's a whole thing around
[09:22] psych, the way we misjudge and make mistakes with our psychology, just like human misjudgment.
[09:27] Yeah, exactly. And I feel like that would be a part of this story, like gut instinct are often
[09:33] right, but here's ways that we are often wrong. So maybe that's something to think about.
[09:36] Yeah, it's funny. I had one opportunity to meet with Charlie Munger. It was on a Zoom call,
[09:42] and it was like four of us and we got an hour with him. This is a few years ago.
[09:46] And I only asked him one question. I was mostly just like a student,
[09:50] listening to other people's questions. I said, what's your take on doing something
[09:56] well that you know nothing about? Essentially, is there power in being completely ignorant
[10:02] about something? Because I didn't add this, but I've often found myself more creative
[10:11] when I don't know how to do something versus like, well, this is how you're supposed to
[10:14] do it. So you kind of fall into this pattern. And I really loved his answer,
[10:17] which was like, yeah, I would just trust your instinct on that, which is like,
[10:21] a lot of great things happen because you don't know how to do them. In fact,
[10:24] a lot of innovations happen because you don't know how other people do them.
[10:27] And all you have is your gut. All you have is your intuition. All you have is how you
[10:33] feel about the thing. You don't have evidence. You don't have other examples to follow.
[10:41] You don't have a list of what to do. You just kind of do. And I'm paraphrasing here,
[10:47] but it gave me a lot of confidence and hope to continue to follow our gut. And maybe this is
[10:54] ultimately in a way what was the seed for this book perhaps, although I hadn't really thought
[11:00] about that until now. But it's a beautiful thing to read and to listen to him speak. I love it.
[11:05] Jason, we covered everything I was hoping we'd cover. Thank you so much for making the
[11:10] time for this. Two final questions. Folks who want to follow up and maybe ask more questions,
[11:14] how can they reach you if they can? And then how can listeners be useful to you?
[11:18] Yeah, so you can hit me up on X, Jason Freed, F-R-I-E-D. I'm on LinkedIn as well. And you
[11:25] can also email me directly just jason at hey, H-E-Y dot com. So hit me up there. How can people
[11:32] help me? I mean, if you like what we're doing, spread the word. We don't really spend any
[11:36] money on advertising and marketing. We've explored a little bit here and there,
[11:38] but most of our growth has been organic and it's just word of mouth. So if you like what
[11:42] we're doing, tell people about it because it really helped us out.
[11:45] Amazing. Jason, thank you so much for being here.
