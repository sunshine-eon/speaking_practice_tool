============================================================

And that's where we refer to the Keeper's Test, which is really just a mental framing to make sure we hold ourselves accountable for this. If I'm asking myself the question, if this person on my team came to me and said, "I'm leaving today, I have a different opportunity and I would like to take it," would I do everything I could to keep them at Netflix? If not, then I should be having that tough conversation about whether they should really be here. Are they in the right role? If I might be a little bit relieved if they said they were leaving, then that’s a signal. 

The reason the Keeper's Test and that question is useful is that no one wants to think that way. It's very hard to say to someone, "I think this isn't the right fit. I think you should move on from the company." So we have to introduce some of those reflections in order to encourage the behavior. We also want to get to a place where, when you're having that tough conversation, you aren't surprised by it. That is easier said than done. But you can only get to that conversation around, "I don't think Netflix and you are the right fit for one another," if you've been giving feedback along the way. 

In its most ideal state, it's a mutual observation in practice. It's not always that smooth; obviously, we are humans. But that all feeds on itself to ensure that we're really holding ourselves to what we say are our behavioral norms as part of the culture. 

How is that operationalized? Is it just a mental model that you should have in mind? Or is it something you go through every quarter as part of the performance review process? How does that actually operationalize at Netflix? It's definitely a mental model. When we talk to managers about what it means to be a manager at Netflix, it means you should be asking yourself this about the people on your team with some frequency. People ask me frequently, "Am I passing your keeper test?" So it becomes part of a regular manager-direct report one-on-one. 

It is just another way of saying, "Am I meeting your expectations? What's going well? What's not going well? How are you thinking about things?" That can sometimes be a very awkward conversation to have. In the middle of discussions about projects or deliverables, taking the time to step back and just say, "How am I doing?" can feel loaded sometimes. The Keeper's Test, while it feels like a very heavy concept, creates a lightness around being able to have that conversation regularly. 

We do operationalize it. A point that you made, I'll clarify: we don't have performance reviews. We don't have a practice that a lot of other companies do where we reflect on a rating of how things are going. We do have an annual cycle of 360 feedback where you request and receive feedback from many people, but it's not an input to some output. It's just for the value of the feedback and to make sure we're keeping that muscle. We also have an annual compensation cycle where we reflect on how people are doing. 

So you think about performance as part of both promotions and compensation. But in that way, it has to be part of the day-to-day and part of the operating rhythm because we don't create a process where that would come to the surface. 

Interesting. I didn't know that. So the idea there is just ongoing. The whole idea of no performance reviews is that we will give you ongoing, real-time feedback. We don't have to wait six months. I feel like people talk about this but very rarely do it. But that's how you guys operate, ideally. 

In practice, you have to keep reminding yourself this is our ideal because it's really easy to rely on the annual 360 cycle. All of a sudden, I might get about 300 pieces of feedback, and some of those things are on events that happened six months ago. I think, "Oh, I wish you had told me this at the time." That would have been more in line with living the Netflix culture. So we have to push ourselves to do it that way. If working well, it's very timely, direct feedback. The 360 cycle serves as an annual check-in to get the full picture, distill some themes, and tee it up for a conversation with my manager. 

When you talked about this example of someone asking you often, "Am I meeting your keeper test?" it makes me feel like someone is just super nervous. They're like, "Am I passing your keeper test?" It could create a culture of stress and worry, almost a Hunger Games mentality of competing and worrying that they might get fired any day. I'm guessing the solution to that is partly cultural. This is just the way we work. You don't need to stress all the time, but you may be let go if you're not meeting this keeper test. 

How do you avoid this constant worry that you might be fired any day and that you may not be hitting the bar? In my personal experience, I have felt a lot more at ease by having these conversations than by not having them. In many roles I've had, I haven't been sure how I was doing or what I could be doing better, and I didn't quite know how to get that information. That made me feel much more stressed or nervous than having it be part of the culture to have those conversations. 

The thing that can be nerve-wracking—and I feel it myself—is the high bar for excellence at Netflix. You're surrounded by amazing people, and that can feed a sense of, "Am I doing well enough compared to how everyone else is doing?" I know the bar is high, and for the most part, that can drive people in a good way. But it can also make people nervous. That's where I think it's helpful to know we expect to have these conversations so you can let your shoulders relax a little bit. 

Yes, the expectations are high, but my manager says I'm doing a great job, or they say I'm not doing a great job but provide concrete things I could do better. Knowing is better than not. In that sense, the culture combined with the conversations around performance hopefully takes a little bit of that stress out of it. I've certainly heard that without those conversations, people can be nervous. 

That's such a good point and such a good example. I feel like every company wants to have a high bar, have only high performers, and keep the bar really high for every person they hire.
