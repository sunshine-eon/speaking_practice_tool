============================================================

[00:00] Okay, so for people that don't know anything about what Duolingo Streaks are, can you just
[00:06] first give a brief explanation of what is Duolingo Streaks? What is this feature all about?
[00:10] Well, presumably people know Duolingo is a language learning app. The Duolingo Streak tracks
[00:16] currently, anyway, how many days in a row you've done a lesson. So you come to Duolingo,
[00:20] you do a lesson, your first lesson, you know, you'll start a streak, and then
[00:25] every consecutive day that you come, use the app, you'll extend your streak. And I
[00:28] should actually put an asterisk around how many days in a row because we also have built flexibility
[00:34] into the features. So we have these things called streak freezes. It's like insurance for your
[00:38] streak. So, you know, it's a pretty simple feature, you know, in theory. But over time, we've layered
[00:43] on challenges and goal setting and rewards and, you know, social features, you know,
[00:50] a lot of our notifications are tied to the streak. So pretty simple feature to understand,
[00:55] but it's been a really rich feature for us to build on top of.
[00:58] Some people might be hearing this be like, Duolingo Streaks, what's the big deal?
[01:02] There's other people that are like, holy shit, I want to learn everything I can possibly learn
[01:05] about Duolingo Streaks. So many companies are trying to copy what you've learned from this.
[01:08] Do people sense of the impact that this one feature has had on Duolingo's success and growth?
[01:14] This is, and this is not just the, you know, subjective retention PM talking,
[01:18] I think this is our biggest feature with the exception of the lessons. And I think it's
[01:22] actually worth, start that, like the streaks are a great engagement hack. I'm kind of the opinion
[01:27] that any team, you know, any app out there can introduce a streak. And if you figure it out,
[01:31] it probably works, you know, to retain users. But at the core, like, you have to have an app
[01:36] that people want to use. And people really like using Duolingo. It's fun. It's delightful.
[01:40] You learn something. And so it allows us to layer an engagement mechanic on top of that,
[01:44] like the streak is really powerful. So it ships a disgusting amount of DAUs. Again,
[01:50] it is just, it is, it is our one of our golden geese. And again, what's cool is that like,
[01:56] you know, you look at notifications, notifications for Duolingo is massive. I mean, you know, us
[02:01] sending better, you know, whether it's copy or timing, so many of our notifications work
[02:07] because they reference the streak because users care about the streak. And so
[02:11] not only is it itself, us iterating on the streak, a huge driver of DAUs, but it's also
[02:17] something that enables other really high, you know, valuable features. I was looking up some stats
[02:22] before I came on. And it's pretty crazy. So we have right now over nine million users
[02:28] with a year plus streak. So nine million of our users have had used Duolingo
[02:35] every year, almost every day for, you know, well over a year, which, which is pretty,
[02:41] which is, I don't know, it's, I like to imagine things in terms of like, you know,
[02:46] okay, well, like if you put all these people in a city or, you know, in a place where it would be
[02:49] and like, ah, it's like a very large city, nine million people. So
[02:53] for a year have been have a year long streak. That's incredible. I was just looking at the
[02:59] stock of Duolingo. So Duolingo is a $14 billion company at the time of recording this. It's
[03:04] hitting all time highs too. It's like just keeps going up. I think it doubled
[03:07] in value in the past six months, something like that. And what I'm hearing from you is
[03:11] streaks is this other than just like the core learning feature, which is just like the
[03:16] product of Duolingo. This is the most impactful feature in terms of growth and in that retention
[03:22] specifically. I mean, if you look at the numbers, I think pretty objectively has been
[03:27] our biggest growth lover for, for driving DUs and also say a lot of it's just related to
[03:32] how we think about growth at Duolingo. And a lot of what we try to do is organic
[03:36] growth. You know, we think about growth, you know, just as much as bringing new users onto
[03:41] the platform is not losing them. If you're just bringing people onto the platform and they churn,
[03:45] that's not going to be sustainable. And so as much as we can do to keep our users coming back
[03:50] and actually retaining as users, it's going to make it, it's going to give us a much
[03:54] easier base to continue growing DUs off of. Perfect. Okay.
