Okay. So let's talk about this a little bit more. This aim-heavy concept, this idea of thinking 100 years out, is really important. Can you share more about that insight and philosophy? I know it sounds like it comes from Toby and how he likes to think about the business.

Totally. This is all Toby, really making sure Shopify is oriented around the idea that we are here to build a 100-year company. The decisions we're going to make are really focused on the long-term success of merchants and Shopify. Embedded in all of our principles are the goals to make the best product in the world and to make money to do more of that. We never reverse these principles. Every town hall, that slide comes up, and if you get a Shopify, you've probably seen that slide 10,000 times. But it's an important reminder that our job is to build the best product for merchants over the long term. All of the metrics and the money-making part of it are secondary to that. 

We care about that long-term piece. It ties back to the original conversation about entrepreneurs being the core of why we want more people to start businesses. It's very seductive, I think, in most companies, including Shopify, because we can support large enterprise businesses today. Big brands want to get off outdated solutions and come over to Shopify. It's easy to say, "Oh, that's very concrete. There's an existing business. We want them to join Shopify." In the short term, it feels great because it brings a lot of revenue right away. 

But if you're thinking about the long term, 100 years from now, guess what? All of the big brands of today will be out of business in 30, 40, or 50 years. The real success of Shopify is getting every business to start with us and grow. Making that type of investment and focusing on the entrepreneur segment is how we build a very long-term oriented company. Even how we do capital investment and product decision-making comes back to the idea that we can't chase short-term, even more concrete things.

Is there an example that comes to mind where you did that? Where something short term looked like, "Oh, we should definitely do this," but we're thinking long term, we're thinking 100 years out, so we're going to approach it this way?

It's very much imbued in the culture. Almost everything feels that way. Practically speaking, every six weeks, all the R&D group leads get together with Toby and each other to review every single project across the company. In that conversation, so much of the discussion revolves around the technical aspects—how are we building this in a way that allows Shopify to have optionality in the technical decisions we are making? 

I've learned from Toby that the "how," the technical architecture, determines strategy in a technology company even more than the "what" and "who" we're building for. If you build the right kind of technical foundation and set yourself up to have a platform that can be adaptable and flexible, that is incredibly valuable over the long term. It means we will sometimes take longer to ship a feature and may not chase certain deals, but we're making that investment. It comes through in all of our reviews and how we work together.

Wow, that is really unique. I've not heard of that approach where the "how" is prioritized. Usually, it's the opposite—let's not worry about how we're going to build this thing; it's about why we're building it and when. But here, the architecture is the most important thing.

Absolutely. In our last meeting, we had a 30-minute discussion about how to build CSD importers for people migrating from different platforms. It was all about whether we use an open-source library, do it internally, or build a separate first-party app. The technical detail of how we're going to do this was incredibly important to get right and set up this type of structure. Most companies would just say, "Okay, you're going to make it easier for people to migrate their data over. Cool, team, go figure out the how." But here, we work on it with Toby, and the details matter because the "how" is so important for building for the future.

That's fascinating. Usually, the focus is on how to do this as quickly as possible because CVS importing is not our core differentiator. Let's just build something good enough, ship it, and move on.

Totally. It's the opposite here, which is fascinating. It reminds me of Brian Chesky at Airbnb, where I worked for a while. He also had this idea of a 100-year vision and thinking far into the future. But interestingly, since he's a designer, he had a very different focus. Toby, being an engineer, still codes, which I can see on Twitter, so I understand why his brain goes there and why he's strong in the "how."

Brian, on the other hand, is very focused on the experience, making sure the design is amazing and that the app feels exactly how he wants it to. It's very experience-oriented. It's interesting how these founders lean into what they're strong at and understand deeply, which ideally connects with how their business specifically wins and grows. For a platform like Shopify, I can see why engineering would be essential to get right, while for travel and hospitality, like Airbnb, design is crucial.
