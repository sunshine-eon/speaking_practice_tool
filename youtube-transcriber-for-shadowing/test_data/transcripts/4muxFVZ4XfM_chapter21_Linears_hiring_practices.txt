============================================================

[00:00] Okay, so let's talk about hiring. As with most areas, you're very, very, very deliberate about
[00:05] hiring. The bar is so insanely high at linear and you also hire very few people. So just a few
[00:12] questions along these lines. Just one is when you're hiring people, what do you look for that
[00:17] you think maybe other people are not looking for enough? And where do you spend a lot of time?
[00:22] I think one of the things we all of us founders kind of saw in this high growth
[00:26] companies that sometimes like the high growth is like, especially on the employee side, it's not that
[00:31] great. It can create a lot of kind of chaos or just messiness or which is generally like in my
[00:39] his past on working in companies, it's almost never, it was always easier to work with a smaller team,
[00:45] very high quality people than with a very large team of like more average people. So like almost
[00:51] like it's always faster and better output when you have like more much smaller team.
[00:56] So that was kind of like the thing with linear too is like we just believe that
[01:00] you can actually build better with less people than you can with more people. So that's like this
[01:04] is the basic belief we have. So then when it goes to hiring, we've been like taking very like
[01:10] kind of like slow steps on it that like in the almost like the first year, we didn't hire
[01:15] anyone. Then like the second year, we hire like couple people and then the second year,
[01:19] we hired more few more. We never top more than doubled in a year. And that's kind of like
[01:24] you know, our guideline that like we shouldn't more than double. And this might be something we
[01:29] change in the future that we actually might do less than that. But like what we look into hiring
[01:34] it's like a couple of things like one is also that it obviously depends on the role.
[01:41] But basically, I would say like every with every role we often talk about like the
[01:46] there needs to be some taste or some like this kind of understanding of the
[01:51] like how things are done or how what's the like people have more like a broader perspective than
[01:57] like whatever their role is. So like we talked about the engineering before that like they
[02:03] do need to do some of this BM type of stuff. And so what we look for in them like is that like
[02:09] they have some of this like skill set or product thinking or they can articulate why some some
[02:14] choices are better than some others or like in their past like did they disagree with some
[02:18] of the company's choices or the team's choices or like so we want to have this like
[02:24] obviously they need to be good developers but also like do they have this like a product
[02:29] sensibility or or can do they have like a judgment around that. And this goes similar to like
[02:36] like for example like a marketing hire is like we we think about like yeah we do need the
[02:40] marketing skill sets. But then we also want to see that this person also like like maybe
[02:46] it's a good storyteller or like they have like this like kind of appreciation for for writing
[02:52] or stories or like they have a taste of what's what's like interesting and what's not. So I think
[02:59] like with or like when we hire like operations person we also like to see that they they maybe
[03:04] like have understanding on HR and maybe it's not their role but they understand it. And
[03:09] what happens is like when you have these people that are
[03:12] a little bit more than their title it's like the company is I think much more
[03:19] easier to manage because it's like people can like pick up things more easily or they can like
[03:24] work together more easily because everyone has more like a like a more like a shared
[03:28] areas or or it's not like it's not you rarely get to the point like people say like it's not
[03:33] my job it's it's more like people understand okay yeah I'm I'm kind of in operations but
[03:39] today I kind of need to help on this HR thing so which is okay. And so that's kind of like what
[03:45] we look for people it's like they are more than they're they can take more scope than their skillset
[03:53] would assume or like what normally is expected from them. So essentially you're looking for
[03:59] kind of these Venn diagram overlappings across different functions and teammates.
[04:03] Yeah and then I think it's the other thing is like I said before it's like we want to build much I think
[04:09] like a company that has less employees which means that it's like like I said before we don't want
[04:17] that many like specialized roles or like two specific areas of ownership or something we just
[04:23] think that we could build this like we could have less people and those people can take on
[04:30] more scope and they can own more scope. I think like traditionally I feel like in companies like
[04:35] how do you get more scope is that you advance in the levels of the company because there's like a
[04:40] lot of different teams and different levels and then to get any kind of scope you need to like
[04:44] rise in into this like higher levels. And what we try to do is like you don't actually you
[04:50] don't have to have that many levels but like people can just like already when they when they
[04:55] start they can start like owning more areas and I think that can be like much more like
[05:00] also like interesting not to everyone but like I think interesting to many people
[05:04] and it's kind of like how I also like always felt about as being a designer is like I don't
[05:09] I didn't feel like my job is purely like just looking at the designs I also thought like I
[05:15] actually need to be helping this business or helping this other area as well so I think it's
[05:20] just kind of like also like natural to me.
