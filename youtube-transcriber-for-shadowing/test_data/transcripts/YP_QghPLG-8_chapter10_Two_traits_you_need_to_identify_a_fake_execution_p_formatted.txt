============================================================

I noticed two things that made the organization busy. One is that they had imposed very high optics requirements, which meant they had to do a lot of optics-related work, show up at certain status meetings, and so on. We talked about that, so let's leave that aside for now. The other reason they were so overwhelmed is that they were constantly solving execution problems. They would solve the most important ones, but then new ones would arise, and they would solve those, leading to a classic game of whack-a-mole.

As I observed this, I thought of a concrete example where a seemingly execution problem surfaces. Imagine two teams that are misaligned and need to work together, but everyone knows that this misalignment is affecting our execution. It impacts our ability to hit our OKRs and theirs as well. As a leader, say you are a director of product or a VP of product responsible for one of these teams; you are now charged with fixing this execution problem so we can move faster. You might hold a dozen meetings to diagnose the issue and determine how to better align the teams.

After discussions with your peers on the other side, you might decide to create a new review process to regularly review priorities across the two teams. Additionally, you would have the managers of these individual teams conduct regular one-on-ones to stay in sync. This type of scenario is extremely common, especially in high-growth organizations that want to accomplish a lot. After many meetings and conversations, you come up with this solution.

As I grew as a leader, I became increasingly curious about these situations. Upon closer examination, I started realizing that what looked like an execution problem—this misalignment causing execution issues—was often not an execution problem at all. Instead, it was frequently a strategy problem. The reason for the misalignment was often that the teams were pursuing different strategies or, more commonly, they didn’t know what the strategy was. We would craft OKRs based on what seemed sensible, but they would not be well aligned, and we lacked a sense of priorities or a plan for when reality changed.

This lack of strategy was the root cause of the misalignment, not the frequency of meetings. In these meetings, discussions often devolve into minutiae, such as whether one team can work on a specific feature that another team depends on, or whether engineers can be swapped between teams. PMs are familiar with these small discussions, but nobody recognizes that the underlying issue is not being addressed.

As I continued to observe, I found that sometimes it was not a strategy problem but a culture problem. In situations where two teams are misaligned, a culture problem arises when the organization has set a culture that primarily optimizes for OKRs. In such a culture, it becomes challenging for two teams to collaborate effectively. If one team fails to hit their OKRs because they were helping another team, that team’s manager risks negative consequences in their performance review. This creates a culture problem that cannot be solved merely by setting up meetings or requesting syncs between teams.

Additionally, interpersonal problems can also contribute to misalignment. It is common for two team managers to not get along, creating friction that hinders collaboration. As a leader, it is crucial to identify these interpersonal issues and coach the individuals involved so they can work better together. Once you address these underlying issues, the need for frequent review meetings and other syncs diminishes because the teams will be able to collaborate effectively.

This is just one concrete example of team misalignment, which is often misidentified as an execution problem. There are signs that indicate whether our dates are slipping or if people are surprised by execution problems. Are there signs that suggest it might be one of these other factors? In my experience, it is often the case that these other issues are at play.

That said, there are indeed problems that are genuinely execution problems. For instance, if you have infrastructure issues—like outdated systems that cannot support the current usage—that will lead to execution problems such as slower performance or outages. Another example of a true execution problem is a skills gap, where engineers lack the necessary skills for a specific technology or where a PM is more suited for zero-to-one initiatives but is now responsible for a mature initiative.

In high-performing organizations that are growing rapidly, we often overlook these other factors. A surefire way to identify whether something is a true execution problem or not is to observe if a temporary solution fails. Many organizations find themselves repeatedly solving the same problem, such as teams struggling to collaborate or one team consistently being slow. When a bandaid solution is applied but fails, it indicates that the underlying issue remains unaddressed.

Organizations tend to have surprisingly short memories, forgetting that a solution was previously implemented and no longer works. Instead, they approach the situation as if they need a new solution, leading to the creation of yet another meeting. This is where honesty and memory become crucial; recognizing that a bandaid was applied but the problem persists suggests that it is likely not an execution issue.
