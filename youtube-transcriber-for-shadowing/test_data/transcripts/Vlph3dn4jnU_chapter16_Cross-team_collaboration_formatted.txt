============================================================

Drive growth, hit these goals. How do you collaborate across these two teams? Do you have a model for how you work together? Because these feel like very different ways of working.

Honestly, it's been one of the things I'm very proud of. We built a really great partnership over the last three and a half years because it's intentionally meant to be almost at odds. And that's part of the structure of how you want to work. But it comes from, I think, a place of respect on both sides. I don't say for anyone, "Okay, here's what growth is going to do." We're going to do it in a way that is high quality, that is shipping really good stuff for merchants. We're probably going to approach it in a faster way. We might disagree on things, but we're going to have reasonable paths to kind of handle that conflict.

A lot of it's no magic bullet. It wasn't like, "These are the surfaces that growth can touch. These are not." It's like, you can go anywhere in the product, but let's go figure out how to work together to figure out that quality bar, to understand when you're going to be different on it, on the quality bar to get something out to learn. Just building trust along the way that we're actually going to ship high-quality things when we ship it to 100% and move. So a lot of great work on the team to make those relationships really strong.

Got it. So basically, you guys are like, "Moving this button over here is going to drive so much growth." And then Glenn's like, "No, this is not acceptable. We don't want a button here. This looks terrible. Everyone's going to hate it." So that's the healthy tension I'm describing.

That's healthy tension, yeah, totally. It's like, "Okay, so how are we going to work to figure this out?" It might be, "Hey, we're going to move the button. Let's run that test. Let's see the short-term list. You know, we're going to monitor it long-term. When we ship it, it's going to be high quality, like high-quality polish." Okay. Do you trust us to make those trade-offs? I wish I had a better answer of like, it's very human, right? And it's very that trust. That's very important. Any of these, I think growth with other teams is like, there's no replacement for that human trust. Following through on commitments of, "No, we're actually going to make this thing really good."

Is there an example of that that comes to mind where you had something that you thought was going to drive meaningful growth? You showed it to Glenn, and he's like, "No, I don't know about this." And then either you iterated or you just like forgot it because this isn't right for the platform, even though it's going to drive some meaningful growth?

The place that we often come back to is, and this is with, you know, I think Toby is great. Toby and Glenn is on Wizards. So Wizards are onboarding carousels. Onboarding carousels are some way that basically has folks get set up by not using the actual product. We've always kind of danced around and we have a very specific no-wizard principle. But I think that sometimes the tension is Wizards can serve a purpose in certain circumstances. We've avoided doing that, but we've always worked to try to make the principles of what a wizard does really well, which is it simplifies the product into something that allows people to have a lower bar to try to work with core to bring that into the actual experience itself.

So the example of that experiment I mentioned to you of giving pre-filled sections in the online store editor, you could have solved that in a wizardy way of like, "Enter a few things and we're going to generate these sections for you." Instead, we actually took those pre-generated things based on what we know about you and put it into the actual product experience itself. So it tried to get at some of the principles of what a wizard can do well without avoiding the wizard principle without creating an actual wizard. That's been some of the ways we work together to get the intent of what the growth idea has been in a way that's consistent with how we want to build in core.

Got it. And I get why you think about this a lot because you talked about one of the biggest levers is onboarding and helping more people get to activate it. I could see why you spent a lot of time thinking about how do we help more people succeed there. Yes.
