Chapter 23: Lightning round
Video: Mastering product strategy and growing as a PM | Maggie Crowley (Toast, Drift, TripAdvisor)
Time: 75:17 - 82:33
============================================================

[00:00] Okay, well with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.
[00:03] Are you ready?
[00:04] I'm ready.
[00:05] Maggie, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?
[00:10] First, most common one is probably the presentation secrets of Steve Jobs.
[00:14] It's a little tiny one.
[00:16] Really great way to improve your speaking skills and your presentation skills and
[00:22] to get distracted executives to agree with the point you're making.
[00:28] So that's one.
[00:30] Thinking in Bets by Annie Duke is the second one.
[00:33] I'm coming back to the point about being able to make bets.
[00:36] I think that one's a really interesting one.
[00:38] And then bonus third one.
[00:40] This is more like a desk reference that I now have on my desk.
[00:44] The Scaling People book by Claire Hughes Johnson.
[00:47] I really enjoyed the way that one is working and it just sits on my desk.
[00:50] And I reference it every once in a while, especially as manager.
[00:53] I have it both under my laptop right where I'm sitting and then also way behind there.
[00:58] And it's one of the most popular episodes I've done with Claire.
[01:00] So if folks haven't listened to that one, highly recommend.
[01:03] She's incredible.
[01:04] Great choice.
[01:06] What is a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?
[01:10] Okay, so my husband is in the industry, as we say, here in LA.
[01:14] And so we watch a lot of good and bad shows and TV.
[01:18] But I think my favorite one that I've watched recently was Slow Horses.
[01:22] Gary Oldman is incredible.
[01:24] Highly recommend.
[01:26] Well, I haven't heard that one yet.
[01:27] Good tip.
[01:29] What is a favorite interview question you really like to ask,
[01:31] which I think you already gave away, but let's touch on it again.
[01:34] Yeah, it is what is the worst product that you've ever shipped?
[01:38] I think the best answers are ones, and I don't even care if someone listens to this
[01:42] and then I do this in an interview.
[01:44] People immediately laugh a little bit.
[01:47] They remember the horrible thing they did
[01:48] and then they share that horrible thing with you.
[01:51] And it tells me, you know, you have some humor.
[01:57] You're humble and you can point out when you've made a mistake, right?
[02:00] You've done enough to be able to confidently say,
[02:03] like, of course I've made a mistake because none of us are perfect.
[02:06] And you know how to spot those mistakes and you can learn from them.
[02:09] And I've always found that those conversations are the most interesting.
[02:12] What is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really like?
[02:16] One, because I've seen you on Twitter, you're a future fit guy.
[02:19] Yeah, I am.
[02:20] Three times a week?
[02:21] Yes, I was also a future fit person.
[02:24] Love, I think it's great.
[02:25] It's a great product.
[02:26] I'm now on ladder fit and personally, I love not being.
[02:34] I don't have to talk to the coach every day.
[02:35] I don't need the accountability.
[02:36] So like, that's not a thing that I needed as an ex-athlete.
[02:39] So for me, that didn't serve me.
[02:41] And this is I like the anonymity of it.
[02:43] And it comes with a totally unhinged group chat for your whole team.
[02:48] It's fantastic.
[02:49] I'm really enjoying it.
[02:50] Sweet.
[02:51] So that's one more of a funny one.
[02:52] And the second one, not to like get real niche, but I think good products
[02:56] are products that are focused.
[02:58] They do one thing incredibly well and they're not to your point about
[03:03] side quests or snow side quests.
[03:05] I'm a new mom.
[03:06] There's this app called Pumplog.
[03:09] I have never seen it execute so well on one problem.
[03:14] There's not a single thing where I think, oh, I wish it did this.
[03:17] It does it.
[03:18] It's like, I paid $14 for it.
[03:20] I've never paid for an app like that in my life.
[03:23] OK.
[03:23] I'm downloading it right after we finish.
[03:26] Do you have a favorite life motto that you either repeat yourself often,
[03:30] like to share with folks, find useful and just kind of living life?
[03:33] I'm sure there's mottos.
[03:34] I could say they would be aspirational mottos.
[03:37] But the real one is like, if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well.
[03:42] And, again, from being in sports to going to school,
[03:47] to being in product, in my opinion, if you're going to do something,
[03:53] do it to the best of your ability, because that's what you do with your day.
[03:56] You spend so much time working, like you may as well be good at it
[03:58] or trying to get good at it.
[04:00] And that's always how I've lived my life.
[04:03] I so love that message.
[04:04] I always think about that.
[04:07] Final question, you are an Olympic speed skater,
[04:10] which I don't think people would know necessarily that's insane.
[04:15] My question is, is there some bad speed skating
[04:17] that would surprise people that would be like, what?
[04:20] Oh, that is one I've never been asked before.
[04:25] The whole experience I've learned, obviously learned a ton from it.
[04:28] And I think what might surprise people about being a small sport athlete
[04:32] is that you have to think in four or eight year chunks.
[04:37] And so it's one of those things where you grind for so long in like a dark corner
[04:44] and then, you know, you get a chance to come, you know, sort of get the light to shine on you.
[04:49] And you learn how to love the process.
[04:52] And especially for speed skating, I was a long track speed skater.
[04:55] It's a 400 meter rink.
[04:57] You just are always turning left and going in a circle.
[05:00] Like there's not a lot going on.
[05:02] It's just you and your thoughts.
[05:04] And you just really, really learn how to get good at perfecting something over and over again.
[05:09] And you learn how to grind, you learn how to focus.
[05:11] And I think it's also cool you get to go super fast.
[05:15] But yeah, I don't know if that would surprise people about about speed skating.
[05:18] But I think just about being a small sport athlete,
[05:21] it's really about like years and years and years of toiling and silence
[05:25] to get maybe maybe one shot at something great.
[05:29] So much of what you just said would apply 100 percent to product management.
[05:33] And I love that, Maggie, you are awesome.
[05:36] Two final questions, working folks finding online if they want to reach out
[05:39] and maybe ask you any follow up questions and then two, how can listeners be useful to you?
[05:44] You can find me on Twitter for sure.
[05:47] I linked in, but just being a cringe, like I just can't get into the LinkedIn posting.
[05:52] LinkedIn's gotten better.
[05:52] I'd give it a shot.
[05:53] It's like actually pretty interesting now.
[05:56] Yeah, I'm thinking about it.
[05:59] I go back to work in a couple of weeks.
[06:01] And thinking about LinkedIn.
[06:03] But yeah, Twitter for sure, LinkedIn for sure.
[06:06] And I've always tried to be helpful to other people.
[06:09] So I don't have an answer for how people can be helpful to me.
[06:11] And my goal is really to share what I've been doing, the rooms that I get to be
[06:16] and the access to the content and the people and the learning that I've had.
[06:19] So hopefully I can find ways to keep sharing that.
[06:22] Maybe check out toast and use toast when they're at restaurants.
[06:25] Oh, yes, plug toast, come work with us.
[06:29] We're the best.
[06:30] I get to work with John Cutler.
[06:31] It's phenomenal.
[06:33] Legendary previous guest.
[06:34] Are there roles you're hiring for just for folks that are listening and just
[06:37] like, hey, maybe I should go do that.
[06:38] There are always roles that are open.
[06:40] I don't know what the most open roles are right now, but yeah, check it out.
[06:43] It's a great place.
[06:43] We'll link to the careers page.
[06:46] Awesome.
[06:46] Thank you again so much for being here.
[06:48] Thank you, Annie.
[06:49] It was awesome.
[06:50] Bye, everyone.
