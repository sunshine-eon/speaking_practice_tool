============================================================

[00:00] does do the opposite. Yeah. Okay. Another, maybe a last topic, I know that you guys are
[00:05] starting to move into the enterprise. When people think of superhuman, they think of
[00:08] just, you know, it's like consumer, it's like for people. And you guys are doing a lot of
[00:13] work to make it a B2B enterprise product. Four founders maybe that are starting to think
[00:18] about this transitioning from PLG to sales led and B2B enterprise. What, what have you
[00:24] learned about just what it takes to get to that point and just what does that sales motion
[00:28] look like for you guys? In some ways, it's very like selling to prosumers, except these
[00:35] users are not coming from Gmail where prosumers would normally come from. They're coming from
[00:39] Outlook. And Outlook users have very different expectations to Gmail users. For example,
[00:45] Outlook users expect their email app to also be a fully featured calendar app. Whereas
[00:52] Gmail users are happy with those two things being entirely different. So as a result,
[00:59] we've invested in calendar very heavily and we continue to do so. And there's, there's
[01:05] only so much I can say that, but it's pretty exciting. Outlook users, yeah, Outlook users
[01:11] are also used to certain safeguards. Like if you've used Outlook in an enterprise, warnings
[01:16] when a recipient is external to your domain or what Outlook users might know as sensitivity
[01:23] labels. And as a result, we've built support for external recipient indicators and sensitivity
[01:28] labels. But in some ways, it's very different to selling to prosumers because there are other
[01:33] stakeholders involved. For example, we've built support for enterprise mobile management
[01:39] by implementing Microsoft Intune. We recently sold one of the big three strategy consulting
[01:46] firms, which is super exciting. I can't say which one, but they love superhuman and they
[01:52] have thousands of people internally using superhuman. But we, and this is after a year,
[01:58] they've been piloting for a year and then accelerating over the last few months. We
[02:03] only just got them the mobile app, believe it or not, because as an enterprise like that,
[02:11] there are significant controls on what a allowed compliant mobile app can cannot do. For example,
[02:20] IT needs to be able to control which apps can save attachments or which apps you can copy and
[02:26] paste text into from email. And for many enterprises, those controls are super important.
[02:33] Wow. Okay. So it sounds like essentially just building all these features that large companies
[02:38] need is kind of the road you're on right now.
[02:41] Exactly. And there's two stakeholders. There's the users, which are actually quite different
[02:45] because they're Outlook users. And calendar is one of the main ways that manifests. And there's a
[02:49] whole bunch of other stakeholders. IT is one of them. But there are others as well. For example,
[02:54] companies this large have workplace management groups who want to see analytics of how people are
[02:59] working, how they can make their teams more efficient. And so it truly is a multi-threaded
[03:05] sale with multiple stakeholders.
[03:07] We had a linear on the the head of product from linear on the podcast, non and he actually, I
[03:11] don't know if you heard that episode, but he talks about how the how they decide what to prioritize,
[03:15] the thing they never build is middle managers needing to track how their reports are doing and
[03:21] things like that. So that's an interesting opportunity for you guys maybe to cut stuff. I
[03:26] don't know. Anyway, I want to end on
