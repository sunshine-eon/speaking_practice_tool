Video: Superhuman's secret to success | Rahul Vohra (CEO and founder)
Time: 00:00 - 05:00
============================================================

Let's talk about product market fit. You have to deliberately not act on the feedback of many of your early users. At the same time, you need to listen to people intensely and build what they want. That's what we're here to do: make something that people want. But it can't be all people. The question becomes, how do you listen to them? And of what they say, what do you pay attention to and what don't you?

The trick here is that you're not doing what a lot of CEOs think they need to be doing with their time. Many CEOs believe they need to spend time on hiring or building. Instead, you should intentionally spend time on product and marketing design. This is a technique that I call the switch lock. It's born out of the observation that your calendar reflects what you thought you were going to do, but it's really only your trail of work that describes what you actually did. How can we capture that?

I came up with the following idea: what if I just did whatever the heck I wanted with the most pivotal moment in my career? In my life, I learned the real secret behind morality. There is no such thing as a truly viral product. So, what then is the true secret?

Today, my guest is Rahul Vora. Rahul is the founder and CEO of Superhuman and one of the most thoughtful, insightful, and articulate founders that I've met. As you'll see in our conversation, it's hard not to be captivated by Rahul's storytelling skills and his really insightful takes on how to build great products and teams.

This episode is for anyone who's looking to build their product taste, help their teams move faster, learn how to think better from first principles, and also learn about Superhuman's very unique approach to building their company. This includes why they manually onboarded every single new user for years, why they decided to stop, and why they ignored most of their customer feedback on their way to finding product market fit. 

We'll also discuss how you can use his approach to finding product market fit for your own company, the power of game design in building great products, a very contrarian take on pricing strategy, and what Rahul has learned about building scalable products on top of AI and LLMs, and so much more.

This episode is brought to you by Epo. Epo is a next-generation AB testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Muro, ClickUp, and DraftKings rely on Epo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features. Epo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous, deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does.

When I was at Airbnb, one of the things I missed most was our experimentation platform, where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Epo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you save weeks off experiment time, an accessible UI for diving deeper into performance, and out-of-the-box reporting that helps you avoid annoying, prolonged analytic cycles. 

Epo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the AB testing flywheel. Epo powers experimentation across every use case, including product, growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing.
