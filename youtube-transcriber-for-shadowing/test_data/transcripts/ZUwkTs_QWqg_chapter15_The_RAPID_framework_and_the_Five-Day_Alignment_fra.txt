============================================================

[38:07] to make sure that the ecosystem can run.
[38:10] Let's talk about these two processes.
[38:12] Rapid and what was the other one?
[38:13] Five-day?
[38:14] Yeah, five-day alignment.
[38:15] They've both been around LinkedIn for a little bit,
[38:17] but they're great.
[38:17] The Rapid is just a question of,
[38:19] oftentimes to your point,
[38:20] if you're running two, three marketplaces,
[38:22] several different business model here,
[38:24] there's a question of who has the decision,
[38:25] who can make the decision in this situation.
[38:27] And so making sure that you have a single person's name
[38:30] with the decision, and that person is,
[38:32] you know, that is really, really important
[38:34] because it gets a clarity real fast.
[38:36] I mean, it's more of a personal rule,
[38:37] but kind of one thing I love to say is,
[38:40] if you had three back and forths in an email,
[38:41] you got to pick up the phone,
[38:42] and if you've been on the phone for 20 minutes,
[38:44] it's time to just write that decision maker and go.
[38:47] And that way you can make sure,
[38:48] the concept of an hour,
[38:49] you should be able to get a decision.
[38:51] It doesn't always operate like that.
[38:52] I'm sure there's many PMs at LinkedIn
[38:53] who are operating, who may have some feedback from me on that,
[38:56] but that's kind of the intent behind it.
[38:58] And then a five-day alignment is, you know,
[39:00] you should hold your managers accountable
[39:03] that in five days, if someone has something
[39:04] that they haven't been able to escalate and solve,
[39:06] that's probably then on the next level of person.
[39:08] But as you run that ecosystem,
[39:10] there's so much complexity around it,
[39:12] I think you need some of those processes in place
[39:14] in order to start answering some of those typewreckers,
[39:17] if you will.
[39:18] I like that five-day rule.
[39:19] Basically puts the clock on a manager
[39:21] to unblock, basically.
[39:23] Yeah, yeah.
[39:25] And with Rapid, I don't know if I totally understand,
[39:27] is that an acronym for something
[39:28] or is it just make decisions rapidly?
[39:31] No, it's a great question.
[39:32] The D stands for decisions,
[39:33] but the R is for who's recommending it,
[39:35] the A at Berman has to agree,
[39:37] the I is for other people who may be able
[39:39] to be putting in an input.
[39:41] And so it's basically a list of people
[39:43] who need to be in the decision chain.
[39:44] Got it.
[39:45] I would argue the most important thing
[39:46] is to have a single name on that decision line
[39:48] because that usually makes sure
[39:49] that you can get a decision very quickly.
