There's also this cool down period after one of these, what do you call these, a sprint or what's the term for it? No, I hate that term. I don't like the word sprint because how do you feel after a sprint? Exhausted? But also pretty good, you know? You can. Yeah. Yeah. It's funny because I was a sprinter in high school, so I love sprinting. But if you go all out, you might feel high for a minute, but you can't go all out again. You've got to like, you know, really catch your breath.

I certainly remember like my track coach, who actually ran in college for a year until he realized that wasn't good enough. He made us run 2200s in a row with just like two minutes break in between. The 200 is an incredibly hard race; you're all out for 200 meters or yards. And like after the fifth one, I just threw up. That's kind of what work is for a lot of people—like 2200s. They have these sprints, and they never seem to end. It's one sprint after the other, after the other, after the other. 

That's why I don't like the word because you can't layer that back to back to back to back. You cannot sprint back to back to back to back in life, and you can't do it at work. I mean, people do it at work, but like, I don't think it actually works. So what we do is after our six-week cycles, we typically take what we call a two-week cool down. We call these cycles, not sprints. 

A two-week cool down. We call them cycles because cycles happen again and again and again. Sprints start and end, but cycles happen like there's cycles in life and seasons. I like that idea that you're prepared for this thing to happen again. During the two-week cool down, that's when people can sort of internally freelance. They're still working, but they're kind of tightening up a couple of things. 

Maybe we just shipped or are working on a couple of extra days on something that didn't ship that's going to ship in two days, or kind of fixing some bugs and messing around with some stuff that they wanted to get to but no one ever had time for and was never scheduled. So that's kind of a good time to do that. In the meantime, a few of us are shaping up the next cycle's projects and finalizing that and writing the pitches up for that. 

So that's what those cycles are for. It's not that you're stopping work; it's that you're doing other kinds of work. And I think that's the important part versus back to back to back sprints of the same kind of work all the time.
