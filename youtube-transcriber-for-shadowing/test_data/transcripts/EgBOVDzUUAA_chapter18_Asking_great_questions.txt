============================================================

[00:00] I often wonder that if you took the most serious people and made their GPT searches public,
[00:07] a lot of people will learn because the problem of GPT is now it will make the people with
[00:13] great questions do well versus people who are looking for basic answers.
[00:18] So I think the world is going to be unfair to people who ask great questions.
[00:23] Interesting.
[00:24] Okay.
[00:25] Well, I got to ask you, is there any advice you have for asking great questions that
[00:29] has helped you in your work and career and life?
[00:33] Whenever somebody has many choices and they make the right choice in whatever domain they
[00:39] have.
[00:40] For example, let's say you could hire anybody, but you hired great people or let's say you
[00:44] could marry anybody, but you married a great person and so on and so forth.
[00:48] There are many choices to make.
[00:50] How do they make choices for that domain of expertise?
[00:56] And I think that is the most, and many times they cannot be, they're not going to explain
[01:00] how they make great choices.
[01:01] So it will really go in into that because they don't really have their mental models
[01:06] figured out.
[01:07] They cannot articulate.
[01:08] They cannot coach.
[01:09] They cannot explain.
[01:10] But if you can figure out a way how they make great decisions in general, in whatever
[01:13] domain of work that they are doing, you'll find many interesting insights coming
[01:18] over there.
[01:19] The other good questions to ask is about second order thinking, what do they
[01:25] think will happen to the world and why did they come to that conclusion?
[01:29] And you see that full chain of thoughts is very powerful.
[01:33] For example, second order thinking is known to be the most powerful trait to predict success
[01:39] of somebody.
[01:40] But I often wonder what happened in childhood of people who became great at second order
[01:47] thinking?
[01:48] And that question is not fully discovered or discussed yet.
[01:52] And I've found some loose examples of, did you play strategy games or only physical
[01:57] games as a strong correlation to building?
[02:00] So rigor came from physical games.
[02:02] But second order thinking came from playing strategy games as a kid.
[02:06] And if you had both, you could do really well in general because you have a discipline
[02:11] and second order thinking together.
[02:13] Then did you ever have an exercise on looking at history?
[02:19] For example, one of the things I recommend to parents to do with their kids, I call it
[02:25] the Wi-Fi school, is ask them a one why question every meal and let them come back with the
[02:31] answers next day.
[02:32] For example, why do humans wear jewelry and why is something in a certain way and
[02:41] let them go into the full depth of history and find out why it's so expensive to advertise
[02:50] and so on and so forth.
[02:51] You just take one question and if you train them on why they evolve at a very different
[02:57] rate because how what are the questions which do not evolve at a much higher rate because
[03:01] why is the deep question?
[03:03] And it breaks a lot of things in your head or another question about origin stories
[03:07] that how did elevators come into being and what made your phones happen, what made
[03:13] microphones happen and why is it called a microphone and why is it called a phone?
[03:17] And if you just want to go into this depth, you'll see people kind of build second order
[03:21] thinking automatically because either you go in history and see second order thinking
[03:25] coming of all of that or you play games that train your brain for second order thinking
[03:30] with the spectrum.
[03:32] But that's broad range of things that I think people should be asking.
[03:35] I'm looking forward to a Kunal children's raising book like a book to help you raise
[03:40] this.
[03:41] This could be your future.
[03:42] I don't have kids so I can run experiments on everybody else's kids so it's a great
[03:45] thing to do.
[03:47] And I feel like with these questions, I think the rule has to be you can't just ask chat
[03:50] GPT for the answer if the actually it's not bad.
[03:54] I think you should encourage it because we have to assume that we are going to be all
[03:57] co-pilots of AI now.
[04:00] What you have to do is derive the second order inside that okay, this is true where
[04:04] is the similarity of this in somewhere else like give me an example of this found
[04:09] somewhere else and so on and so forth.
