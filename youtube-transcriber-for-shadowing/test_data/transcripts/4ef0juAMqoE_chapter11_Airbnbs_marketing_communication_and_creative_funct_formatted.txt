============================================================

We also started really building out much more of a marketing communications and creative function. We built our own in-house creative agency. So we use production partners, but we don't use Widen and Kennedy or Scheiter anymore. We actually built our own in-house agency, so to speak, which is a creative group. The creative group does a lot of the, not just the ads, but the creative on the product. 

We got really, really functional. We got rid of a function called UX writing and combined it with marketing writing. We said, wait, aren't the best writers, like, why don't we just have the best writers do everything? Why is UX writing a separate function? Because actually the emails, the ads should all be one voice. Now, there may be people that come from a different background, like there are people that come from UX, but they all roll up to one function of writing. 

Writing should not go to design. Writing should go to a function called writing, unless you want your head of writing to report to design, then that doesn't make sense. So we really made a lot of those changes. 

Just to round up the question that you asked, I think that way too many founders apologize for how they want to run the company. I don't know why they do, but I think they apologize for how they run the company. They basically find some midpoint between how they want to run a company and how the people they lead want to run the company.
