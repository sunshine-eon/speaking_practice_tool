I want to ask your insight on this idea that people might be listening to this and feeling like, oh, we need to build a team that just builds great products and is not constrained by metrics and driving growth short-term, thinking long-term, thinking 100 years. This is inspiring, I think, to a lot of companies because it sounds great. What do you think it takes to make something like that work? 

In a bad case, this team just sits around and builds whatever they want, and the rest of the company is like, "God damn, this sucks. I have to show success in metrics, and moving a metric, and this team over there just builds beautiful things." Is it like you need a founder like Toby that prioritizes this and values it and has a really good taste and intuition? What do you think are important elements of something like that, of this approach working at a company based on what you've seen? 

I think it needs to have a very opinionated founder or set of people who are driving what it looks like. I think if it is, and I think Shopify, you know, a few years ago, maybe sometimes drifted into the mode of just building stuff, and each kind of team is just going to build stuff, not really accountable for it. That is a very, very bad state to end up. 

So I think you either have to use, my sense is metrics as accountability, which is the most common kind of way to drive accountability and focus, or an extremely strong founder or set of folks who have extremely strong opinions on what good is and what taste is. If you have one of those two, you can make it work. But the worst case is, let's just go build a bunch of cool stuff in a haphazard way that I don't think would work. 

Yeah, this is great. So either you need metrics to tell you you're doing the right thing or really correct and good taste in your founder. Correct. Cool. I think that's a really good way. And like, I imagine every founder is going to think, "Oh, that's me. I have this. I can do this." 

I think it's rare in real life. It's rare that you're like a Tobias, Brian Jeskier, or Elon. Yeah, he's just, you know, it's hard. It's hard to internalize that, but I think that's the reality. So most people will be more successful in building things that are driving metrics they can track in an experiment. 

Yes. Awesome. This is very fascinating. I'm so happy we're spending so much time on this.
