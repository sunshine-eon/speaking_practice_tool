It's easier to do that if you're the founder running the company, obviously. Is there something you find that you can do to help your teammates approach things that way too? Do you just trust their instincts also in a similar way? 

Yeah. I mean, you're right, by the way. It is, it's easy for me to sit up here and say this. Like, I own the place, no one can fire me, like, I get it, right? I can be wrong all the time, go, my God, just told me to do this. And, you know, I understand. I do, I'm self-aware enough to understand that. 

But I think that by demonstrating that's how we make decisions, it creates space for other people to make decisions that way. When we have conversations, you know, I'm talking with my team about something, I'll often go, I don't really know, it just feels like this, it feels this way. And they'll say, I feel this way. And I'll ask them, how do you feel? How do you feel? 

You know, what we ask people in general is like, we say, we say, what do you think? We don't say, what do you know? We often say, what do you think? We might say, what do you know? But we also say, what do you think more time. And what does that mean? Like, what do you think is, is like, I don't, I don't know where these thoughts come from. And I don't know what forms them. 

So I think it's interesting to look at the things we say and go, we actually do want people to think. And so I'll often say, what do you think or what do you feel? Or how does this feel is something we talk more about at work than pretty much anything else, which is like, how does this screen feel? How does this flow feel? How does this feature feel? How does this word feel? How does this sentence feel? How does this paragraph feel? How does this website feel? How do these colors feel? 

Because human beings feel. And while we have a logical side to us and a rational side to us, we're primarily feeling creatures, even if we don't admit it, we are. And so I'm always curious about that. So I bring that up a lot. And I ask other people how they feel. And I think, hopefully, that encourages people to share that side of their opinion. 

We almost never, sometimes we look at numbers to sort of be an input, but it's never like prove that. I'll never say like justify that. That's just not terminology or lingo that we ever bring up. It's not, it's not a way. It's how do you feel? It's not like, how certain are you? We don't, I try to tend to shy away from anything that's about certainty. We're not after certainty. I want to know how you think it feels. 

So anyway, I'm rambling again. But this is, I'm rambling because this is actually how things go. When we talk, there is a lot of this. It's not precise in a sense. It eventually becomes precise when it's out in the world. But the thought process is very rambling and very amorphous. And you kind of find your way as you go and eventually go, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it. That's it. That feels right.
