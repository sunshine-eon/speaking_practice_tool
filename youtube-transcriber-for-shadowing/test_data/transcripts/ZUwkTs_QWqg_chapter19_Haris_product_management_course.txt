Chapter 19: Hari’s product management course
Video: LinkedIn’s product evolution and the art of building complex systems | Hari Srinivasan (LinkedIn)
Time: 45:00 - 48:19
============================================================

[44:59] Makes a lot of sense.
[45:00] OK.
[45:01] And so within this, you have your own course
[45:03] on product management.
[45:05] Well, it's funny.
[45:05] So I mean, I've been thinking about a course for a while,
[45:08] but largely it was this concept of I
[45:12] wanted to make sure I tried our own product
[45:14] and I understood the instructor pain point.
[45:16] But it's a very scary experience.
[45:18] It's like, first, I don't know if I had anything to teach.
[45:20] I have concerns about that.
[45:22] But about four or five years ago,
[45:23] one of the things we started at PM internally
[45:26] was product university.
[45:28] We had our own internal university,
[45:30] which was basically we got some survey.
[45:31] We sent it down.
[45:32] I think everyone told us, well, it's literally like the most
[45:37] negative one was we didn't people
[45:38] said I don't have the skills to do my job.
[45:40] And I remember looking around, it's pretty obvious.
[45:42] We hired a bunch of people.
[45:43] There's no PM degree and we've done nothing.
[45:46] And so what we started doing is internally creating
[45:48] a product university.
[45:49] It was a boot camp coming in.
[45:50] We tried different models.
[45:52] And one of the things we really learned
[45:54] was you can't teach this just through frameworks.
[45:57] You needed to have a series of case studies.
[45:59] You needed to have a real serious examples.
[46:01] But luckily, we had a bunch of things we'd done at LinkedIn.
[46:03] So we started putting a curriculum against that.
[46:06] And then just recently, a few of us got together
[46:08] and we filmed the actual course for it.
[46:10] So it's basically taking our product university boot camp
[46:13] and kind of opening up to the world.
[46:14] And you opened up some of your internal use cases
[46:16] as a part of this course?
[46:17] We do.
[46:18] Yeah.
[46:18] That's awesome.
[46:19] I always say that one of the things you don't realize
[46:22] you have as an advantage working at a bigger company
[46:25] is access to tons of strategy documents and vision documents
[46:29] and stories of this.
[46:29] Because once you're out, no one's
[46:31] going to be able to share those with you
[46:32] because they're so private.
[46:33] I don't have access to any of these anymore.
[46:35] So that's a really cool perk of a working
[46:37] at a company like LinkedIn.
[46:38] Thanks.
[46:39] Yeah.
[46:40] Question about your course.
[46:41] What are some of your biggest lessons that you teach?
[46:43] Can you just give a preview of some of the tidbits
[46:46] that you might learn in this course of years?
[46:48] Well, again, a lot of it is case studies and use cases
[46:50] in the same way we teach it here.
[46:51] But a couple of things that we do talk through.
[46:54] When we started doing our own product university,
[46:56] we realized a couple of big pain points that people hit.
[46:59] The first was it's actually really hard
[47:01] to know how to validate and what the bar is for a new idea
[47:05] in any organization.
[47:06] I think it's really hard to say that.
[47:08] So we provide a lot of frameworks.
[47:09] So kind of simple things from, hey,
[47:12] you got to prove to the world why there's duct tape in here.
[47:16] There's someone actually physically going out
[47:17] and trying to do it.
[47:19] How you can prioritize a list of ideas against a pain point,
[47:22] like how to make a simple expression,
[47:24] and how to look through what's an acute pain point
[47:27] and what's a wide range of people use,
[47:29] how we'd expect data in order to be used
[47:31] in order to validate this.
[47:32] So kind of tools you could use to kind of say
[47:34] if this is a good idea or a bad idea,
[47:36] more importantly, tools to make sure you've
[47:37] went through the process and how you communicate it.
[47:39] That's kind of one framework set that we talk through.
[47:42] The other is a lot about Damien, who these are growth
[47:46] incomes, and he starts talking a lot about thinking
[47:49] in loops.
[47:49] And so how do you make sure that when you're building something,
[47:52] you can have the fuel in order to cascade and grow?
[47:54] And I think just the framework of doing that,
[47:56] how you measure that, how you monitor that,
[47:58] is also something that, at least when
[48:00] I was starting and doing my startup,
[48:01] it was quite something I wish I had access to.
[48:05] And so those are maybe two good examples of frameworks
[48:08] and tools that we come through.
[48:09] And then, of course, trying to overlay that with real cases,
[48:11] not always successful ones, of course, too.
[48:13] We talk about a lot of the failures we've had
[48:15] and where we probably went wrong if we
[48:17] had to diagnose them and post-mortem.
