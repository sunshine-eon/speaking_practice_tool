Dimitri, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Hi, Lenny, and happy to be here. As you know, I've been doing a bunch of research into which companies hire and create the best product managers. I've been triangulating this across a bunch of different data points. I've been looking at which companies' alumni product managers get promoted most when they leave the company, become chief product officers at the highest rate when they leave, become the first PM at a startup, and also start their own companies. When I triangulate it across all these different data points, there are three companies that stand out at the top: you guys, Revolut, Palantir, and Intercom. Clearly, you guys are doing something really special.

I don't think a lot of people, especially in the US, know a ton about Revolut. So I'm really excited to have you here. I'm eager to extract as much wisdom as I can from you about what you guys have figured out in hiring and training product managers. To start, I want to give people a slight understanding of what Revolut is. I think a lot of people in the US especially don't know much about it. So what's the simplest way to understand what you guys do?

Revolut challenges banks in 50 different countries. The toll started 10 years ago in London. To provide some context, especially for someone based in the US, it's important to understand that the European banking landscape is very diverse. In the US, if you travel from state to state, things are different, but you always pay in US dollars, right? In the UK, you pay in British pounds. If you travel to mainland Europe, you will pay in euros. If you go to Switzerland, you'll pay in Swiss francs, and if you go to Sweden, you'll pay in Swedish Krona, and so on. Overall, there are 25 different currencies. 

Every time you travel and pay in a different currency, banks were charging you exorbitant fees on top of terrible foreign exchange rates. That's when Revolut launched as a multi-currency card. People loved it. They loved that Revolut was saving them 50 or 100 euros, but even more so, they loved the transparency and simplicity of the product. That's why, when we started rolling out more and more products based on those principles, we quickly gained the trust of people and traction. That's how P2P transfers appeared, then frictionless crypto buying and withdrawal to a bank account, and then more and more products, including savings products and so on.

Awesome. Just to give people a sense of scale, how many employees are there roughly? I think the last valuation was something around 60 billion. I don't know if you can even comment on that, but what are some numbers for people to understand the scale of the company at this point?

The headcount is not something we're trying to increase, to be honest. Actually, Revolut tries to stay as lean as possible. But I think our appetite for growth is so big that we're currently at maybe 6,000 or 7,000 employees.
