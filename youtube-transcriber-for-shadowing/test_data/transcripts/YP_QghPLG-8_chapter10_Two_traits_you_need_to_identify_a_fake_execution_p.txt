============================================================

[00:00] I noticed two things that like what made them busy is two things.
[00:04] One is that somehow the organization had imposed very high optics requirements.
[00:10] So they had to do a lot of optics related work, show up at certain status meetings and blah, blah, blah.
[00:14] So we talked about that. So let's leave that aside.
[00:17] But the other reason they're so overwhelmed is that they are constantly solving execution problems.
[00:24] So they solve the most important ones, the new ones come up and they solve those and then there are two new ones to solve and on and on.
[00:33] Right? Like it's a classic whack-a-mole.
[00:35] And as I noticed that, and I'll share a concrete example of where this might happen, where an execution, a seemingly execution problem surfaces.
[00:45] So say two teams are misaligned.
[00:50] There's lack of they need to work together, but they're misaligned. Everybody knows it.
[00:54] And that is affecting our execution.
[00:57] That misalignment is affecting our execution.
[00:59] It's affecting our ability to hit ROKRs.
[01:02] It's affecting their ability to hit their ROKRs.
[01:05] So as a leader, say you're a director of product or VP of product responsible for one of these teams, you now are charged with fixing this execution problem so we can move faster.
[01:18] So you do a dozen beatings to figure out what's going on.
[01:22] You try to diagnose the issue, how to better align.
[01:25] And then you talk to, you know, your peers on the other side and then you decide, okay, here's what we're going to do to solve this execution problem.
[01:34] We are going to create a new review process.
[01:38] So we're going to create this process and we're going to review priorities on a regular basis across these two teams.
[01:44] And then we're going to also have the managers of these individual teams to do regular one-on-ones so they can stay in sync.
[01:51] Right?
[01:52] So this type of scenario is extremely common.
[01:55] Again, especially in high growth organizations that want to accomplish a lot, you'll come up with this solution after many meetings and a lot of work, a lot of conversation.
[02:05] And so as I grew as a leader, I got increasingly curious about this type of situation.
[02:11] And when I looked at it more closely, I started realizing that what looked like an execution problem, this misalignment and kind of causing execution issues, wasn't usually an execution problem.
[02:24] Instead, it was a strategy problem in some cases because the reason we are misaligned is because we are pursuing different strategies.
[02:35] Or like that is the more often the case is the reason we are misaligned is because we don't know what the strategy is.
[02:45] Right?
[02:46] So we don't know what the strategy is.
[02:48] We craft some OKRs based on what makes sense.
[02:51] The OKRs are not very well aligned.
[02:53] We don't have a sense of priorities.
[02:57] And we also don't have a sense of what we do when reality changes.
[03:01] This is all stuff that a strategy, a clear, correct strategy should help inform.
[03:08] But actually, like this lack of strategy is what's causing this misalignment.
[03:13] It's not because they are not meeting regularly.
[03:16] And what happens in these meetings is again, you're arguing the minutiae of like, well, are you going to work on this feature?
[03:21] I depend on this.
[03:22] Okay, new can you swap to engineers from this team?
[03:24] Like all of this stuff that PMs are very familiar with that you're talking about all the small stuff.
[03:29] But like nobody recognizes that like, oh, this like, can we fix that?
[03:34] Right?
[03:35] So as I started seeing this, like, you know, it often was a strategy problem.
[03:40] Sometimes it was not a strategy problem.
[03:42] It was a culture problem.
[03:44] So what is a culture problem in this situation where two teams are misaligned?
[03:49] It's basically that you have a problem where you have set a culture that you are supposed to mainly optimize for your OKRs, right?
[04:00] In a culture like that, it becomes really hard to allow two teams to work better together.
[04:09] Because if one of the teams doesn't hit their OKRs because they were helping rightly for the sake of the company, they were helping this other team,
[04:17] that team's manager is going to get his or her wrist lap at the next performance review.
[04:23] Right?
[04:24] So that is a culture problem.
[04:25] Now, yeah, you can set up the meeting and you can request all the sinks you want between these people.
[04:30] It's not going to solve the culture problem.
[04:32] It's going to be the execution problem is going to manifest in different ways, right?
[04:36] A month down the road.
[04:37] So that's like an example of a culture problem or it could be an interpersonal problem.
[04:43] Right?
[04:44] And this is actually quite common.
[04:45] It's simply that these two people cannot get along.
[04:47] The two team managers do not get along, right?
[04:50] And they just constantly might be creating friction, right?
[04:57] And so as a leader, it is important for you to spot that, right?
[05:01] And then coach them through their differences, coach one or both of them through that so that they can better work together.
[05:10] When you solve that, you won't need that monthly review meeting and all these sinks and 50 other things because they're not going to work anyway.
[05:17] So that's just one concrete example of like team misalignment, which is often viewed as an execution problem, but is not an execution problem.
[05:25] Are there signs that tell you, okay, where like our dates are slipping, people are surprised like of execution problems that you have.
[05:34] Like are there signs that maybe it's one of these other factors or is your experience like it's almost always one of these other things?
[05:41] So there are some problems that are truly execution problems.
[05:45] So an example of that is say you have infrastructure issues, right?
[05:52] Like your infrastructure is just like old and it cannot, can no longer sustain all the usage that you're getting.
[06:00] That will cause execution problems where you'll move slower or you will have outages or high latencies or whatever the case is.
[06:09] Yeah, that's an execution problem.
[06:11] Another such example of what is really an execution problem is you have a skills gap.
[06:18] You know, you have say engineers who are not particularly skilled in a certain technology or a certain type of scale that happened to be working in that area.
[06:32] Well, that is going to create execution issues, right?
[06:35] Or you have a PM who is more of a zero to one person, but now you made them responsible for this like scale mature initiative.
[06:43] So that's a skill gap and that can cause execution problems.
[06:47] Right. So there are very concrete instances where there is a real execution problem.
[06:52] It's just that in high performing organizations that are growing really fast, we ignore the other factors that might be at play.
[07:03] And so now what tells me if something is seemingly an execution problem, but not actually an execution problem?
[07:10] A sure-fire way of identifying those is when you put on a bandaid and the bandaid falls.
[07:16] So like the many organizations that are constantly just solving the same problem over and over again, right?
[07:21] Like, oh, we can never get along.
[07:23] Like we can never like get these two teams to work together, right?
[07:26] Like or like this team is always slow, right?
[07:29] And so you put the bandaid, but the bandaid doesn't work.
[07:32] An organization in memories tend to be surprisingly short.
[07:35] So we forget, you know, three months ago we put this bandaid and it's no longer working.
[07:40] We just approach it as, oh, let's create a new solution.
[07:43] So voila, there's a new meeting, right?
[07:45] And so that's where that honesty is important and memory is important.
[07:49] That no, no, no, this is a bandaid we put, but the problem still exists.
[07:53] So it's probably not an execution issue.
