============================================================

Okay, speaking of investors and other hard times, there's a very famous story about Canva. Early on, you pitched over 100 investors, and over 100 investors said no to you when you were just starting Canva. I think it's more than any founder I've talked to who actually tries to pitch. It's impressive. You tried that hard and went for so many pitches and finally got someone to take a bet. Now you're something like a $40 billion company making $3.3 billion ARR, with around $240 million monthly active users. One of the hottest private companies in the world. Just how does this feel?

I don't know. It was really clear in my mind that it was the future, and I thought the investors were wrong, frankly. But investors also gave really helpful feedback, often in the form of rejection. They would say, "Oh, your market's not big enough," and I would say, "It's going to be huge." I’d add a new page in my pitch deck that said how big the market, I believe, was. Then they'd say, "You're the same as some other company," and I would respond with, "Well, coupled with rejection," and I’d create a new slide showing all the players and the huge gap in the market that we believed we were going to fill.

Most investors knew absolutely nothing about design or the industry that we were in. So we ended up with the first few slides saying, "Here's the lay of the land today. Here's the problem that we're going to solve." While it was extraordinarily frustrating, their feedback made us stronger and made our pitch deck stronger. It was sort of like going from chaos to clarity. At the start, it was just this idea, and then through the copious amounts of rejection, the pitch deck got stronger and more refined.

I remember the first time I spoke to someone for hours, and they eventually got it. They were really committed to understanding what we were trying to do. But not everyone has six hours to understand a concept. So being able to take all the gems of wisdom from that conversation and have that understood really clearly in a short period of time, along with all the reasons that people were rejecting us pre-answered in that initial pitch deck, was really important. I think that's probably one of the reasons why, when I look back at our 2012 pitch deck, it's still valid and really captures what we're doing today.

In some ways, rejection makes you stronger if you can persist through it. However, I've never heard this part of the story. It's not just about persisting; it's actually about iterating and taking feedback to continue to evolve the pitch to a place where people finally get what you're doing. That is such a cool part of the story. How much did the product, like the vision and product, change throughout that journey versus just the way you pitched it and convinced people?

It was pretty consistent, but the way we articulated it changed greatly. For example, in the early days, I wouldn't articulate the problem very much. I focused on, like, "Here's the cool solution." So the first few pages became much more problem-based. If people don't understand the problem, then they can't understand or care about your solution. There was a lot of refinement in how it was articulated, but the actual vision itself, I think, was pretty consistent.
