============================================================

[00:00] When you're hiring people for your team,
[00:03] I'm curious what you look for
[00:05] and you think is incredibly important
[00:06] that maybe other people aren't just prioritizing as much?
[00:09] What do you focus on when you're hiring?
[00:11] Yeah, I mean, so everybody needs to have
[00:13] a certain set of technical skills.
[00:16] I think that's sort of a non-starter.
[00:18] You have a technical bar, we do a technical screen,
[00:20] so I think that's table stakes.
[00:23] There's some really unique characteristics
[00:25] that I've noticed when I look at some of the top talent
[00:28] that I've had on the team or have on the team.
[00:31] I think the first thing is just curiosity.
[00:34] You can't teach curiosity,
[00:36] or at least I haven't found a way to do it.
[00:39] If somebody else knows how, please let me know.
[00:41] Somebody who is just self-motivated
[00:43] to pull on the threads when they find them.
[00:46] So they don't just answer a question.
[00:48] They're like, hmm, this thing seems a little odd.
[00:51] I'm going to dig in and look,
[00:53] even though I could say I'm done,
[00:56] I answered the question.
[00:58] I did the thing I was going to do.
[00:59] The person that has that curiosity,
[01:01] something seems off, something doesn't really make sense,
[01:06] and goes and proactively looks into what that is.
[01:09] Like that is just so valuable.
[01:12] So I really look for that curiosity
[01:14] and that self-motivation to do it without being told.
[01:19] How do you test for that?
[01:20] How do you do that in an interview
[01:21] and get a sense of if they're good at that?
[01:23] One way you can do it through the questions you ask
[01:25] is have something that is not quite right
[01:29] within the case that you're presenting
[01:31] and see if people notice first and foremost.
[01:34] And even if they don't, if you point it out,
[01:38] where do they go with that?
[01:40] I think that that's something that you can test for.
[01:43] I think you can also ask for examples
[01:46] that for these folks typically will highlight this.
[01:52] They'll talk about, I noticed this thing
[01:54] and so we decided to investigate.
[01:57] So I think that there are ways that you can get it,
[02:02] get that signal through the interview process,
[02:05] but it's really hard.
[02:07] I think testing for hard skills
[02:10] is a lot easier than testing for soft skills.
[02:12] And I think in some of the questions we ask,
[02:15] we'll ask a question with the idea
[02:17] that we're assessing something separate
[02:20] than what the question is necessarily asking.
[02:22] And I think that this is one example
[02:25] of where that really works.
[02:27] You said that you give them a case.
[02:28] What does that look like?
[02:29] What is the actual kind of approach
[02:30] to how you do this interview?
[02:32] Our interview process has, in the early stages,
[02:36] a coding exercise.
[02:39] So we do our technical screen
[02:40] and a shortened version of a business case.
[02:44] So real world problem solving.
[02:46] Typically it's something actually
[02:48] from DoorDash history,
[02:50] like a real problem that we had
[02:53] to see how people can problem solve on the fly.
[02:57] I think that that's an important skill
[03:00] to be able to have,
[03:01] which is how do you take a problem,
[03:02] break it down, talk through it,
[03:05] a little bit like some of those consulting cases
[03:07] that you care about,
[03:09] but something that's really rooted in real problems.
[03:13] And I think you can learn a lot
[03:16] from those types of cases
[03:18] where, yes, you get to see how people handle ambiguity
[03:22] and structured problem solving.
[03:24] But ultimately, most people get something kind of wrong.
[03:28] They make an assumption that's wrong
[03:30] because, well, I would hope that the interviewer
[03:33] knows the business better than the interviewee.
[03:36] And seeing how people react to being told they're wrong
[03:39] is a really important signal, in my opinion.
[03:43] Seeing how people respond,
[03:46] how they're able to take new information and kind of pivot,
[03:50] how they're able to make a decision.
[03:52] So that's another thing that I like to see in cases
[03:54] where you may not know the real right decision.
[04:00] You might say, hey, I could see it going one way,
[04:03] I could see it going the other way,
[04:04] but I always push people to say,
[04:06] if you had to make a call right now, what would it be?
[04:08] So are people able to have a point of view
[04:11] without full information?
[04:13] Because that's life.
[04:14] Sometimes you have to just pick a direction
[04:18] and make a decision,
[04:19] even though you don't have perfect information.
[04:21] So I like to see some of these softer skills
[04:26] and how they manifest throughout a case interview,
[04:29] even if it's not specifically what I'm asking
[04:32] with the literal problem we're solving in the case.
