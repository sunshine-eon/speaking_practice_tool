============================================================

[00:00] This makes me think about this concept of an ugly baby from the book Creativity Inc.
[00:04] by I think Ed Catmull, where he talks about how new ideas are this ugly baby that nobody
[00:09] wants to look at and deal with.
[00:11] Like I think he says they want to kill.
[00:12] I don't know why you would do that with an ugly baby.
[00:15] But there are these like very soft, fragile things and it's really important to not kill
[00:22] them early and give them a chance to survive.
[00:24] And it's kind of what I'm hearing here is like, have this big vision that many people
[00:27] would be like, no, wait, this is completely absurd.
[00:31] And I love this idea.
[00:32] Okay.
[00:33] But here's like one step we could take there to see if this could be a thing.
[00:35] Yeah, I completely agree.
[00:37] And I think that's the thing is that that very first step at the very like far end of chaos,
[00:42] it's very embarrassing because you're like, I have this idea that is so big and so wild
[00:48] and how the hell would I do that?
[00:49] I have no idea.
[00:51] And so it's quite a embarrassing step actually because you don't have mastery at that point.
[00:56] You don't have all the answers.
[00:57] In fact, you have likely not none of the answers, but you just have the idea that you think
[01:02] would be cool.
[01:03] And ideally you get the idea that would be so cool that you want to work really hard
[01:07] to will that into existence.
[01:09] And so I think one of the really key parts is not only just having the idea, but thinking
[01:13] it's so cool that you're going to work for years to will into existence.
[01:17] Actually Melissa did a really amazing pitch deck recently about the vision of it.
[01:21] I won't go into the details right here, but the vision of her space.
[01:25] I was really excited about it.
[01:28] And so I think that that's the great thing about a pitch deck is that other people can
[01:32] see your thinking and your thinking actually gets clarified as well as you go through
[01:36] that process.
[01:37] I talked to Melissa, I talked to a bunch of other people that work at Canva that have
[01:39] worked at Canva.
[01:40] And something else I heard along these lines is this phrase, crazy big goals, which I think
[01:46] is one of your values, crazy big goals.
[01:48] I love that as a value.
[01:49] Why is that so important?
[01:50] How does that fit into this and just talk about them, the power of having crazy big goals?
[01:55] Yes.
[01:55] So right from the start of Canva, it was truly a crazy big goal.
[01:59] We're like, we want to empower the world to design and take all these things to a super
[02:03] complicated and put them into one platform and make it accessible to the whole world.
[02:07] And we want to rather than it be super expensive and unaffordable, we want to empower
[02:11] everyone everywhere in the world to design.
[02:14] So I mean, that was the epitome of a crazy big goal.
[02:17] And if we macro out even further, we've got this two step plan, build one of the world's
[02:20] most valuable companies and do the most good we can do.
[02:23] So again, a rather crazy big goal.
[02:27] And I think the thing that I love about a crazy big goal is that you feel completely
[02:32] inadequate before it.
[02:34] You know, another crazy big goal, we'd love to see everyone's basic human needs met on
[02:37] the planet, like completely crazy big.
[02:41] That truly shouldn't be.
[02:44] It's kind of absolutely absurd.
[02:45] That's the case, but we can go into that later.
[02:49] But I think with a crazy big goal, then you want to work really hard to will it into
[02:54] existence.
[02:55] And so if you start with a reasonable goal or a realistic goal, then you kind of get
[03:00] to get to it and you're like, oh, cool, whatever.
[03:02] Or more importantly, if something happens, you know, all the problems and roadblocks
[03:09] come along as they always do, then you're like, OK, I won't bother with that.
[03:13] And then you can just like go and choose another course.
[03:17] And so a crazy big goal is both crazy big, but it's also something that you think is
[03:21] incredibly important that you actually want to will into existence because it is so much
[03:26] work to will a crazy big goal into existence.
[03:29] So it better be one that you want to actually achieve.
[03:32] Is there a crazy big goal that you set that comes to mind maybe as a good example of this
[03:36] is what I'm talking about, maybe a product you launched or featured back in the day?
[03:40] Yeah, I mean, so many things.
[03:42] So we have a mission to empower the world to design and we break it down into mission
[03:46] pillars, so empower everyone to design anything with every ingredient in every
[03:50] language on every device, obviously a mouthful.
[03:53] But then what we do is we take successive goals every year towards this mission.
[03:57] And so for designing anything, we started off with social media and your presentations
[04:02] and now and like docs and websites and whiteboards and video.
[04:08] And so every year we're just launching more and more things to fulfill that part
[04:11] of the mission of empowering everyone to design anything.
[04:14] And then equally in every language, we started in English and then it was Spanish
[04:18] and then it was 20 languages and then a hundred languages and then hard languages
[04:22] like Arabic and Hebrew and Urdu and you're right to left languages.
[04:26] And now, you know, we're in 100 plus languages now and we're now we're really
[04:29] doubling down on the localization experience to make it feel truly local
[04:32] in every market around the world.
[04:34] And so you can see how having these very big audacious goals that you then just like
[04:39] take a step after step towards helps them will into existence.
[04:43] Or on every device, we started off obviously just with a web platform.
[04:47] And then we launched our iPad app and then iPhone and then Android.
[04:50] And then we spent years investing in cross platforms.
[04:53] So we have the same feature set across every device.
[04:55] And so you can see how these like big amorphous things that seem very outlandish.
[05:01] You can then just will into existence after a continual investment for a decade
[05:05] and it compounds over time.
[05:06] I see how all this is starting to fade together.
[05:08] There's this big crazy ambitious vision.
[05:11] And below there are the mission pillars that are feeding into this vision
[05:13] and then the crazy big goals within each of those mission pillars to measure
[05:16] your progress towards all these components of the mission.
[05:19] Exactly.
[05:20] Exactly.
[05:21] OK, so with all that in mind, there's also this kind of tradeoff you have to make
[05:25] of just how ambitious you get because oftentimes sometimes maybe you never miss
[05:29] the goal, but most many times people miss these very ambitious goals.
[05:32] How do you just find that balance between ambitious, crazy, but doable enough
[05:36] for people don't get discouraged?
[05:38] I think with a crazy big goal, the thing we have been really great at is
[05:43] achieving them.
[05:44] The time frame that we achieve them on has not always been very reliable.
[05:49] We have certainly not been able to have a pin dart.
[05:52] What's the...
[05:54] Acute.
[05:55] We have not been very accurate with timing, but it's really interesting.
[05:58] I look back at a 2021 vision deck that we made, obviously in 2021, but it was
[06:04] about 2026 and it was fascinating to see how much we'd actually been able to
[06:09] achieve from that vision deck and how many things were currently
[06:12] still in flight.
[06:14] And so by having that, I thought in 2021, some of those things may have
[06:18] happened a little quicker, but over the last five years, they've really
[06:23] been coming into reality.
[06:25] And so we might think things are going to take six months and then they take a
[06:28] year.
[06:28] We might think things are going to take six months and they take two years,
[06:31] as has been the case.
[06:33] We might think something's actually going to take our entire lifetime as some
[06:36] of those really, truly crazy big goals.
[06:38] And in fact, I don't even know if we can ever achieve them, frankly, but they're
[06:42] such an important goal that even if you make a little step in their direction,
[06:46] they're worthwhile nonetheless.
[06:48] Whether you like them or not, Elon, this is similar to his.
[06:51] If you watch him, he has sets these really ambitious goals and then often is
[06:54] far late on achieving them, but clearly it has worked out in achieving the
[06:59] crazy things that he's achieved.
[07:01] Something else I hear is you celebrate these goals in a really unique way to
[07:04] talk about that.
[07:05] So when we have these crazy big goals, we also have coupled them with
[07:10] really fun celebrations.
[07:11] And so we attempt to make the crazy big goals happen in a moment in time.
[07:15] So then when we achieve them, we actually have a really fun moment.
[07:18] Because if you're just trying to plug towards the top of the mountain always,
[07:21] and you never take a little moment to pet yourself on the back, it would feel a
[07:25] little arduous.
[07:26] And so over the years, we had all sorts of fun little celebrations where we
[07:32] have smashed Greek plates and released doves and had a little Latomiteen festival.
[07:37] And all sorts of fun things, just to take a moment with the team to celebrate
[07:42] that huge achievement.
[07:44] And so I think that you want to celebrate what you want to really focus on and
[07:50] what you want everyone to take that moment.
[07:52] So when you achieve that crazy big goal, when we launched in Spanish, when we
[07:55] hit 100 languages, and then the so forth across the company, taking that
[07:59] moment to actually pat yourself on the back and pat the teams on the back and
[08:03] say, hey, we did this thing.
[08:05] That thing that seemed really hard, we've now achieved.
[08:08] And the mission is often, each of the different mission pillars, they're
[08:12] obviously a long area of investment that's going to take a long time to get to.
[08:17] But being able to celebrate each of the rungs on that on the way there, I think
[08:21] is extraordinarily important.
[08:23] And then it makes everyone, everyone works extraordinarily hard to bring them to
[08:26] life.
[08:27] And then it gives everyone a little moment to feel proud of themselves.
[08:30] It'd be very motivating to get to just break a bunch of plates.
[08:32] I really like that.
[08:34] We need to bring that one back.
[08:35] We haven't done that in a while.
[08:37] It's a good one.
[08:38] I just love how concrete you're making this.
[08:40] So it's, you know, set these crazy big goals, find the component to the
[08:43] goals, set numbers there, and then figure out the kind of the steps you take to
[08:46] achieve these.
