============================================================

Four teams that want to try the sort of approach, especially startups that are kind of starting out and maybe not excited about hiring product managers. Is there anything else that you think is essential or important to functioning well without any product managers? And you're at around 50 people at this point? 

Yeah, we are around 15. Probably the only thing I would say is like the hiring front that you really need to spend more time on it. You cannot really interview engineers only for their engineering skills; you also have to interview them for their product skills. It’s obvious that you cannot expect people to have the same skill set or understanding of the concepts if you do some kind of BM interview for them. 

The way we've done it in the past is that I might interview them about the product. I'm not a technical person per se, so I will just ask them questions about how they did something or how they think about something. It’s similar for other roles too. We look for whether this person has opinions about products and how they work, if they can form opinions, and if they can use their own judgment at times. Additionally, can they communicate or articulate those things as well? 

Awesome. I was just thinking it's interesting that a tool that I don't think is designed specifically for product managers, but essentially for building products like the infrastructure for building product in a team, is built by a company that has one BM and very few PMs. 

Yeah, I mean, I think in some ways, with Linear, we're trying to help the whole company. I think engineers are probably the largest user group of the product. We want to make the BMs' jobs easier so they have to spend less time managing everything or the day-to-day. The engineers are actually using the product and updating things, so for the BMs, it would be much easier to get a sense of the state of things and maybe trust it more because people are actually using the product. 

In some ways, we're trying to make it easier for everyone. It allows engineers to focus more on their work, and for BMs, we want to enable them to focus on other things rather than managing the tool they use. I think that’s not the most important job of a PM. They should be thinking more about the bigger picture, other problems, or figuring out the next features.
