============================================================

It was March 2020, and we were just watching COVID hit. It was a heartbreaking moment as we saw people, by no fault of their own, starting to post about losing their jobs. In our data, we noticed that while some areas, like hospitality, were really getting hit, others, like customer service, couldn't hire enough. You would think the marketplace would balance pretty quickly, that people would start moving out of their jobs, but that wasn't happening. A large reason behind this was that people were used to looking for specific titles and didn't realize how others could do the same job.

So, we made a significant push in what we call skills-first hiring. This idea was that we could translate people's experiences into a set of skills. By doing this, we could help balance the marketplace with a much different system. I believe the job market is rebalancing, but the pathways are being created in a very different way. This change might hold through the ups and downs, and it'll be interesting to see how it evolves.

Welcome to Lenny's podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences in building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Hari Srinivasan. This episode has a hilarious story behind it. On Twitter, an account called the Curious PM tagged me with a request to have someone from LinkedIn come on the podcast and talk about how they operate and what they've learned about building products that serve various types of customers.

I replied, asking for suggestions on who I should specifically talk to, and he suggested Hari Srinivasan after doing some research on LinkedIn. I reached out to Hari, told him about the tweet, and he agreed to join. Hari has been at LinkedIn for eight and a half years, leading the talent solutions product team as VP of product, which is also LinkedIn's biggest business, including all the hiring and learning products you'll hear about in this episode.

In our chat, Hari shares what he's seeing change in the hiring market, what you can do to improve your odds of finding a job through LinkedIn, what he's learned about building and maintaining complex systems like LinkedIn, tips for getting into product management, and some lessons from his own course on product management. We also discuss how LinkedIn has become a real source of valuable content and a lot less cringe over the past couple of years, which I've definitely noticed and share in our conversation.

What a fun series of events that led to this episode! A big thank you to Jotun, hopefully pronouncing your name correctly, the guy behind the Curious PM account, for making this all happen. With that, I bring you Hari Srinivasan after a short word from our sponsors.

Today's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard designed specifically for teams like yours. The best way to see what Miro's all about and how it can help your team collaborate better is not to listen to me talk about it, but to check it out for yourself. Go to Miro.com slash Lenny. 

With the help of the Miro team, I created a super cool Miro board featuring two of my favorite templates: my one-pager template and my managing up template. You can plug and play and start using them immediately with your team. I've also embedded some of my favorite templates that others have published in the Miroverse. When you get to the board, you can leave suggestions for the podcast, answer a question I have for you, and generally just play around to get a sense of how it all works.

Miro is a killer tool for brainstorming with your team, laying out your strategy, sharing user research findings, capturing ideas, giving feedback on wireframes, and collaborating with your colleagues. I actually used Miro to collaborate with the Miro team on creating my own board, and it was super fun and easy. Go check it out at Miro.com slash Lenny. That's M-I-R-O.com slash Lenny.

Today's episode is also brought to you by Brave Search and their newest product, the Brave Search API, an independent global search index you can use to power your search or AI apps. If your work involves AI, you know how important new data is to train your LLMs and power your AI applications. You might be building an incredible AI product, but if you're using the same data sets as your competitors to train your models, you don't have much of an advantage.

Brave Search is the fastest-growing search engine since Bing, and it's 100% independent from the big tech companies. Its index features billions of pages of high-quality data from real humans and is constantly updated thanks to being the default search engine in the Brave browser. If you're building products with search capabilities, you're probably experiencing soaring API costs or a lack of viable global alternatives to Bing or Google. It's only going to become harder to afford these challenges.

The Brave Search API gives you access to its novel web-scale data with competitive features, intuitive structuring, and affordable costs. AI developers will particularly benefit from data containing thorough coverage of recent events. Lenny's podcast listeners can get started testing the API for free at brave.com slash Lenny. That's brave.com slash Lenny.
