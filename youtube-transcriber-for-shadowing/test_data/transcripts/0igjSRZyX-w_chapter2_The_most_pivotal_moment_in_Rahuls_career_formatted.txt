============================================================

Rahul, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Hello, hello, and thank you for having me, Lenny. I have so many questions for you. We're going to have so much to talk about. I actually want to start with your time before Superhuman. When I was preparing for this chat, I asked you what the most pivotal moment in your career and your life was. You told me that, other than starting Superhuman, it was selling your previous company, Reportive, to LinkedIn. So let me just start there. What was that experience like? What do people not know about this phase in your life, and why was it so pivotal?

For folks that don't know, Reportive was my last company. It was the first Gmail extension to scale to millions of users. Basically, on the right-hand side of Gmail, we would show you what people looked like, where they worked, links to their recent tweets, their LinkedIn profile, and everything else they were doing online. So if you were hiring, marketing, selling, or in business development, it was super useful. It turns out we somehow attracted most of LinkedIn's daily active users onto this one free app, and I ultimately ended up selling that to LinkedIn. 

That, by far, as you said, was the most pivotal thing I'd done in my career prior to starting Superhuman. Now, had I known that we'd amassed most of LinkedIn's active users onto one app, I would have sold it for far more. But the actual pivotal moment was really who I got to work with, because I reported to LinkedIn's head of growth, Elliot Schmuckler, who was responsible for scaling LinkedIn from 25 million members to, when I joined, north of 250 million members. 

During my first one-on-one, I learned the real secret behind virality. And big hint: it's not about viral mechanics. Overall, that acquisition experience gave me the time to figure out what was next and the resources to truly swing for the fences.
