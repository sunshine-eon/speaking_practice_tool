============================================================

[00:00] I'm curious, I know this could be its own podcast and book, but just in terms of hiring
[00:05] people that are amazing and keeping this bar of excellence.
[00:10] Is there anything you can point out that might be helpful to other companies hiring to help
[00:13] identify amazing people and make sure that bar stays high?
[00:17] One thing I know is you guys pay a top market for salary.
[00:20] I think that's one unique thing about Netflix is we just pay people.
[00:26] So maybe that's an answer part of this answer, but just what advice do you have for people
[00:29] to keep a really high bar in their talent?
[00:31] Yeah, I mean, on the compensation point, we pay what we call personal top of market, meaning
[00:39] we want to be highly competitive in the pay, but we don't want pay to be like the golden
[00:45] handcuffs of Netflix sets market rather than paying people a strongly competitive compensation.
[00:55] So I think that that's important for attracting and retaining talent and has been a big part
[01:03] of the culture, but almost more importantly, we hope we don't have to rely on that to want
[01:11] people to want to be at Netflix or for us to be able to assess whether people are going
[01:16] to thrive at Netflix.
[01:18] And the way that I've thought about hiring with that context is we know we're going to
[01:23] offer you very highly competitive compensation, but are you going to come to Netflix and help
[01:30] us identify the right problems to solve or new ways to solve existing problems?
[01:39] And that's a different way of hiring than you might think about, especially at scale
[01:45] where you're saying, does this person have this skill, this skill, this skill check,
[01:50] they're going to fit in this box and they're going to deliver this work that I need them
[01:53] to do.
[01:54] I'm being intentionally simplistic.
[01:57] I recognize a lot of people don't hire actually that way.
[02:00] But at Netflix, we try really hard to say we're looking for the new perspective or the
[02:04] person who's actually going to make us stronger as a team.
[02:08] So thinking about additive skills, additive perspectives, people who are going to push
[02:13] our thinking on something.
[02:15] And that tends to help us with thinking about talent density, because you're constantly
[02:21] introducing people to the team who up level.
[02:24] So then the questions you have to ask in an interview might be different because yes,
[02:28] we're trying to assess, do you have the baseline skills to be successful here?
[02:32] But we're also looking for the things that make people exceptional or even stronger than
[02:36] the team we've got.
[02:38] And then you think about making the magical teams comprised of all those amazing minds
[02:43] and what can you get out of that?
[02:45] And that feels like more that the talent density in practice.
[02:49] Got it.
[02:50] So the advice there essentially is don't look for someone just simply great.
[02:53] Look for someone that raises the bar for the whole team brings in a whole new perspective.
[02:57] Yeah.
[02:58] I think what's great about this idea of just maintaining excellence consistently is that
[03:04] the best people want to work with the best people.
[03:06] And as soon as there's one person that sucks and the company allows for that, it just brings
[03:10] everyone down because they know, hey, we can.
[03:13] We can be okay.
[03:14] We'll stick around.
[03:15] No one's going to do anything about it.
[03:16] And when you make it clear, we only want the best and only hire the best and we keep
[03:21] the best.
[03:22] It keeps the best there.
[03:24] Right?
[03:25] I imagine that's part of the strategy.
[03:28] It's definitely the goal.
[03:29] And I think understanding that having gaps in the team and people's skill sets or their
[03:35] behavior can be really toxic for other people on the team.
[03:39] So it's a cost.
