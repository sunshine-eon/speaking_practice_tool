============================================================

[00:00] That's what you've learned about how to pick good metrics and align incentives well.
[00:05] I've learned a lot of things about metrics, mostly from bad metrics.
[00:08] I actually think you learn a lot from picking the wrong metric.
[00:12] Ultimately, you want to find a short term metric you can measure that drives a long
[00:19] term output.
[00:21] People always talk about, oh, we want to drive an improvement in retention.
[00:25] Retention is a terrible thing to goal on because it's almost impossible to drive in a meaningful
[00:32] way in the short term, and yet you want to be able to experiment and iterate quickly.
[00:38] What are the things that drive retention?
[00:41] What are the inputs?
[00:42] I think it's really important to find the right inputs and then through experimentation
[00:46] test whether or not those short term inputs are driving the long term output that you're
[00:51] looking for.
[00:52] I think that's one thing.
[00:54] I think keeping things simple is another thing I've learned over the years.
[00:58] Maybe it's data scientists, but they tend to love these composite metrics.
[01:04] With a coefficient, we're going to weight this input at x and this input at x plus 2.
[01:11] Then you end up with a metric that nobody really understands that doesn't actually mean
[01:17] anything.
[01:18] You're like, I don't know if a 0.1 increase is a lot, is a good, is a bad, so they're just
[01:26] hard to work with.
[01:28] I always encourage folks, just pick something simple.
[01:31] Even if it's not perfect and your composite would be more perfect, if people understand
[01:36] it, if they have an intuition around it, if it's something that people can talk about
[01:41] across the company, it's going to be a much better metric in terms of driving
[01:45] real outcomes than your made up composite score that nobody understands.
