============================================================

[00:00] This actually is a good segue to something else that someone that you work with suggested ask you,
[00:05] Farhan, your head of engineering, asked him what's the best way to kind of get a glimpse
[00:09] into Toby's mind. And it's actually along the lines of what you just described, which is
[00:13] the question is just, what's the best way to disagree with you?
[00:16] I think just disagree with me. I immediately love it. Like, honestly, I actually,
[00:22] I really crave it. It's very funny because that really, I know how this like really
[00:28] surprises people. And I actually appreciate it even more because it requires courage. And
[00:35] frankly, I actually do find that. But it also makes me immediately trust the person more,
[00:40] partly because I first of all think they will do what they think is right rather than what is
[00:45] convenient. Agreeing with sort of a group is tends to be much more convenient.
[00:51] But more than that, actually, that they're courageous enough to do it in right then,
[00:55] right? Because like, I mean, I do find that I think courage is really, really rare. Like it's,
[01:02] I found more, I found a lot more high IQ in industry than courage. I found a lot more,
[01:12] maybe even genius than courage. So I like that. I wish I wouldn't require that. This is why
[01:18] I try to be very inviting of it. So when someone disagrees with me, I tend to immediately stop
[01:27] and say, cool, this is like, let's, let's, let's, let's figure out why there's disagreement.
[01:34] And it's almost never I find in the sort of, I just feel like we should do this differently.
[01:40] What I'm looking for is like offer unstated foundational assumptions. What is our divergence
[01:46] point? Because you might be right. In fact, people often are when it gets to this point.
[01:53] I found, you know, sometimes it's an unstated foundational assumption that I hold that is like
[02:02] incorrect. And then I, people tell me, and then I'm so glad we talked about it because
[02:06] I will stop forever nagging on this thing because now I know we can't do it because of,
[02:11] I mean, substance oxley or something like this. It is like, well, cool. I just, my, my, my mental
[02:16] model of substance oxley, which is like regulation for public companies is not perfect. And like,
[02:23] I have not in depth studied all the details for it. So I will not consult this in my mind
[02:29] when I am saying, Hey, we should, we should solve the task at hand in a certain way. So
[02:35] this is very good. So yeah, like how to disagree. I, I, you know, I really like,
[02:42] I really liked the bait. I will play devil's advocate actively, if everyone agrees on something
[02:49] and it again, especially if you have, if a proposal is something that feels like I could
[02:54] have predicted would be a proposal before I got into the meeting and there was nothing
[02:57] surprising in it. I will make myself sort of the end boss of the level and just say,
[03:04] like, okay, well, I'm going to say this is like, just not that good. Or so, you know,
[03:08] just like, I think, I think we could do way better. And I want people to then argue for
[03:14] more in depth for the veracity of the decisions. And that leads to a form of disagreement. I think
[03:19] all these things end up building trust. I like that that touches also on this idea of again,
[03:24] maximizing potential, the potential of the teams, the potential of the employees.
[03:28] Because of course, like the really important decisions we don't talk about, right?
[03:32] Because this is the most important thing, right? Like,
[03:34] Shopify probably makes what millions of decisions every day, like,
[03:39] write this code this way, like, yes, I'm going to add this unit test, maybe I'm skipping the
[03:44] unit test might be the difference between a future production outage, right? And
[03:50] millions and millions of tiny decisions. So you're not hiring engineers primarily
[03:56] or like, accountants you're hiring, people will make excellent decisions given their sort of
[04:02] specialization and overseeing. And given that decision making as a concept is actually like
[04:08] really understudied, I find. And so I think these instances where we can just
[04:19] learn to make decision making together. Because I think, while a lot of decisions are made
[04:26] independently, we are a product company. We are on a mission and we want our product
[04:33] to feel like something that a single person made, like in the same way how any author tries to
[04:39] write a book that clearly reads as that it came from one mind. Because people can see and spot
[04:45] this if this doesn't happen. It's like, you end up with something that looks like a television
[04:49] remote where like there's like a Netflix button over here. It's just like, it's like,
[04:52] you can sort of reverse workshop from the remote control. And so it's,
[05:00] like that's important. And so using these moments and also bringing decision making
[05:05] inwards to like go and say like, hey, let's have very efficient
[05:10] opportunities for as many people that can possibly get together, make decisions
[05:16] together, not as a democracy, but with clear who needs to convince who, but like that because
[05:22] otherwise this ends up being like just like taking way too long, but give opportunity for
[05:26] everyone to change my mind over Glenn's mind and so on. It's an excellent practice, I find.
[05:32] I think this is a more optimal way of going about it.
[05:36] Speaking of disagreeing, you reminded me of a story I heard about the Toby Tornado,
[05:39] actually the way you operate that. And I love it. It like ends up being this
[05:42] interesting microcosm of your first principle's way of thinking. So the story is, I think you've
[05:48] said at one point that the best way to get people to give you insights is to say something they
[05:55] disagree with on the internet. And that's often the way you approach this as you post in a Slack
[06:00] group, hey, I don't think this product is going to work. And here's why. And that ends up
[06:05] creating the most information for you. Is there anything on those lines that might be
[06:08] helpful to share? I mean, I don't think that's one of my better ways of doing that.
[06:12] It is extremely, I have to be somewhat careful. Like the people I work with a lot, I will do this
[06:17] just because it's funny. But like, I mean, even I can see that that would seriously stress out
[06:28] the interns. You guys have a lot of interns. I think you have a thousand interns in this
[06:32] coming years, but for Hansher. Yeah, we just started. I just I was in an office yesterday
[06:37] and it's like absolutely full of interns. It's great. Okay, love interns so much, Ennard.
