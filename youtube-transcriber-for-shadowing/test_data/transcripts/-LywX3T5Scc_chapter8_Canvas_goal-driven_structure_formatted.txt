============================================================

Is there anything else that is a good example of how you did something pretty different from how other companies operate? Anything else that comes to mind as a fun example?

The goal-driven structures, I think, the things that we were talking about before, so the mission, actually breaking that down into the mission pillars, breaking those mission pillars down into the goals that we're then pursuing, and then celebrating those goals when we do achieve them, I think is a deeply underloved way of building a company. 

Some people have a mission that's kind of on the wall somewhere, and then what they're actually doing and the way they actually make money, and the way that where people actually spend their time is in a very, very different direction from that original mission. I think the magic is when you can bring those two things together. 

You can have your mission, you can have your mission pillars that are actually helping to achieve that. I think there's a real authenticity in that for customers as well, is that you're actually doing the thing that you promised you do, and it all ladders up together. 

It's certainly not an easy way to run a company, but I think that when you do get that formula right, I think that there's a lot of authenticity with what you're saying.
