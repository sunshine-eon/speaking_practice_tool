Video: Brian Chesky’s new playbook

============================================================

[00:00] Now what we do is we do, we have a rolling two year roadmap.
[00:04] We don't even really do an annual plan.
[00:06] I mean, as you remember, Lanny, near ad Airbnb,
[00:09] we would have like three month planning cycles.
[00:12] Now planning cycle is just a budgeting cycle.
[00:15] And it's like most people only spend a week or two on it.
[00:18] Some don't spell any time on it.
[00:20] And we have a rolling two year product plan,
[00:23] the strategy, product strategy roadmap
[00:26] that gets updated every six months with releases.
[00:29] We release products every May and every November or October.
[00:33] Obviously we did one today we can talk about.
[00:36] The entire company works together.
[00:38] They row in the same direction.
[00:39] And the product management also does a product marketing.
[00:43] So they're figuring out how people are gonna learn about it.
[00:45] They're doing the demos.
[00:46] They're understanding the story, the videos.
[00:49] They're figuring out all the customer touch points,
[00:52] making sure everyone understands it.
[00:54] Our product marketing works with communications.
[00:57] We like work months ahead of time on all the different assets.
[01:00] And when we're working on a launch,
[01:02] one of the first things we'll do
[01:04] is start figuring out what the story is.
[01:06] And the story will often dictate the product
[01:08] because ultimately you have to tell the story to people.
[01:12] But a story also is a really helpful way
[01:15] to develop a cohesive product.
[01:17] We wanted a company where 1,000 people could work
[01:19] but it looked like 10 people did it.
[01:21] And so, sorry, that was a bit of a brain dumb,
[01:23] but that is a little bit of a universal theory
[01:28] for how we develop products now.
[01:30] I mean, I could go into a lot more detail,
[01:32] but I probably will stop there.
[01:34] That was amazing. You touched on all of the things
[01:36] I want to talk about, so I'm gonna...
[01:37] Oh, gee, so we can go deeper and deeper
[01:38] because the rabbit hole goes deeper. Yeah, exactly.
