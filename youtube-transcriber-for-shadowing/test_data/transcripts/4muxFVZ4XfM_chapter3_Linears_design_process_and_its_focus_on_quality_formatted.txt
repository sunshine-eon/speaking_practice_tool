============================================================

That is insane. I didn't even know that. Okay, so for all those reasons, a lot of founders and a lot of product leaders look up to the way you build product and the way you think about product. To kind of frame this conversation, there are three areas I want to dive into. One is just how you approach building product. Two is how you go about building the team and the business in general. And then three is just how you grow linear.

To start, I want to talk about craft. Clearly, one of the biggest reasons that people look up to Linear and use Linear is the quality of the user experience and the product. I know your team puts a lot of emphasis on craft and user experience. I imagine that also comes at the cost of some trade-offs. It probably takes longer to get stuff out the door, and you might be losing sales because people are waiting for a feature and you're not ready to launch yet because you want to make it better. What have you learned about creating space for craft and building a product that is really, really great?

Yeah, and I think it's interesting that those things we mentioned—like hiring, building business, and building product—are all somewhat related to each other. What I can say about product craft, per se, is that it definitely starts with the people. On the hiring front, we always look for people that care about it as a business. Why we really care about it is that we see that cooperation only happens if people use the product. Our product is supposed to help with core collaboration and coordination. If there's friction or if the experience isn't that great, or if there are little paper cuts, it gets really annoying for people to use. So we think that for the business to be successful, the quality and the craft are very important.

There are definitely trade-offs sometimes. For example, we might be about to launch something, and then I or someone else looks at it and thinks, "Oh, this doesn't feel right." We might decide that we shouldn't launch it now. Sometimes, this can push timelines, but it might only be by days. It's not like we need to redo everything. The other way we think about it is that we are actually very okay with pushing things out to ourselves and for a small group of customers who opt in. Whenever we build a new feature, one of the things we do is not spend tons of time upfront just designing it and polishing it perfectly. We believe that when you start building the thing, you actually start realizing more about how it should work and how it should be better.

So a lot of times, we tell the teams to just put it there. After you have some kind of designs in place or some design ideas, just put it into the app and ship it to production, but only make it visible to us. This way, we can internally test it out. The next stage is to look for a customer that could be interested in this feature, or we just ask people to opt into some kind of beta program. In those stages, the experience can be a little janky or not that polished, but we're okay with it because we are saying it's not finished. We just want to get your feedback early so we can make it better. But once we get to the full general release, then we pay more attention to the actual polish and the craft.

That is so interesting! I didn't know you do that. So you actually go ahead and launch things really early to a select group of people that want the early stuff. Did you say that you find one customer to kind of co-create and help evolve the feature and change with it?

Yeah, usually it can be one or it can be three, five, or ten. Especially with larger company-facing features, we usually try to find a large company because sometimes it's hard to imagine how these things should work. It's better if someone is willing to work with us to explain how they do something. For example, we worked with Versailles, and there were some changes they wanted to see in the roadmap feature. We worked with them to improve it, and they could give us feedback along the way.

That is so interesting because I think people seeing Linear from the outside feel like you just take the time you need to build something awesome, and then it launches, and it's amazing and great. But it turns out that isn't exactly how you build. You actually do launch things really early, and people don't necessarily see it until it's done, but there's this whole process behind the scenes.

Yeah, I think sometimes people can believe that craft is about perfecting things in a very organized way or very early on. The downside with this perfection mindset is that it can be hard to put anything out because nothing is ever fully perfect. So we try to balance this thinking with the fact that we should always be pushing things out very quickly, but then also fixing and improving them very quickly. It's almost like the opposite ideas, but we try to combine that, and I think it's been working well. Generally, in the company, there's not necessarily a lot of reviews. We want people to feel that they can put something in the app, and then we can try it out. It's more like, "Let's just try it out." But then, yes, we do need to look at it again before we release it to everyone.
