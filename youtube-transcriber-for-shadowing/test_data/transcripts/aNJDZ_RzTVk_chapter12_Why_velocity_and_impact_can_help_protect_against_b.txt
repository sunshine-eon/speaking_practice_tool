============================================================

[00:00] doing their work, how are they sustainably gonna last at ramp?
[00:04] I'm curious just what that's like
[00:05] and how you think about avoiding burnout
[00:06] for folks that are just constantly shipping, shipping, shipping.
[00:09] I think that the debate around working hard and burnout
[00:13] kind of misses a key point,
[00:14] which is all about how much impact
[00:18] and how good you feel about the work that you're doing.
[00:22] And I think that for me, when I felt burnout
[00:25] it was actually at the time
[00:27] where I had the lowest amount of velocity.
[00:30] It was when I felt like I was putting a lot of effort
[00:32] into things that weren't actually moving.
[00:35] And so I actually think velocity
[00:36] is a way to potentially avoid burnout.
[00:38] I'm not asking people to work, you know,
[00:41] unless hours a week.
[00:42] I'm asking people to get out of their own way
[00:44] and to focus on what truly matters,
[00:46] which is building great products for our customers.
[00:49] And I think you do that if you do that
[00:51] if you get into a flow state,
[00:53] if you get into a cadence where everything becomes easier,
[00:57] where work can really become thrilling.
[00:59] And I think sometimes organizations,
[01:02] especially as they grow, make that really hard.
[01:05] They make it really hard to just be in that flow state
[01:07] with a ton of distractions, a ton of meetings,
[01:10] a ton of cross-functional teams
[01:12] that are all asking for your attention
[01:14] and grabbing for attention.
[01:16] And another parallel of this is the running.
[01:19] The best runners are the ones that love running
[01:22] and they feel like running is immature,
[01:24] work is immature.
[01:25] And I think, you know, as a runner,
[01:27] I try to try to evaluate that
[01:29] whenever we're doing something hard,
[01:30] that's challenging, that's exhausting.
[01:33] If you love what you do,
[01:34] you feel much better about the amount of effort
[01:36] you're putting into it
[01:37] and work doesn't feel like work.
[01:39] I find the same thing.
[01:40] I find that when I think back
[01:41] to the times that had the best experience,
[01:44] the most fulfilling work that I've done,
[01:46] it's often I was working insane hours.
[01:49] It was just like this very long,
[01:51] stressful project, but looking back,
[01:54] you're always like, wow, that was so much,
[01:55] that was so cool.
[01:56] I learned so much, we shipped so much interesting stuff,
[01:59] made so much impact.
[02:00] I think the key is what you said
[02:01] is that you have to actually be proud of it
[02:03] and it has to be something that's meaningful to you
[02:05] because you could work long hours
[02:06] on something that you have no interest in
[02:09] and that does not help
[02:10] and that does lead to burnout.
[02:12] So that's the key.
[02:13] And you said something there
[02:15] which is like meaningful to you, right?
[02:17] So not meaningful to your boss
[02:18] or your boss's boss or your boss's brother,
[02:19] not meaningful to you.
[02:21] And I think that that's the role of management
[02:24] is to make everyone on your team feel like it's their goal.
[02:28] And the way to do that is to, again,
[02:32] align on that goal and give it to them
[02:34] and to problems to solve.
[02:35] If everyone feels like it's their team,
[02:39] it's their company, their mini company,
[02:41] then they will radically avoid burnout.
[02:43] But if they feel like the work is being pushed onto them,
[02:47] they feel like they're not aligned on the goal
[02:48] where they don't feel empowered with the solution,
[02:51] then the burnout will absolutely happen.
[02:53] One of my favorite quotes that you have shared
[02:55] is, any second you spend planning
[02:57] is a second you don't spend doing.
[03:00] And on the one hand, I love that
[03:02] because the more you...
