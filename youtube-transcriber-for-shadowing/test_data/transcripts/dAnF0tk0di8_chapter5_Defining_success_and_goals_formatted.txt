They're awesome. They're great. So around this idea of staying small, one is that small is not just a stepping stone; small is a great destination itself. Also, if you think you're too small to be effective, you've never been in bed with a mosquito. Now, that's not my quote, just to be clear. Okay, okay. You probably quote though. 

And then there's one more thing: you don't need to outdo the competition. It's expensive and defensive. Instead, underdo your competition. We need more simplicity and clarity. A lot of these ideas point to a few paths to success and goals for people. One path is to build a massively scaled product that everyone uses, like Figma or Notion, aiming for a venture-scale hundred billion dollar company. Then there's another path, which is focused on making a bunch of profit individually, taking home cash without trying to have everyone in the world use it. I know your focus is on what you call the fortune 5 million versus the fortune 500. 

So, maybe just share whatever you want about what success means to you and how you think about it for the company you're building. For me, it's really about whether I want to do this again. If the answer is yes, like, "That was enjoyable. I enjoyed that. That was worthwhile. I'm glad I did that. I'd like to do that again," then it was successful. 

Now, you could find some extremes there. Like, I'm sure someone who's addicted to drugs might say, "That felt great. I should do that again." So, you have to be careful with that. Addiction is a whole different story, but in general, with this kind of stuff, it’s about whether it was fun and whether we want to do it again. If something didn’t work or was a pain in the ass, too complicated, or took too long, then we decide not to do that again. 

So, at a root level, success for us is about whether we want to do it again. On the business side, we have to be profitable. That doesn’t mean everything we do needs to be profitable. I am not driven by data, nor do I have different P&Ls for each product that we look at very carefully. It’s more about whether, collectively, we are making more money than we spend. That’s the only thing we ultimately look at. 

Whether this product is more profitable than that product, or this is behind that, it’s all the things we do. I don’t even think you can draw lines back to everything and say, "That was worth it; that wasn’t worth it." I mean, what is the value of saying thank you to somebody? Would you want to A-B test that? If it turned out that it was worse to say thank you, would you not do it? No, you would do it because it’s still the right thing to do. 

So, a lot of our decisions are based on what feels right, what seems like the decent thing to do, and what kind of things we enjoy making. As long as we can look back at the end of the year and see that collectively, more worked than didn’t work, then we’re okay. That’s kind of how we look at it. We don’t have financial goals, OKRs, or KPIs. I don’t have revenue targets or growth targets in terms of the number of customers we need to pick up this year versus last year. I don’t look at any of those things. It’s just that at the end, if we make more than we spend, then the things we did this year were worth it. And that’s kind of how it goes.
