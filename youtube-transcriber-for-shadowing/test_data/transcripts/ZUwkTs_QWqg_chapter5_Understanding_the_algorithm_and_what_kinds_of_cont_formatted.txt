That people can find and see. Awesome. Again, I know this isn't like the area you spend all your time on, but maybe one more question along these lines. Give any sense of the kind of content that works best on LinkedIn in terms of the algorithm? 

You talk about how the algorithm is probably one of the bigger impact things that have changed. If there's anything with knowledge or advice, I think that's what a lot of people are looking for. Every time we run these surveys, every time we talk to people about what they want, those are the things that really connect to opportunity that people seek after on our system. 

And you're a great example of that, right? You're able to give knowledge and advice in an area with a lot of depth. I think that maybe that's why you're having some of the success you're seeing on the platform, which is wonderful to see. 

I think I'm actually not getting as much success as I could because I don't put in the time. I usually just kind of post a simple thing with a link. I think I could be more successful if I really dedicated time to creating more content within the actual post. 

That actually makes me happy. I mean, my guess is what you want to be doing is learning and creating, not spending a lot of time managing the platform. So maybe that's actually a good thing. It's actually another wonderful thing to hear. Yeah, absolutely.
