So there's very interesting insight that I heard from Scott Belsky from Adobe, and now he's doing some fascinating stuff. This insight has stayed with me: modern internet consumers have three attributes. They are lazy, vain, and selfish. 

Lazy means they don't have time for anything that doesn't blow their mind. If you can't capture their attention immediately, they won't engage. This reflects their habits; they solve problems in a particular way, and when you introduce a new product, you’re asking them to change their established habits. Do you really expect them to do that? The second attribute is vanity, and the third is selfishness. They want to know what's in it for them. 

Once you start thinking about users in this way, especially if they aren't even using your product, you realize how challenging it is to attract this kind of customer. If your marketing team has successfully brought users to your product, the next step is to empathize with these lazy, selfish, and vain customers. You need to build your product in a way that makes it indispensable to them. 

The way you write your copy, design your onboarding process, and create that first warm welcome will have a more significant impact on your product's success than the core features you develop for your loyal consumers. This insight has been applied multiple times in my experience, not just in the companies I've worked with but also in those I've consulted and spoken with. User onboarding is often neglected, but understanding how crucial it is to think like a user who is lazy, vain, and selfish is essential. 

It's extremely challenging, but it's worth it if you adopt that perspective. An example of using this framework can be seen in my work at Swiggy over the last seven years. Initially, we viewed our onboarding experience and product offerings from a generic standpoint, labeling ourselves simply as a food and grocery delivery app. 

However, we shifted our approach to focus on what users truly wanted and how they could benefit from our services. We began connecting our marketing messages with the onboarding experience. We asked ourselves questions like: Where did users find us? Why haven't they downloaded our app yet? Have they used us before and rejected us? 

By building a mental model around these questions, we considered the entire journey of a user hearing about us. We looked at the triggers and marketing messages that led them to download our app. From the initial splash screen offering a discount to the ongoing user experience, we ensured that the language and design were consistent and user-friendly. 

This focus on user experience immediately yielded positive results. This principle applies not only to single-product apps but also to those with multiple offerings. Many companies struggle with cross-selling, and understanding why users may not engage with additional services is crucial. 

Currently, I’m working with a company called Jupiter, a financial services app and Neobank that offers various services, including personal accounts, savings accounts, credit cards, and investments. Users often engage with only one service and then disengage. The key is to recognize that these users have found value in one area but may not be interested in the other offerings. 

Empathizing with users and considering behavioral science aspects can help convert them from one service to another. This understanding is essential for driving engagement and growth in a competitive landscape.
