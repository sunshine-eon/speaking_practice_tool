Okay, final fact. So Kip, is that how you pronounce the name Kip, your CMO? Okay, great. I asked him what to ask you, and he tells me something that's really unique and interesting about you: you're obsessed with copywriting and comedy and keynote prep. You have a very unique approach to preparing for a talk and how you think about humor, slide design, and story art. That's very true. Public speaking is not something that comes naturally to me. So we're going to start there. We can talk a little bit about the copywriting and other things that are sort of related. I tried to avoid things that I'm not good at and don't enjoy. 

One of the rare exceptions that I snuck through is the need for me to get on stages as a founder during our annual Pop Spot event, our conference. When we did our first one, it was like 150 people at the Marriott, right? Since then, it has steadily grown, and now it will be like 10,000 people in the live audience and hundreds of thousands online. As I realized that I was not going to be able to talk my way out of it, I saw where this was headed. I understood that this was something I would have to actually learn because I couldn't delegate it or talk my way out of it.

I'm a big believer in the concept of talent versus skill. We all understand talent; it's like someone has a talent for music or athletics. That's true, but talent basically controls the slope of the curve. Most things are actually acquirable skills. For instance, if you have a talent for music, you might learn it faster than someone else, and your ceiling may be higher, but that doesn't mean other people can't learn music. That's kind of lesson number one.

Lesson number two is that there is a process, and this is the engineer in me, of functional decomposition of a problem. To be a pretty good public speaker, I had to identify the underlying sub-skills required to accomplish that. Skill number one is being able to stand up on stage and not pass out—that's the bare minimum. Over the years, I functionally decomposed the skill of public speaking, especially in what I call high-stakes speaking. I realized I had to hold the audience's attention; nothing else matters if I lose their attention, which is increasingly easy to do in a short attention span society.

Every year, I pick a different part of the public speaking skill set to learn about. For example, I focused on slide design and visual expression—not to become an actual designer, but to enhance my talks. The one thing that has had the most impact is humor. I broke that skill down just like an engineer would. There’s humor writing, humor execution on stage, and stand-up comedy. I asked myself how to put all these pieces together.

Along that journey, I developed a data-driven, quant-based approach. I wanted to know how to measure whether something was actually funny enough or if I was losing the audience's attention. In preparation for one of these high-stakes keynotes, I would practice my talk in front of increasingly larger live audiences. I recorded those talks, and I had them transcribed. I even created custom software that identifies the points at which the audience laughed—audibly laughed, because that's the only way it counts.

This leads to a metric that stand-up comedians use called LPM, laughs per minute. There’s a benchmark for this; stand-up comedians have a very high LPM, while business talks generally have a low LPM. The most popular TED talks correlate strongly with high LPMs. So, I set a goal to improve my LPM. My software calculates the laughs per minute, and I learned tricks of the trade to improve that ratio. 

To increase LPM, you can either add more laughs or decrease the number of words between laughs. My software provides a visual map of the entire talk, broken down into segments. It shows where the audience laughed, and I can see if I went a minute and 17 seconds without a laugh. From there, I have to either shorten that segment if nothing funny can be said or find something funny to inject into it.

Anyway, that's a long way of saying that if I can get up on a public stage and learn that particular skill, anyone can learn just about anything. It just comes down to practice, measurement, and getting incrementally better over time.
