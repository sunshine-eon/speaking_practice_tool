Awesome. I want to go in a completely different direction. It feels like you have a lot of contrarian opinions about how to build product, how to build teams, and how to build companies. So I just want to start broad. What are some things you have contrarian opinions about? Things you believe that a lot of other people maybe don't believe or see differently?

One example is the concept of excellence in speed. There's always a question around that: would you rather ship faster, or would you rather ship better? In my opinion, when you have to make a choice, think more and ship better. Most experiments should be thought experiments; they should not even be tried out because they're obviously going to fail. This is contrary to the mindset of "let's try it out and then see." I believe that if you have smart people who can do better thinking, a lot of experiments would just not even be necessary. It's not a hard rule, but it's a preference. Speed and excellence are two different axes. Ideally, you should be better at both, but if you had to choose one, choose excellence.

Another contrarian opinion I have is regarding product managers. I think most product managers—at least the kind of people I've worked with and interacted with—should not even be in that role. They should think a little bit more about whether this is actually the right field for them. Many people from other areas have entered the field without fully realizing what it takes to succeed. While there is definitely a way to coach yourself and work your way upwards, it can make you quite miserable if it's not the right fit for you.
