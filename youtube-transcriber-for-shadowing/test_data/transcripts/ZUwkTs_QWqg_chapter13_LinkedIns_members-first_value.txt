============================================================

[33:23] That was make total sense to me.
[33:24] Are there other core values of LinkedIn
[33:27] that are public that you can share?
[33:28] I mean, you can Google them too.
[33:29] And so they're very, very public,
[33:31] but probably the one that I think is most important
[33:34] to talk about in this world is,
[33:38] there's this concept of members first.
[33:40] And I think anytime you run an ecosystem as complex
[33:42] as we do, and you think about it,
[33:44] even if you're trying to connect people opportunity,
[33:46] there's two people, how are you gonna decide right now
[33:48] who needs it?
[33:49] I think having clarity on which piece of the ecosystem
[33:52] is gonna be where the focus is.
[33:55] It helps us make sure we establish a relationship,
[33:57] a trust first,
[33:58] make sure to understand who's getting access to data,
[34:00] make sure we understand our decisions that we may,
[34:02] and I always love that as a principle that we've stuck by.
[34:05] Yeah, I see it on the picture.
[34:06] We put members first.
[34:09] So...
[34:10] Great, checks out is what you're telling me.
[34:11] Checks out, checks out.
[34:13] What's interesting is the connecting people to opportunity,
[34:16] economic opportunity is not one of these values.
[34:18] It seems like it's even broader.
[34:20] Mission of the company basically.
[34:23] Got it. Okay. I love that.
[34:25] This episode is brought to you by Epo.
[34:27] Epo is a next generation A.B. testing platform
[34:30] built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams.
[34:33] Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch,
[34:36] and Cameo rely on Epo to power their experiments.
[34:39] Wherever you work, running experiments
[34:41] is increasingly essential,
[34:42] but there are no commercial tools
[34:44] that integrate with a modern growth team stack.
[34:46] This leads to waste of time building internal tools
[34:48] or trying to run your own experiments
[34:50] through a clunky marketing tool.
[34:52] When I was at Airbnb,
[34:53] one of the things that I loved most about working there
[34:55] was our experimentation platform,
[34:57] where I was able to slice and dice data
[34:59] by device types, country, user stage.
[35:02] Epo does all that and more delivering results quickly,
[35:05] avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles,
[35:07] and helping you easily get to the root cause
[35:09] of any issue you discover.
[35:11] Epo lets you go beyond basic click-through metrics,
[35:13] and instead use your North Star metrics
[35:15] like activation, retention, subscription, and payments.
[35:19] Epo supports tests on the front end,
[35:21] on the back end, email marketing,
[35:23] even machine learning clients.
[35:25] Check out Epo at geteppo.com.
[35:28] That's geteppo.com and 10X your experiment velocity.
