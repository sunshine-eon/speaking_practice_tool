============================================================

[00:00] Coming back to something we touched on a bit is this idea of smaller teams.
[00:04] So you tweeted this similar stats.
[00:06] I'm just going to read these numbers in terms of your competitors.
[00:09] So Asana has 1,600 employees.
[00:12] ClickUp has 1,000 employees.
[00:14] Slack has 2,500 employees.
[00:16] Smartsheets has 3,000 employees.
[00:18] Monday has 1,500 employees.
[00:20] You have, I think you said 70 something employees.
[00:22] Yep.
[00:23] And you have similar numbers of customers, about 100 to 150,000.
[00:27] And you make a lot of profit and they generally don't.
[00:31] How is this possible?
[00:33] We run a very different kind of business.
[00:36] So we are focused on efficiency.
[00:41] We're not focused on growth.
[00:43] They're focused on growth.
[00:45] And so typically when you have a lot of people,
[00:47] you think you can do more things at once and you probably can.
[00:49] And you do more things at once and have different kind of offerings
[00:52] to different people and different tiers and sales people
[00:54] and all the things that build up an organization.
[00:56] We don't have any sales people.
[00:58] We don't have 15 different versions of Basecamp.
[01:02] We're not after enterprise.
[01:04] So we don't have the enormous support costs and enormous support
[01:07] infrastructure required to service customers like that
[01:10] and customize this and customize that to keep a whale happy
[01:13] who's paying you $300,000 a year.
[01:15] We don't have any of those things.
[01:17] We have one price, basically.
[01:19] Well, we have two prices on Basecamp.
[01:21] One price on Hay.
[01:22] Actually two price on Hay.
[01:24] Two, basically.
[01:25] But one code base, one product we offer everybody.
[01:29] And let's take Basecamp, for example.
[01:31] Nobody can pay us more than $300.
[01:33] I don't care how big your company is.
[01:35] The most you can pay us is $290 to get unlimited users.
[01:39] And what that allows us to do is to just build one product,
[01:43] do a really nice job, keep it tight and simple and clear
[01:47] and not have the complexity that comes with trying to
[01:50] service and satisfy so many different kinds of companies
[01:54] at different price levels with different price points
[01:56] and different expectations.
[01:57] That's why these companies tend to get bigger and bigger
[01:59] and bigger.
[02:00] They also, I think, frankly, build products just differently.
[02:02] We build products with two people at a time.
[02:04] So every feature we work on in Basecamp or Hay
[02:07] or whatever we're building is two people.
[02:08] One programmer, one designer,
[02:10] and they have a maximum of six weeks to deliver
[02:12] the feature that they're working on.
[02:14] Most of them are usually a couple weeks,
[02:15] but they have a maximum of six weeks.
[02:17] So we don't get stuck in these big, huge projects
[02:19] with meetings with 18 people and slow decision-making
[02:23] and indecision and complexity and all the things
[02:27] that come with trying to do too many things
[02:30] for too many people.
[02:32] Now, all that said, we could still make the mistake
[02:35] of hiring hundreds of people because we could afford
[02:38] to do so.
[02:39] But to spend money because you have it
[02:42] on things you don't need, I think,
[02:44] is something that Silicon Valley's gotten quite good at,
[02:46] but we're quite bad at intentionally.
[02:48] I don't want to spend money on things we don't need.
[02:50] So we think that constraints, simplicity, small teams
[02:54] actually are where it's at and keep us honest
[02:57] and allow us to do great work for our customer base
[03:00] that we know small businesses,
[03:02] very, very tight kind of companies like ours
[03:04] and satisfy them versus trying to, you know,
[03:06] go out for the big companies and have to have salespeople
[03:08] and have long sales cycles and whatnot.
[03:10] So I don't know.
[03:11] I mean, I wouldn't, honestly,
[03:13] if you gave me a thousand people,
[03:14] I wouldn't know what to do with them.
[03:15] We would fall apart.
[03:17] We would be a worse-off company with 500 people.
[03:20] I'd be completely lost.
[03:22] So that's the other thing.
[03:24] I don't even understand how they run
[03:25] and the amount of layers they must need
[03:27] and the amount of complexity organizationally
[03:29] that they must have to, like the latticework
[03:31] they have to build up to support all that weight
[03:34] is just remarkable and it's foreign to us.
[03:37] Okay.
[03:38] So I definitely want to talk about how you operate
[03:40] in your way of working because it's really interesting
[03:42] and there's a lot of companies can do that.
[03:44] But I want to follow on this thread of small teams.
[03:46] I have a few quotes that you've shared that I love.
[03:48] Oh, no.
[03:49] Oh, no.
[03:50] No good.
[03:51] That's good.
[03:52] Hey, if I said it, I said it.
[03:53] Let's go.
