[00:00] that come to life.
[00:01] The email product, is that like an email client product,
[00:04] or it's a design emails that you can then send
[00:06] through your products?
[00:07] It is design emails.
[00:09] So you can design email, then you can take that code,
[00:11] and you can pop it into any email platform that you use.
[00:14] How do you think about products you're going to expand to?
[00:16] I know there's like trade secrets here,
[00:17] you don't want to tell everyone where you're going next,
[00:18] but just how do you approach, here's where we're going next.
[00:21] So our mission, empower the design,
[00:23] empower everyone to design anything
[00:25] with every ingredient in every language on every device,
[00:28] and just take those things very literally.
[00:30] So to literally design anything,
[00:32] to literally publish anywhere.
[00:36] And so, we now print in,
[00:39] oh, 50 something countries around the world,
[00:42] and you can get it printed, delivered to your house,
[00:44] and we planted it.
[00:44] I actually did that while you were around here.
[00:46] Oh, awesome.
[00:48] That's the rant, I wasn't planning this,
[00:49] but I had a print thing delivered to my house.
[00:52] Oh, awesome, yeah, exactly.
[00:53] It was like, we have to go to a print shop
[00:54] in this freaking graphic, and then,
[00:56] well, it goes button, let's click back.
[00:57] Exactly, you just click print,
[00:58] and it pops up beautifully packaged to your door.
[01:00] I don't know how that works, yeah.
[01:01] I don't know how you did that, but it worked, how cool.
[01:03] That is very cool.
[01:05] And so, yeah, I guess literally bring these things to life.
[01:07] Oh, we're launching 3D as well.
[01:09] So all of these things,
[01:12] we will be bringing to life literally,
[01:14] and just picking off, like,
[01:15] what is the most strategically important next thing
[01:18] to enable everyone to design anything,
[01:20] to enable everyone to publish anywhere.
[01:23] And we have been doing that for a decade,
[01:25] and we'll continue to do that forever more.
[01:26] Using the latest technology
[01:28] to truly bring people's ideas to life.
[01:30] Okay, so this is helpful.
[01:31] So if someone's like, oh, well,
[01:32] well, Canva come for my space.
[01:35] Are there people designing things?
[01:37] That was design, and also, what was it, publish?
[01:39] Publishing anywhere.
[01:40] Okay, publishing and designing.
[01:42] Okay, so if you're doing any designing or publishing,
[01:46] watch out.
[01:47] From a macro perspective,
[01:49] there was creativity tools and productivity tools,
[01:52] and what Canva really does is,
[01:54] we're literally smack bang in the middle
[01:55] of that then diagram of creativity and productivity,
[01:58] rather than making our customers have to make a choice
[02:01] between those two tools, two suites.
[02:03] Something I wasn't planning on asking about,
[02:04] but I think it's on everyone's minds.
[02:06] There's always this like,
[02:07] Bigma and Adobe, and then there's Canva,
[02:09] and there's kind of a bunch of places we could go with this.
[02:11] One is just at the beginning of the journey,
[02:13] where a lot of founders try to figure out their wedge
[02:16] and their specific niche.
[02:19] Just how did you think about that?
[02:20] Like, here's how we might have a chance to,
[02:22] I know Figma wasn't even around back then, I don't think,
[02:24] just like, how did you approach your early wedge of users?
[02:28] One of the most important things that we did
[02:30] was we didn't really worry about competitors at all.
[02:33] We actually just saw, where is there a gap in the market
[02:35] that we can uniquely fill?
[02:37] And what can we solve a problem,
[02:39] a core problem that people currently have today?
[02:41] And so with our first company,
[02:43] that was Yearbooks in Australia,
[02:45] and there wasn't great tools,
[02:46] and these Yearbook coordinators got thrown in
[02:48] to have to design something,
[02:50] and they'd have no design experience.
[02:52] And we spoke to every single customer,
[02:54] we gave them an over-the-phone tutorial,
[02:56] we understood all of their pain points,
[02:58] we got continuous customer feedback,
[03:00] and then we tried to iterate and improve.
[03:02] And then when we were thinking about Canva,
[03:04] a few years into that, actually,
[03:06] one of the schools said,
[03:07] I love this product so much,
[03:09] can I use it to design newsletters?
[03:11] And they had all sorts of other things
[03:12] that they wanted to use it for.
[03:14] And we kind of looked around and were like,
[03:15] oh, there's still nothing on the market.
[03:18] This was like a few years into it
[03:20] that actually does the thing that we're doing,
[03:22] but for all these other things.
[03:23] And so it was much more like,
[03:25] where is the gap in the market
[03:26] that people are currently having a pain point?
[03:28] And if you can solve that pain point really well,
[03:31] and solve it in such a way
[03:32] that people actually wanna pay for it,
[03:33] because it is truly solving a real pain point that they have,
[03:37] I think that kind of sets it off the success
[03:39] rather than be a problem or a solution looking for a problem.
[03:43] So what I'm hearing there is you didn't overthink,
[03:45] here's my ICP, here's the wedge and the strategy
[03:47] of how we expand into this large thing.
[03:49] It's like, here's people with a problem
[03:51] that hasn't been solved in years
[03:52] that we keep seeing, let's try to solve it.
[03:54] Exactly that.
[03:55] And if you take that problem-centered approach
[03:57] that helps people to achieve something
[03:59] they actually want to do in the real life,
[04:01] you're probably gonna be a reasonably good spot,
[04:04] especially if it maps to a larger market.
[04:06] That's a particularly great thing.
[04:08] If it only solves one person's problem,
[04:10] that might not be a great company going forward.
[04:13] But if a few people have that same problem.
[04:15] But I think that again,
[04:16] like back to that big ladder and that first rung,
[04:20] I think it's better to solve
[04:22] a small number of people's problems really well
[04:24] than trying to solve a large number of people's problems.
