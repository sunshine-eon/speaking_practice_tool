============================================================

Think about building the company that builds the product. But I want to actually start here with how this conversation came to be. The CEO of Product Hunt, Rajiv, tweeted months ago, "Superhuman's product velocity feels like it's kicked into another gear as of late. Does anyone else notice this?" I saw that and thought, "I completely have noticed this." It feels like there's just feature shipping left and right—AI this, AI that. It feels like it's just like a new company. I tagged you on the tweet and said, "Hey, we're whole with changed." You answered with a few things, and it became clear that there was a lot to learn about what you did. Many companies are in this phase where things are moving as fast as we want. We used to be so much faster; we used to ship all these features, and now we don't. This is a really cool, real case study that we can analyze.

So let me ask you this: What did you notice that told you something needed to change at Superhuman? And then what did you change that actually had the most impact on your ability to ship and move faster? I think what we noticed was this sentiment. We felt it first ourselves, but we also started hearing it from the market, from our users, and from our customers that we had slowed down. As a founder and CEO, that's the absolute last thing you want to hear. It's our job, after all, to speed things up. When I asked people what they meant by slowing down, they didn't mean the product was working any slower, but that the pace of delivery seemed to have slowed down.

To break this down, it's important to start by defining what we mean by a slowdown. There's the kind of slowdown that is unavoidable in certain spaces, and then there's the kind that is quite avoidable. We actually had both. Starting with the unavoidable slowdown, you can classify anything that you build in a company into one of two categories: solution deepening and market widening. Solution deepening means making your product better for its existing users, but not making it available to more users. Market widening means making your product available to more users, but not making the product itself any better.

There are some spaces, some markets, and some platforms where market widening is really fast and easy. However, there are also spaces, like email, where market widening is really hard and slow. When we started, we had a great deal of focus; we only supported Gmail and were only on the web. In those early years, we could pour every ounce of R&D energy and every engineering dollar into solution deepening, making the product better for existing users. Of course, users loved it. It's how we got to product-market fit, and it's how most startups do.

But at a certain point, almost every company has to start investing in widening the market. For example, the market for people who will use a new Gmail front end without a mobile app does exist, but it is relatively small. This is something that every new email startup will learn sooner or later. To keep growing, you will need to add an iOS app, then a Mac OS app, then a Windows app, and then an Android app. Soon, you'll want to support Office 365, but that's not just one thing; that's actually three things because you have to support Office 365 on desktop, iOS, and Android. 

All of this is much easier said than done. I think we at Superhuman now know things about these APIs that literally no other company knows, and I would not wish it upon my worst enemy. Fast forward to today, and Superhuman now works wherever you do—on every combination of Gmail, Outlook, Mac, Windows, web, iOS, and Android. This actually turns out to be a really great technology moat; almost no other email app can claim this. It's taken many years of intense investment. 

One of the main reasons we can sell into the enterprise is that we now know everyone can use it. But here's the hard part: when you're doing that market widening, you're not solution deepening, and so your perceived product velocity may decrease. You can avoid some of these things with smart technology decisions, but mostly you just have to grind through it, and it is worth it to get to the other side. Then there's the kind of slowdown that is avoidable, and if I remember my answer to Richie's tweet, that was the kind I was talking about. In that case, it was our management structure.
