============================================================

[00:00] and often like CEOs are the ones,
[00:02] the founders are the ones that are thinking about
[00:04] what is the impact to our brand?
[00:07] Right?
[00:07] And so the CEO is thinking at the impact level,
[00:11] you're thinking at the execution level,
[00:13] there is that mismatch.
[00:16] We litigate the minutiae of whatever issue we're discussing,
[00:22] but we never really recognize
[00:24] that it's because we are kind of default thinking
[00:27] at different levels.
[00:28] And so this realization helped me better understand
[00:33] why there were conflicts between two very smart
[00:38] and well-intentioned people or groups within a company.
[00:42] And time and again, I noticed that,
[00:45] and I was myself guilty of this as well earlier on
[00:48] in my career, like time and again,
[00:49] I noticed that we kind of again keep litigating
[00:53] the specific issue without understanding that,
[00:56] there's actually just like a fundamental mismatch.
[00:59] And it's not like people are stuck at one level
[01:01] and can never think at a different level,
[01:03] it's just that we tend to default to certain levels.
[01:06] And that's like sometimes our preferred level,
[01:08] we can switch levels, but that requires a nudge sometimes.
[01:13] And so that observation helped explain a lot of things,
[01:17] including what kind of people an organization will promote.
[01:20] Like does it promote people who default operate
[01:24] at the impact level?
[01:26] Does it promote people who more,
[01:28] who default operate at the execution level
[01:31] or at the optics level?
[01:33] So it has like very wide-ranging impacts
[01:35] on just like overall how an organization functions.
[01:40] What's an example of optics and when optics matters,
[01:44] when you might not be thinking about the importance of that,
[01:46] just unpacking that one a little bit?
[01:48] Yes, so optics is about creating awareness
[01:54] of the impact and the execution that you're doing
[01:59] or your team is doing.
[02:01] That is the most compact definition
[02:02] I can come up with for optics.
[02:04] And optics is a good thing, right?
[02:07] So like I'm not saying don't think about optics whatsoever.
[02:12] I think it's actually important to think about optics.
[02:16] And now I'm talking about just internal optics.
[02:18] External optics is an entirely different thing
[02:20] and that's like marketing PR
[02:22] and that's definitely highly important.
[02:24] But even when we talk about simply,
[02:26] we limit scope to internal optics,
[02:28] I'll make the observation that you should be spending
[02:31] some time on internal optics
[02:34] because it creates energy, it creates awareness,
[02:37] it creates excitement, it creates opportunities for feedback.
[02:40] Those are all really great things
[02:42] and they will enable greater impact
[02:44] and better execution for you.
[02:46] The challenges, the challenge with optics is
[02:49] that in certain organizations, that balance gets thrown off.
[02:55] Where optics sometimes becomes the goal.
[03:00] Where somehow implicitly the organization
[03:03] or its culture has indicated to its people
[03:07] that as long as you do the optics well,
[03:09] you are going to be fine.
[03:12] You're going to be appreciated here.
[03:13] You're going to be rewarded here
[03:15] as long as you do the optics fine.
[03:17] And it's not like the organization woke up in the morning
[03:20] and said this is the culture we want to create.
[03:23] It just happens again through little actions
[03:26] that occur every day.
[03:28] It happens through who you hire,
[03:30] who you fire, who you promote.
[03:32] And what kinds of things do you appreciate at all hands
[03:35] as the CEO or the founder, right?
[03:38] Do you appreciate a launch?
[03:41] Do you appreciate results?
[03:43] Do you appreciate an, I don't know,
[03:45] an awesome status update that somebody sent?
[03:47] So a status update doesn't on its own accomplish anything.
[03:51] I mean, they are important,
[03:53] but a status update is an optics activity.
[03:55] Now it is a necessary optics activity,
[03:58] but if you start appreciating
[04:02] the necessary optics activities constantly,
[04:07] the signal you are sending to people is,
[04:10] oh, you got to focus on this optics activity, right?
[04:12] So then that becomes the goal.
[04:15] And that can be really harmful.
[04:17] So there's these three levels of product work.
[04:21] Do you have advice for, should I just like default
[04:23] to one of these normally based on just like as a PM,
[04:26] I should always be thinking about impact.
[04:28] Or is it more, just make sure you're aligned
[04:30] with your leader, with your team.
[04:32] Is that the more important takeaway?
[04:34] Yes, I think that's the more important takeaway
[04:36] is again, it's about now we have a vocabulary
[04:40] that we can talk about in an objective manner
[04:46] without kind of pointing fingers.
[04:48] It's like, oh, you tend to be, you know,
[04:50] fixated on all these execution details
[04:53] and like that's not the right thing.
[04:54] That's the type of feedback sometimes that gets shared.
[04:57] So now you have vocabulary to talk about this.
[05:00] And once you have that, you sort of can as a team decide
[05:04] what is most important given your context.
[05:08] I'll give you an example like for early stage teams.
[05:12] Yeah, of course they need to be thinking
[05:13] about the eventual impact, right?
[05:16] But what they should actually, I think,
[05:19] most early stage teams should actually optimize
[05:23] for execution, right?
[05:25] Assuming that they have come up with a reasonable hypothesis
[05:29] about what's going to win,
[05:31] their main emphasis, net, needs to be on execution
[05:36] because you will not see impact readily
[05:39] on a one week horizon or a one month horizon
[05:42] or perhaps even on a quarterly horizon.
[05:45] So that's an example of a situation
[05:46] where let's be explicit, right?
[05:48] Like we need to get great at execution.
[05:51] We have a set of core insights
[05:54] that were informed by our desire to make an impact.
[05:58] But now that we are like responsible
[06:00] for converting these insights into a product,
[06:03] let's be largely operating at the execution level.
[06:09] As an example, say there is a platform team
[06:12] and that platform team has had some issues lately
[06:15] with availability that has disrupted some other teams
[06:18] within the company and their products.
[06:21] Perhaps that platform team should have a conversation
[06:23] that, you know what, yes, we need to focus on impact,
[06:26] obviously to kind of avoid this negative impact.
[06:30] But also let's pay some more attention to optics
[06:35] because we haven't been communicating with teams as much,
[06:39] teams that rely on us, right?
[06:40] So let's create a better communication channel with them.
[06:44] Let's create better status updates for them or whatnot.
[06:47] So again, the point is not so much like,
[06:50] oh, you should just, this is the right level
[06:51] and all other levels are wrong.
[06:53] It's about being sensitive to what's right in this situation.
