============================================================

[00:00] Rahul, thank you so much for being here.
[00:06] Welcome to the podcast.
[00:07] Hello, hello, and thank you for having me, Lenny.
[00:10] I have so many questions for you.
[00:12] We're going to have so much to talk about.
[00:14] I actually want to start with your time before Superhuman.
[00:18] When I was preparing for this chat, I actually asked you what's the most pivotal moment in
[00:21] your career in your life?
[00:23] And you told me that other than starting Superhuman, it was selling your previous company
[00:27] reported to LinkedIn.
[00:29] So let me just start there.

[01:14] And that by far, as you said, was the most pivotal thing I'd done in my career prior
[01:20] to starting Superhuman.
[01:22] Now, had I known that we'd amassed most of LinkedIn's active users onto one app, I would
[01:27] have sold it for far more.
[01:28] But the actual pivotal moment was really who I got to work with, because I reported to
[01:34] LinkedIn's head of growth, Elliot Schmuckler, and he was responsible for scaling LinkedIn
[01:39] from 25 million members to when I joined north of 250 million members.
[01:46] And during my first one and one, I learned the real secret behind virality and big hint,
[01:52] it's not about viral mechanics.
