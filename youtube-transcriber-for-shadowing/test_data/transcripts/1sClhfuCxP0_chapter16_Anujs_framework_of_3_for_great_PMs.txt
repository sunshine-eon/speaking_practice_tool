============================================================

[00:00] Is there something folks should look for there that'll tell them you probably
[00:03] shouldn't be a product manager, either motivation or skill set or background or anything?
[00:06] No, I don't think about like particular domains that you come from.
[00:10] I have like, again, a simple framework of three.
[00:13] I think the first thing is, is essentially raw sharps and that can
[00:18] manifest itself into problem identification and problem solving.
[00:22] That's one.
[00:22] Not so hard rotors in all of that.
[00:24] And that is super important.
[00:26] The second one is what I call drive or grit, because I think with
[00:30] that comes a whole bunch of qualities around curiosity, learnability,
[00:34] never giving up, consumer backward thinking.
[00:38] I would really want to solve this and all of that that that comes with
[00:40] that a third which is a little difference.
[00:42] We talked about that is influence.
[00:44] You're in the business of influence and if you can kind of see yourself
[00:48] that I'm I'm built this way or I want to really get better at these.
[00:53] That's when I think this field is going to serve you well.
[00:56] I love that.
[00:57] Everything is three.
[00:57] How handy only the babies are for I wish I could come presently.
[01:04] There's too many things to do there.
[01:05] Essentially, these are your, maybe your perspective on the most
[01:08] important PM skills that a good way to think about influence
[01:10] grid and just being smart.
[01:14] And I think what you said here is not like you have to be
[01:16] amazing at these to get into product and do all it's you need
[01:19] to be excited about getting better.
[01:21] Yes, that's right.
[01:23] Because I think it's it's not as if that everybody is born with
[01:26] like a lot of influence like of course you can get better at
[01:29] it, but it's just a prospect of of that.
[01:31] Hey, I will need to be influential to succeed at this job.
[01:34] That should excite you and not scare you away and you
[01:36] should not think that hey, you know what?
[01:40] I can get away from this and still be very successful product
[01:42] manager because most likely you will know.
