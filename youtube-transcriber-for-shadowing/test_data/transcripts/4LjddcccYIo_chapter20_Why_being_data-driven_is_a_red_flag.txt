============================================================

[00:00] What is something that you believe about product management that maybe other people are less convinced by?
[00:06] The one I like to have in this area is that
[00:10] people who are really excited about being data-driven to me that is oftentimes a red flag for their product thinking.
[00:20] Especially if it's you know an executive who's saying things like, oh, we're so data-driven. We make all our decisions
[00:26] you know with our dashboards.
[00:28] To me, that says that the team is over-emphasizing quantitative data at the expensive
[00:36] qualitative data, and they're not using good judgment. They probably don't do a lot of direct user research.
[00:42] They don't really understand the humans who are using the thing, what they need, what they care about, and they're managing via a dashboard.
[00:50] And maybe if they got really really good at picking metrics,
[00:55] it would be fine. And oftentimes, maybe it is fine. Maybe you have a high volume business
[00:59] that's really easy to run experiments on and that works for you, but
[01:05] most PMs, most jobs, most products,
[01:09] you're going to be better off talking to 10 users and you'll get more and better insights out of why things are happening than you would with any dashboard thing.
[01:18] So the takeaway there is just like be careful when someone is
[01:22] saying they're super data-driven, our team is super data-driven, our company is super data-driven.
[01:27] Yeah, and maybe it's true, right? And that's great. I'm not saying that you don't need data.
[01:30] You absolutely do need to instrument your products and understand if it's working at scale, but you can't forget that
[01:37] you need to know why. It won't tell you why anything is happening. If you don't understand why it's happening,
[01:42] I don't think you can come up with good insights about what you should do next.
[01:46] Wait, one quick story on this. I remember really early on in my career, Adam Medros, who was the VP Rata Detriburvisor,
[01:52] we were in a room. We just had this meeting called Product Review that was amazing when I first joined and
[01:58] someone was like justifying this project and he just, and I hope he is okay with me saying this,
[02:03] because this is my memory of this moment. He was just like, this is an obviously better thing.
[02:08] Like just do it. Like stop, stop it. Like stop doing all the stuff that you're doing.
[02:12] Like stop with these numbers. Like whatever it was they were doing. Like if it's obviously better,
[02:15] if it's logically better, use your good judgment to do that thing and like let's move on.
[02:19] I've always thought about that, but like you can just do the obviously better thing.
[02:25] Yeah, I love that. I pull that card sometimes, but I think you almost have to do it that way.
[02:31] Just like, okay, everyone. This one's just like obviously a good idea. Let's just do it. Yes. Enough research.
