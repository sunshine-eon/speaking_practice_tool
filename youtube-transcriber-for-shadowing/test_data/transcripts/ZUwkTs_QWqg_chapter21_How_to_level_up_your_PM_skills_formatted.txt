============================================================

To kind of build on that, with PMs that work for you and work with you, when they're looking to get better and build their skills, other than taking some courses on LinkedIn Learning, what do you often recommend they do to help become stronger and better at their job? 

First, it is that feeling of ownership. You've got to own your product and you've got to speak up and say, "This is where I want to drive it." A lot of times, I think people are scared to do that or worried about doing that, or they don't feel that's their actual role. So, one, it's about extreme clarity on what is expected of them. Their role is to own this and take it to the next level. When you start molding the clay, people want to come and help. When you start building something cool, people gravitate toward it. But until you can start doing that, it's really tough.

So, one, it's letting people know what’s expected of them. And then two, I would tell people to just build. As crazy as it sounds, I spend a lot of my time on the side just trying to build different things. I mean, I try different clay and think through different ideas. I think that is a really important skill to have—to be able to say, "Okay, I'm going to start with a blank sheet and make some art," or whatever it is you want to do. 

I encourage people to do that because it's a muscle like anything else, right? You can get a kinesthetic feel for it. I really do think that, at the heart of product management, is that ability to be a builder, and you do have to make sure you can keep doing it.
