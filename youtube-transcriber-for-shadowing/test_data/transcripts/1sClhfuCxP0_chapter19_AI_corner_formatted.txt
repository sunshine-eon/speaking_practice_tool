============================================================

Okay, let's go to AI Corner, something I'm trying to do with every guest. Is there anything you've learned about working with AI that you think might be helpful to listeners?

Yeah, I think a couple of things. I think working with AI, many, many, many teams and companies get too excited about AI and the possibilities and so on. It's almost like a solution where you find a problem within their companies, which is fine because now you're thinking about what this particular technology can do for my company. So it's a good way to start. 

However, many people don't actually use it in the best way possible and force fit it. Instead of that, you can think about how to get AI to work with AI. This connects back to something I call H.I. Just to make sure that everybody understands, artificial intelligence is important, but human intelligence is just as crucial. If you're not humanly intelligent, you're not going to be artificially intelligent.

This understanding can really help your company a lot. So literally, any product that you're building, even if it is technologically interesting and exciting, needs to be balanced out and work together with great UX and behavioral science. The combination of those two will ensure that you're getting the best outcome, unless you're building something that is completely vacuumed with no human intervention or consumer products largely.
