============================================================

You mentioned also that you have no growth goals, that you make decisions a lot on instinct and gut and opinion, which sounds amazing. It's great if you could pull it off. It feels also very hard to operationalize and maybe make the best decisions in times. Can you just talk about how you actually operationalize that and what you find happens when you approach things that way?

I will just admit that that's the only way I've ever known how to work. I don't know how to make decisions by numbers or I don't find any joy in it, frankly. I've always been intuition-driven and gut-driven, and frankly, to be honest, I think everyone actually is. This is part of the thing I want to write up. I've been thinking about writing about this. I think everything's a judgment call. 

Data can play a part; all sorts of things can play a part. But unless you're letting a machine make the decision that's purely rational, if you're asking a human to make it, it's a judgment call. They're bringing to bear thousands of things they know and don't know about that influence them about this particular decision. 

And it's why, like when companies hire executives, what are they looking for in an executive? They typically want judgment and experience. They're not looking for someone who can read an Excel spreadsheet. That's not the thing that matters. Anyone can read that or anyone can read a chart, or you can learn to do that. They're looking for judgment and experience, which is a very amorphous thing. 

It's like, what is it really? Well, they've been around. They've seen a lot of things. They've absorbed a lot of experiences, and they're going to bring those indescribable things to bear to make decisions for the business. So out of all the things, data might be one thing, but there are thousands of things that go into a decision, many of which you don't even know. 

I just feel like I'm comfortable admitting that I don't really know why I'm making these calls, but I'm making these calls regardless. I'm not looking at a number and going, if this is 51% versus 49%, I'm going this way for sure. That could be an input perhaps, but it's not the only input. I think people should recognize that even if you're a data-driven person, there's so much more at play here. 

So I just feel like just being honest about that is sort of how I've always looked at it. I also will admit, as I just mentioned, I don't know the things that go into my decision-making process, but I'm absolutely fascinated by decision-making. I think it's one of the most interesting human endeavors. 

I would just say that give your intuition credit. Give your gut credit. It's absorbed everything, and plus the things that you don't know that absorb that are valuable.
