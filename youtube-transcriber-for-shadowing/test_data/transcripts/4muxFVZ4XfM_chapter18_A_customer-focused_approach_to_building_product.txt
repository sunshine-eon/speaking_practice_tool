============================================================

[00:00] That's what I imagined you were going to say, and I love hearing that.
[00:04] For someone that wants to create a similar culture, is there tactically anything you
[00:09] find to understand if your employees and engineers, designers have enough of that context and
[00:14] really understand the problem?
[00:16] I think it's always different people, different people in a company will have different understandings.
[00:22] It's not like you can expect everyone will every day go to see everything and has this.
[00:30] But we do sometimes like sessions with the team or we do record videos with the customers.
[00:36] We kind of write notes and we share this with people.
[00:40] I feel like, again, it's like fairly apparent if people, if you know your customers are
[00:46] the product, it's a very different way you can talk about it versus if you don't have
[00:50] any idea.
[00:51] If you don't have any idea, you probably don't even know what to say.
[00:55] I think it's apparently people have that.
[00:58] It's not like every project we need, everyone to have this understanding, it's usually enough
[01:06] if one or two people have that understanding or have different understanding of different
[01:11] things.
[01:12] I think it's, again, I feel like it's a culture thing and I think the other thing
[01:16] is you kind of have to have the, you just have to kind of believe in it.
[01:22] I think sometimes people use data a lot or too much because they're worrying or they're
[01:28] afraid that will I make a wrong choice and I'm using data to make the choice for me.
[01:35] But then you might still feel like this is not the right choice, but the data is
[01:39] selling me as the right choice.
[01:40] Then turns out maybe it was the right choice or not, but it's more like, again, like
[01:44] a practice thing like you need to be, I think the company and you need to be okay that like
[01:48] sometimes we make mistakes and like we've made the wrong choice and then we just can
[01:52] fix it.
[01:53] But at least we made that choice and the data didn't make that choice for us.
