Chapter 2: The success of 37signals
Video: Jason Fried challenges your thinking on fundraising, goals, growth, and more
Time: 03:49 - 06:46
============================================================

[00:00] is to create a personal board of directors, a trusted peer group where you can discuss
[00:05] challenges you're having, get career advice, and just kind of gut-check how you're thinking
[00:09] about your work, your career, and your life.
[00:12] This has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted
[00:16] group.
[00:17] With Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted, private, supportive
[00:21] peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback.
[00:26] Sidebar has their own zone of genius, so together we're better prepared to navigate
[00:30] professional pitfalls, leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger
[00:35] impact.
[00:36] Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get
[00:40] focused tactical feedback at every step of your journey.
[00:43] If you're a listener of this podcast, you're likely already driven and committed
[00:47] to growth.
[00:48] A Sidebar personal board of directors is the missing piece to catalyze that
[00:52] journey.
[00:53] I spent a decade finding your people when you could meet them at Sidebar today.

[01:10] Jason, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.
[01:14] Thanks Lenny, it's good to be here.
[01:15] It's really good to have you on.
[01:17] I have this new segment on the podcast that I call Contrarian Corner, and I have
[01:21] this feeling like this entire episode is going to be Contrarian Corner.
[01:26] And so I'm excited to dig into all kinds of stuff.
[01:28] I have so many questions I want to ask you.
[01:30] I thought it'd be good to just start with giving people who aren't that familiar with
[01:34] your story and 37 signals a sense of just how successful the business has been.
[01:40] I think people don't quite get the business you've built and the scale you've built.
[01:44] So whatever you can share in terms of customers, profits, anything you are comfortable
[01:49] sharing, you'd love to give people, especially things that might surprise people, just a
[01:52] sense of like, wow, this business is not what I imagined.
[01:55] We don't talk about things that don't really matter so much like revenues don't really
[01:59] matter because you can go broke generating a lot of money.
[02:01] But we talk about profits.
[02:03] So we've historically, let's say over the past 10 years or so, we've been profitable
[02:08] every year for 24 years, but let's say over the last 10 years, we've been doing
[02:11] a double digit million dollar profits on an annual basis, which is really nice.
[02:16] We've about 100,000 plus paying customers.
[02:18] That's a rough number.
[02:19] And we've about currently like 75 or so employees.
[02:23] So relatively small business in terms of the number of people work here, big customer base,
[02:30] big profits.
[02:31] And that's sort of how we like to keep it.
[02:32] And that's sort of something that we've always focused on versus a lot of these other
[02:35] metrics that I hear a lot and there are usually there's acronyms attached to them
[02:39] and I kind of don't even know what they are and I don't really care about them
[02:42] so much.
[02:43] We also want to make more money than we spend, have good healthy margins, which allow us to
[02:47] sort of experiment and play and not be afraid to do things that may not work and and just
[02:53] enjoy ourselves.
[02:54] So that's what we've been doing for about almost 25 years next year, we are 25th
[02:56] year.
