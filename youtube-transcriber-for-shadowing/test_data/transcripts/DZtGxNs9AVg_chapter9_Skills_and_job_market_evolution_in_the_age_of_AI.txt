============================================================

[00:00] Like what's interesting about this in one way is people wonder just what jobs will be more important,
[00:06] what skills will be less important. Let me share a thought I have and then I want to get your take
[00:10] and see where you go with this. It feels like what is getting more valuable is being good at
[00:16] figuring out what to build and then knowing if the thing you had built is correct and good and
[00:23] it's like discovery, ideation, idea, part of the step of launching a product and then it's like
[00:30] taste and craft. Is this the thing? Is this going to solve people's problems? Because the building
[00:37] now is being done more and more and it's interesting. It used to be the reverse engineering was
[00:41] the hardest, most valuable skill and now it's like figuring out what to build. You could sit
[00:45] there and you could just tell what to build and a lot of people get to your screen and I'm
[00:49] sure and they're like, I don't know what to build. I don't know what people want and it's like that's
[00:53] the thing now. So just a reaction to that and thoughts on what skills will matter more and less.
[00:59] I mean if you're a founder or you want to build something, yeah I totally agree that
[01:04] figuring out what are pain points and seeing like there are probably often
[01:11] currently solutions to every some kind of solution to everything. What is the
[01:15] in how can you make these 10x better somehow like figuring that out is super important. When you
[01:20] have an existing product then I think taste and like if I had tasting what is what is good is even
[01:28] more of the important part. The tech like the engineer skill set is still going to be important
[01:35] because that helps you understand what are the constraints so what you can build and I just
[01:41] think a lot of software engineers are probably a bit scared now like okay am I out of a job and
[01:47] if what's going to happen but they should see themselves as the people who translate the problems
[01:53] that are stated by a human probably to a technical solutions and but they do have to abstract
[02:02] themselves up a few steps not just like looking at the in their tech stack like oh I can just
[02:05] do the front end genius. They engineers or technical people are very good at understanding
[02:10] what are the constraints technically and they should see themselves as that translators.
