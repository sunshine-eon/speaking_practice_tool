============================================================

If I were to ask people who are the most inspiring leaders in tech and in business in general, I think you'd be right near the top of that list. You've been through a lot of ups and downs. You've learned a lot of lessons along the way. What have you found has been most helpful to helping you continue to grow and keep up with the business, the way the business has grown, the scale, and just to take on this leadership role? Is it like coaching? Is it reading? Is it other mentors? Something along those lines.

You asked really good questions. And by with thank you. I, um, I'll share a few thoughts. I was with Sam Altman probably a few weeks ago at dinner and I told him, yeah, I still feel like I have a lot to prove. I haven't made it yet. And he was really surprised. He's like, what are you talking about? I didn't even realize that he thought that was an absurd notion. But I said, no, I haven't made it yet. It's not to say I'm not grateful or I feel like I need to get somewhere so that therefore I'll feel like worthy. But I have this still, this kind of beginner's mindset that the bigger I get, the more a beginner I tend to feel. It's like a weird feeling.

I think like when you, when I first took off, I think I thought I would like maybe like I knew everything or I knew more than I certainly did. But then you get past some peak. We go into this proffer, you realize, oh my God, the moment you get to some frontier of knowledge, you start to become a beginner again and everything is new. And so I think the first thing I try to do is to be a beginner. You know, Pablo Picasso had a saying, he said, it took me four years to learn to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to learn to paint like a child. And so I've tried to always see the world through the eyes of a child. 

I think one of the key characteristics of a child is curiosity, to see everything with fresh eyes, to not have too many judgments. When I was trying to figure out how to run the company, I studied the history of division organizations and I studied Steve Jobs, but also studied like what Bill Gates did. I studied like Alfred Sloan at General Motors that MIT Sloan is named after. And actually the founding of divisional companies, which I believe was DuPont, they were making powder for gunpowder. The war ends. What do you do with powder? Turns out powder can be used for paint, but the way you sell gunpowder and paint are different sales channels. So they created what we now know as the divisional structure.

So I try to like understand the sources of things. I try to learn. I try to be shameless about reaching out to help. I think that a lot of people are afraid to reach out to help because they think other people are busy. The biggest honor most people get in their lives or one of the biggest honors is when other people ask them for help, because we all just want to feel useful. So don't feel ashamed to reach out to something for help. It actually like it gives a lot of them great honor. 

And I think you don't need to reach out to people 10 years ahead of you. They can just be people a year ahead of you. In fact, an entrepreneur getting started, I might be less youthful than somebody two years ahead of them that knows like the latest distribution channels that I like kind of have forgotten. So I think that that is the key. It's learning. It's growing. It's curiosity. It's constantly having that hunger and that fire to always want to be better to remember to feel like I haven't made it yet because the reason I say I haven't made it yet is because if I've made it, then I'm done. 

And I want to feel like an artist. You know, Bob Dylan used to say an artist has to be in a constant place of becoming. And so long as they don't become something, then they're going to be okay. So you have to always be evolving, learning, growing. And the canvas keeps getting bigger. The mountaintop keeps getting higher. And I feel like I'm just getting started. 

And I hope that, you know, the panel, I don't know how long you intend to do the podcast, but I intended this for a long time. And if you do or whatever, we'll definitely want to have talks. And I hope years from now, Lenny, I hope 70% of what I said, I still believe. But if 100% of what I say, I still believe that I probably haven't learned very much. And so if 90% I say, I don't believe anymore than I'm like, you know, kind of delusional and wrong. But I sincerely hope that I retract it or change or modify a few things I said today in a few years, because that will mean that I've gained more wisdom. And so how do I do that by being sure?
