============================================================

[00:00] Just to close this thought around whether, if you have an idea going the venture route
[00:06] makes sense, what do a venture scale companies need to achieve?
[00:10] What investors look for for that to even work out to your point, it almost never works out.
[00:14] What is it you have to do for it to feel like, okay, this is a venture scale idea
[00:17] versus this is an awesome idea.
[00:19] We could just make money every year, every month from it and not raise money and life
[00:23] will be great.
[00:24] I'm probably the wrong person to ask, but I mean, I would say there are versions
[00:27] of art.
[00:28] Let's just take Monday, for example, right?
[00:30] It's not, Basecamp and Monday are quite a bit different, but they live in the same world.
[00:35] We could have flipped.
[00:37] Someone could have had the Monday approach and sold Basecamp that way and Basecamp could
[00:42] have gone big in that way and Monday could have stayed small in our way.
[00:48] Again, I'd rather be my business than their business.
[00:51] I would not trade Basecamp for Monday's business any day of the week because I love
[00:57] what we're doing.
[00:58] We're profitable.
[00:59] We don't have to deal with the things they have to deal with.
[01:01] I wouldn't trade businesses or places with anybody, but you could imagine it could have
[01:05] been swapped.
[01:06] It's not that Basecamp couldn't be this big venture scale, whatever you want to call
[01:13] it.
[01:14] Although, look, we have the same number of customers roughly than they do.
[01:16] I guess we are a venture scale in that respect, but again, point is that depending
[01:25] on how you approach it, you can take anything in any different direction.
[01:28] It's more of a mindset.
[01:29] What are you after?
[01:30] We're not after that, and they are, so that's what they do, and we do it a different way.
[01:35] I don't necessarily think ... I mean, there's things like Airbnb is a great example.
[01:39] That has to have a certain degree of scale to really be something that no matter where
[01:44] you go in the world, you're like, I can get an Airbnb there.
[01:48] That's probably going to take money to get there.
[01:51] Same thing with Uber.
[01:52] Uber is another example.
[01:54] These are easy to pick, but they're great examples really.
[01:58] When Uber was getting started, they had to proliferate all over the country to begin with
[02:02] and all over the world.
[02:03] It was this reliable thing you could think of, just like you would think of a cab.
[02:06] If I went to New York or Chicago, I knew there'd be a cab.
[02:10] Was there going to be an Uber?
[02:11] I don't know.
[02:12] Well, you have to know that there's going to be one to begin to trust it.
[02:15] In order to do that, you have to expand rapidly.
[02:17] Those businesses exist, and those are great examples of venture-backed companies that
[02:21] need that massive initial push to be available in all the different places because they're
[02:27] actual physical products.
[02:29] Airbnb is a physical product.
[02:31] Uber is a physical product.
[02:33] Basecamp, Monday, Asana, they're available everywhere instantly anyway.
[02:38] I don't know what you need the money for other than marketing.
[02:42] It's interesting because marketing is losing them a lot of money, so it's an interesting
[02:46] thing.
[02:47] Anyway, you can talk to them about that.
