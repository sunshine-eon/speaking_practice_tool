And we've been really thinking through it. Let's actually talk about LinkedIn Learning. I know this is a big passion of yours. You have your own course within this that I want to talk about, but broadly, just what is LinkedIn Learning? Just so people understand, because I don't know if a lot of people know this exists within LinkedIn.

Great question. LinkedIn Learning is basically a way to learn professional skills. We entered the business in 2015, and the thesis was, it's kind of weird. Think about it as a marketplace again. You have seekers and jobs, and oftentimes, seekers may not have all the skills in order to get the job. We are moving now towards the skills model, but with that question, this out of second order impact, I don't think any of us wanted to kind of, if you will, like, Uberize the world. 

I don't think any of us wanted to make it that way. Everyone there wanted to ensure that everyone had the skills to learn and get there. So getting the learning business is really, really important for the vision and the mission. The idea was that we'd have ways to teach people skills that were very much tailored to professionals.

Now, that was kind of the vision. The way the mechanism works is we go and get the best instructors in the world. We bring them into a film studio, or we do it at home, in a way that makes the content extremely engaging. We help write the scripts, and we obviously have incredible graphics, all in a way that makes a teacher and someone who's an expert, who may not always have the capability or the time to create their own online course, able to shine in the studio.

The vast majority of people will probably have access through their company. The vast majority of the usage and kind of the business runs through enterprise and is a large enterprise learning problem. 

Awesome. Just as a quarter, I don't know, armchair quarterback strategy person, I could see where this came from. We're trying to help people connect to economic opportunity and find jobs. How do we help them? Oh, they don't have the skills. Let's help them build the skills. It makes a lot of sense.
