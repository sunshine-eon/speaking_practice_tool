Chapter 1: Elizabeth’s background
Video: How Netflix builds a culture of excellence | Elizabeth Stone (CTO)
Time: 00:00 - 04:36
============================================================

[00:00] We can't really have any of the other aspects of the culture,
[00:05] including candor, learning, seeking excellence
[00:09] and improvement, freedom and responsibility
[00:11] if you don't start with high talent density.
[00:14] And in some ways it's very reflective of Reed Hastings
[00:18] as founder of Netflix.
[00:20] So when he founded Netflix and grew the company over time,
[00:25] it was with a belief that there could be a different approach
[00:29] to building a company that would make it a place
[00:33] that people thrived in and loved being
[00:35] and would feel different than other places,
[00:37] both in the quality of that talent density,
[00:40] but even more importantly, like the excellence and the outcomes
[00:43] and that that's where people would derive
[00:45] a lot of sense of fulfillment.
[00:46] So it's very deeply seated at Netflix
[00:49] from its original days.
[00:51] And in order to do that,
[00:54] you have to really hold yourself to a lot of stuff
[00:58] that doesn't feel like natural human behavior.
[01:06] Today, my guest is Elizabeth Stone.
[01:08] Elizabeth is Chief Technology Officer at Netflix.
[01:11] And as far as I can tell,
[01:12] the first economist to ever be named CTO
[01:15] at a Fortune 500 company.
[01:17] Prior to this role,
[01:18] Elizabeth was Vice President of Data and Insights.
[01:21] Before Netflix,
[01:22] she was Vice President of Science at Lyft, COO at Nuna,
[01:26] a trader at Merrill Lynch,
[01:28] and an economist at Analyst Group.
[01:30] In our conversation, we cover a lot of ground.
[01:33] We talk about how an economics background
[01:35] has helped Elizabeth in her career
[01:36] and why she expects to see more economists
[01:38] rise in the ranks of tech companies.
[01:40] She shares some of her secret sauce for rising so quickly
[01:43] at so many companies so consistently.
[01:46] We delve into Netflix's very unique culture
[01:49] of high talent density, radical candor,
[01:52] and freedom and responsibility.
[01:53] We also talk about the structure that Netflix has
[01:56] for their data and user research teams,
[01:58] which she believes is a part of Netflix's secret to success.
[02:01] We also get into what biking and triathlons
[02:03] have taught Elizabeth about life
[02:05] and how she brings that into her work.
[02:07] And so much more, a huge thank you to Ali Rao
[02:10] for introducing me to Elizabeth.
