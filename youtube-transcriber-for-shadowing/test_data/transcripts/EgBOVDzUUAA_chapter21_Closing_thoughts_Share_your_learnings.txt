[00:00] Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else you wanted to
[00:03] share or leave listeners with anything, any last nuggets of thought?
[00:07] Well, I would love for the listeners from different fields of product is that please
[00:13] share what you're learning without being fearing judgment of your peers because there are
[00:19] many, many people who are learning only because you share your evolution and your thoughts.
[00:25] And I believe that a lot more could be contributing and a lot of your listeners are really bright
[00:30] people if they all shared many people from many places in the world would learn and achieve
[00:39] some amount of success.
