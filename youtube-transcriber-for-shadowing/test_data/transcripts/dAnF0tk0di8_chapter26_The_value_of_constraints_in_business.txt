============================================================

[00:00] What I'm hearing is essentially to do this well, you need discipline, like understand here's
[00:05] the incentives, they're driving me to spend more money, grow faster, and being really good
[00:10] at not, and then also it sounds like you just need investors that are on board with.
[00:15] We understand we're not going to focus on growth obsession, we're not going to focus
[00:18] on great routines, we're going to give you space to build it the way you want.
[00:21] And that exists, it's just also an outlier in that industry.
[00:24] I think what you need are constraints is what I'm actually trying to get at.
[00:27] You need constraints.
[00:28] And when you have just like loads of money, you basically have very few constraints.
[00:34] And so that's what tends to lead to slop versus like, hey, if we don't figure this out, we
[00:39] can't make payroll next week, or next month, like you just start to figure things out.
[00:44] One of the best stories I heard about this was Peter Rahall who started RX Bar.
[00:48] Are you familiar with RX Bar?
[00:50] Mm-hmm.
[00:51] Yeah, a little, you know, little protein bars or whatever.
[00:55] There's a great article about this years ago where he was talking to his dad about like,
[01:00] I think raising money or something, and his dad's like, hey, go sell a thousand fucking
[01:05] bars and come back and talk to me.
[01:08] He's like, just sell some fucking bars, get out on the street and sell some bars, man.
[01:11] You've got products, sell products, go sell versus like all the things you could possibly
[01:15] do if we had more like, go sell some fucking bars.
[01:18] And it's just such great advice.
[01:21] And it just cuts through all the crap.
[01:24] And so I just, I like that scrappiness.
[01:27] And you don't get scrappiness from having large S.
[01:30] You just don't.
[01:31] It's just, it's just too easy not to have to do anything.
[01:35] Not to say that VC companies aren't doing things, they're doing a lot of things, obviously.
[01:40] But are they honing the scrappy skills?
[01:44] Are they learning how to make money and have margin and be profitable?
[01:47] If they don't have to, they probably are not.
[01:50] And I think at some point, and we're starting to see this now.
[01:53] This is not like an, I told you so thing.
[01:54] This is just like, this is what happens, right?
[01:57] This is not me.
[01:58] This is just economic cycles.
[02:00] Money's harder to find.
[02:01] It's harder to get.
[02:02] Even companies who've raised money, investors are not interested in putting in additional
[02:05] rounds and there's deep cuts happening, layoffs, pain and suffering.
[02:12] It's hard to switch from having a lot to not having enough and then having to work
[02:21] as if you know what to do.
[02:23] I think there's a lot of confusion in the market now at companies now, I should say, because
[02:27] they don't know what to do.
[02:28] They haven't had to do it before.
[02:30] And I feel for them in a sense because like, how could they be expected to know what to
[02:34] do?
[02:35] Just like frankly, as I said earlier, if someone dropped 10 million bucks on me and
[02:39] a thousand people, I would have no idea what to do with that.
[02:41] Truly, I would not.
[02:43] I would waste it is what I would do.
[02:46] And so, you know, if you don't have the experience, how are you going to know?
