============================================================

[24:52] how to position yourself against some of the other candidates.
[24:55] What else can that a person looking for a job
[24:58] due to improve their chances of a recruiter
[25:02] basically finding them?
[25:03] I feel like that's probably the best tactical thing
[25:06] they can do,
[25:06] because a lot of LinkedIn is recruiters reaching out
[25:08] and finding you.
[25:08] There's two things that anyone who's hiring
[25:11] is always gonna look for.
[25:12] They're gonna look for your skills and capabilities
[25:14] and they're gonna look for your intent
[25:15] and interest in the role.
[25:17] And a lot of our products and the pathways
[25:19] we try to do are making those things simpler.
[25:21] So maybe we'll just start with interest and interest
[25:22] and we'll move back to skills in a minute.
[25:24] A couple of things we've launched recently,
[25:25] and I think they're symbolic of other ways you can connect.
[25:28] If you go to a company page and you're looking
[25:30] at the company, and I think they have to opt into this
[25:32] in some degree, and you say,
[25:34] look, you can say you're interested in that company,
[25:36] even though they don't have roles.
[25:37] And when the next role comes up,
[25:39] they'll have a signal that this person's actually
[25:40] very interested in this role.
[25:42] And that's an easy way to kind of signify
[25:44] from the early stage that you have interest in them.
[25:47] And that way, when they open up a role,
[25:48] as you can imagine, they start looking through,
[25:50] they'll have a spotlight and recruiter
[25:51] and they can click on it and come through.
[25:53] Certainly you can go into open to work
[25:54] and say that this is something that I'm open to work right now
[25:57] and you can signify to the whole population
[25:59] that this is an area that you wanna go for as well.
[26:02] And I would encourage both of those in some ways.
[26:03] If you're looking for a role, be open about it
[26:05] and tell the companies that you're looking for there.
[26:06] Those are really high signals of intent.
[26:09] The other thing you can do on LinkedIn
[26:10] is you can actually go through
[26:11] when you say open to work and you can specify
[26:13] like particular kinds of jobs and things you're looking for.
[26:15] And I think that more detailed intent
[26:17] helps make sure you're showing it to the right place.
[26:21] On the skill side, we kind of talked about a little bit,
[26:24] but I do think there's a big change.
[26:26] When you were just looking at title,
[26:28] I think you only had one way to really prove
[26:30] that you had the skills.
[26:31] You had to have that title, which is very hard to break in.
[26:33] In a world where you're looking at skills,
[26:35] you can go through and say, look, I can do these things
[26:37] and you could put evidence behind it.
[26:39] And I'd really encourage people to do that.
[26:41] If you just go to account of any job post,
[26:42] you can see the skills, you can say add,
[26:44] and you can see all the evidence and how you can add it.
[26:47] And I would really encourage people to do that
[26:49] because when people in Recruiter,
[26:50] and they're looking for skills, profiles pop up
[26:53] and you can scroll over a skill
[26:54] and you can actually see all those evidence.
[26:56] And you can basically a Recruiter can say,
[26:57] oh, this is why I'd recommend you to this hiring manager.
[27:00] And I think you will find that that's hopefully
[27:03] a very useful way of doing it.
[27:05] I'm gonna lob this question like a fishing line
[27:08] to see if there's catches anything.
[27:10] If not, we'll move on.
[27:11] Are there any stats that you've seen of just like,
[27:14] if you do XYZ, your chances of getting hired
[27:17] or getting people reaching out
[27:18] or just go significantly higher?
[27:20] Open to work certainly has a high signal to noise.
[27:23] And it's, as you can imagine,
[27:25] when someone's looking to fill a role, that's one they want.
[27:28] We are early in company commitments,
[27:29] but we are seeing some signal there
[27:31] that we gotta move through.
[27:32] Skills has a pretty high signal as well.
[27:34] When you're able to come through
[27:36] and show and demonstrate your skills,
[27:37] we're seeing some correlation
[27:40] to basically people getting a role.
[27:41] And then the final one that is harder for us to look through,
[27:44] but it's certainly important.
[27:45] I do think we show the hiring manager
[27:47] on a lot of the roles we show these people through.
[27:50] And it's harder for us to kind of trace that
[27:51] because of the way the outcomes kind of work.
[27:53] But I would really encourage people to look through that
[27:56] and see if you can get in front of those people.
[27:58] Is there a max seniority that you find works effectively
[28:02] on LinkedIn to find a job?
[28:04] Like I imagine like CPOs aren't finding jobs on LinkedIn.
[28:07] Is there just like, if I'm looking for a job,
[28:10] do you have like a rule of thumb of like,
[28:12] if you're at this level,
[28:13] maybe you're not gonna have a lot of luck
[28:14] if you're below this level.
[28:15] We certainly have CPO jobs that are posted,
[28:17] but the difference often is job post versus recruiting.
[28:22] And more senior roles are often recruited.
[28:25] And so we find that people will use LinkedIn
[28:27] in order to connect to a CPO.
[28:29] And many people who are senior will say,
[28:30] oh, I got a message on LinkedIn and that led to this,
[28:32] or they made a long-term recruiting contact.
[28:35] But it may not happen through you finding a job
[28:37] and hitting the application button.
