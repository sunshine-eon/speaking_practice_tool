Chapter 5: Overcoming slowdowns at scale
Video: Superhuman's secret to success | Rahul Vohra (CEO and founder)
Time: 13:32 - 18:06
============================================================

[00:00] think about building the company that builds the product.
[00:02] But I want to actually start here with how this conversation came to be.
[00:07] So the CEO of Product Hunt, Rajiv tweeted months ago, he tweeted this, and we're
[00:15] going to show this if you're on YouTube.
[00:16] Superhuman's product velocity feels like it's kicked into another gear as of late.
[00:20] Does anyone else notice this?
[00:22] And I saw that I'm like, I completely have noticed this.
[00:24] Feels like there's just feature shipping left and right, AI, this, AI, that.
[00:29] Feels like it's just like a new company.
[00:30] And I tagged you on the tweet and I'm like, Hey, we're whole with changed.
[00:33] And you answered with a few things and it just made it clear there's some, a
[00:37] lot to learn about what you did.
[00:39] Because a lot of companies are in this phase, I think of just like things are
[00:43] moving as fast as we want.
[00:44] We used to be so much faster.
[00:46] We used to ship all these features and now we don't.
[00:48] And so I think this is a really cool, real case study illustrative example
[00:53] that we can analyze.
[00:54] So let me ask you this.
[00:55] What did you notice that told you something needed to change at Superhuman?
[00:59] And then what did you change that actually had the most impact on your
[01:02] ability to ship and move faster?
[01:05] I think what we noticed was this sentiment and we felt it first ourselves, but
[01:12] we also started hearing it from the market, from our users, from our customers
[01:17] that we'd slowed down.
[01:19] And as a founder, as a CEO, that's the absolute last thing you want to hear.
[01:23] It's our job, after all, to speed things up.
[01:27] And when I asked people, what do they mean by slowing down?
[01:29] They didn't mean the product, of course, the product wasn't working any slower,
[01:33] but that the pace of delivery seemed to have slowed down.
[01:38] So I think to break this down, it's important to start by defining what we
[01:42] mean by a slowdown.
[01:43] There's the kind of slowdown that is unavoidable in certain spaces.
[01:47] And then there is the kind of slowdown that is quite avoidable.
[01:50] We actually had both.
[01:52] So starting with unavoidable slowdown, you can classify anything that you
[01:56] build in a company into one of two categories, solution deepening and market
[02:01] widening.
[02:02] Now, solution deepening means making your product better for its existing users,
[02:07] but not making it available to more users.
[02:10] Whereas market widening means making your product available to more users, but
[02:15] not making the product itself any better.
[02:18] And there are some spaces, there are some markets, there are
[02:21] some platforms where market widening is really fast and really easy.
[02:26] And there are some spaces, email is one of them, where market widening is
[02:30] really hard and really slow.
[02:32] And when we started, we had a great deal of focus.
[02:35] We only supported Gmail.
[02:36] We were only on the web.
[02:38] And in those early years, we could pour every ounce of R&D energy, every
[02:42] engineering dollar into solution deepening, making the product better for
[02:46] existing users.
[02:47] And of course, users loved it.
[02:48] It's how we got to product market fit.
[02:50] It's how most startups do.
[02:52] But at a certain point, almost every company then has to start investing
[02:56] in widening the market.
[02:58] For example, the market to people who will use a new Gmail front end, but
[03:03] without a mobile app does exist, but it is relatively small.
[03:08] And then this is something that every new email startup is going to learn
[03:11] sooner or later.
[03:13] In order to keep on growing, you are going to have to need to add an iOS app
[03:17] and then a Mac OS app and then a Windows app and then an Android app.
[03:20] And then you'll soon want to support Office 365, but that's not one thing.
[03:24] That's actually three things because you have to support Office 365 on desktop
[03:27] and then on iOS and then on Android.
[03:30] And that's all much easier said than done.
[03:32] I think we at Superhuman now know things about these APIs that literally no
[03:37] other company knows and I would not wish it upon my worst enemy.
[03:41] So fast forward to today and Superhuman now works wherever you do on every
[03:45] combination of Gmail, Outlook, Mac, Windows, web, iOS, Android.
[03:49] And this actually turns out to be a really great technology mode.
[03:52] Almost no other email app can claim this.
[03:54] It's taken many years of intense investment.
[03:57] And I think we'll touch on this later, but it's one of the main reasons why we
[04:00] can sell into the enterprise because we now know everyone can use it.
[04:04] But this is the hard part.
[04:05] When you're when you're doing that market widening, you're not solution
[04:09] deepening and so your perceived product velocity may decrease.
[04:13] You can avoid some of these things with some smart technology decisions,
[04:16] but mostly you just have to grind through it and it is worth it to get to the other side.
[04:21] Then there's the kind of slowdown that is affordable.
[04:25] And if I remember my answer to Richie's tweet, that was the kind I was talking about.
[04:30] And in that case, it was our management structure.
