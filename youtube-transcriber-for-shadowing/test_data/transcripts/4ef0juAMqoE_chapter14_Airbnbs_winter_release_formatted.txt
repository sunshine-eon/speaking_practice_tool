============================================================

Speaking of rowing in the same direction, you had a huge launch today. I know you wanted to talk about it, your winter release, and it kind of is the culmination of a lot of the things you're talking about. I'd love to hear just some of the stuff you're launching.

Let me just back up, Saleni. So you know this problem really well. One of the best things about Airbnb is that we're this marketplace where guests and hosts come together. We have all this unique inventory, and people list on Airbnb, and every home is one of a kind. There are seven million homes, and there's all the surprise and all the delight. The problem is that every home is one of a kind, and you often don't know what you're going to get. 

A lot of guests have described checking into Airbnb as a moment of truth, where when you open the door, you find out if the home is exactly the home that you booked. This turns out to be a big problem for people wanting to book an Airbnb. When we surveyed guests or people who don't use Airbnb, the number one hotel is not a special; they're not as unique. But the advantage they have is you know what you're going to get. You know exactly what you're going to get.

What we found is that reliability is Airbnb's Achilles heel, or at least it has been. With hotels, you know you're going to get a certain experience, but with Airbnb, you don't always know what you're going to get. So we asked ourselves, what if we could combine the uniqueness of Airbnb with the reliability that you've come to expect from hotels? And that's what we've done with guest favorites.

Guest favorites are homes that guests in our community love the most. We took 370 million reviews on Airbnb, plus millions of customer service tickets, and all the host cancellation data. We used all these signals to create the top 2 million homes in this collection that we call guest favorites, because these are the homes that guests rate the highest. We think this combines the uniqueness of Airbnb with the reliability you come to expect from hotels, and I can't imagine there are many use cases where you wouldn't want to book a guest favorite.

We think that's also part of this broader system of ratings and reviews. As you know, Airbnb is built on a system of trust, and we invented this new way for people to trust one another, at least at scale, through living together. We felt like the rating and review system could use a little bit of an upgrade, so we made some upgrades to the ratings and reviews.

The final thing, and this brings up another point I might mention, is we've completely overhauled the host tab. One of the most important things when you get to an Airbnb is that the listing is accurate. However, the problem is that a lot of host listings don't have all the details up to date. They might not perfectly describe their listing, they might not have filled out their amenities, and they might not have a photo tour. 

The reason for this, as we found in our research, is that hosts found it hard to manage their listings. It was hard to manage because it was designed as this hodgepodge thing by different teams over many years.
