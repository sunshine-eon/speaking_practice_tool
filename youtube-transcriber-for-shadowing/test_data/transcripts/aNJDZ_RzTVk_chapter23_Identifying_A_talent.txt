============================================================

[00:00] the designers are your plus somebody listening to this they may be wondering are my engineers a plus
[00:06] or not what comes to mind as ways that you could get a sense of this is a team that can operate in
[00:11] this way versus no we're never going to work in this way and maybe we should shift the way we
[00:16] work or I should go work somewhere else great question is that's very hard to identify a few
[00:22] things one is does the engineer want to win in the market does the engineer really care about
[00:34] winning or against competitors winning the hearts and minds of the customer
[00:40] do they understand the business context in which they operate by which they need to do that
[00:45] are they curious about how the company makes money about what customers love and don't love
[00:50] about what the most important project is and why it's important they asking you questions about
[00:57] the business outside of just the engineering domains are they able to execute on what they said they
[01:05] were going to execute without your help or do you actually need to feel like you need to be
[01:10] behind them are they the one actually like setting the pace asking you to keep up keep
[01:16] up with your specs keep up with your decisions like respond more more quickly to the things that
[01:22] are blocking them bringing more pms or more designers to to to do more things are they
[01:28] being proactive in like different channels where you think it's actually your job but
[01:32] actually they'll jump in anyways for example you know we have different slack channels with
[01:38] a bunch of people sometimes asking questions or raising issues or having blockers and you
[01:43] have engineers who are just like jumping in and like explaining how a feature works like getting
[01:48] the feedback and fixing a bug proactively and you may think well you know that's not the priority
[01:53] i need to control what the engineers are doing that's not your job actually that's not your job
[01:57] your job is to make sure that they're aligned with the long-term vision and that they can
[02:01] deliver what they've committed to but on top of that they can do whatever the hell they want
[02:05] and if they're taking on something that puts the things that they committed to at risk they'll
[02:09] communicate that so again that proactiveness that desire to help that desire to to improve
[02:15] that accountability on their product if their product isn't performing if their product has
[02:19] feedback are they doing it themselves or they need you to push them so that those are all like
[02:26] mentality and culture aspects i'm not even getting into the technical rigor and the quality
[02:32] of their systems and the velocity of code because i'm not a good judge of that that's not really
[02:36] my role but those are the things that i would immediately look at that i think is just fundamentally
[02:41] different in the engineering team that we built at ramp versus uh versus others and it's just a big
[02:46] part of the culture shift and the culture that we've been able to build that's an awesome answer
[02:51] and i think as a PM you often don't want your engineers and designers to have such strong
[02:56] opinions and to be so on top of everything like because there's just like oh no okay here's what
[03:00] i think we should actually do but engineers have all these opinions and what you're saying is
[03:04] that's what you want to lean into assuming you trust that they know what they're doing and
[03:10] can actually get things done and so it's kind of like a catch went to you a little bit but i think
[03:15] that's a that's a really unique culture and approach and so that's an awesome answer and look
[03:20] like there's drawbacks to that culture right where you get to like a radically empowered
[03:24] engineering team that thinks that they know the product better than the designer or the
[03:28] PM and they push back on the designs or they disagree with the PM but i'll take that
[03:32] culture any day compared to a culture where they're just you know taking things that face value
[03:37] and not challenging the thinking and not actually thinking from their own perspectives and it just
[03:43] it's sort of like you know i'll take someone on my team any day that challenges what i tell them
[03:47] to do or what i think is important and it's maybe a bit harder to manage but it'll make me think
[03:52] way deeper about what i'm asking them and what what i think is important and i'll grow as
[03:57] a manager much faster because of that i love it two final questions one around hiring when you're
[04:04] interviewing people what do you look for and what does ramp look for that maybe other companies
[04:08] don't value as much as they should or maybe overvalue what do you look for that you think is
[04:12] unique that helps you hire this a plus team
