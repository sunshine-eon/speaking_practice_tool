Time: 00:00 - 05:00
============================================================

[00:00] Let's talk about product market fit.
[00:01] You have to deliberately not act on the feedback of many of your early users.
[00:07] And this is at the same time as listening to people intensely and building what people want.
[00:13] That's what we're here to do is to make something that people want.
[00:16] But it can't be all people.
[00:17] And the question becomes, how do you listen to them?
[00:20] And then even of what they say, what do you pay attention to and what don't you?
[00:24] And the trick here is you're not doing what a lot of CEOs think they need to be doing with their time.
[00:29] A lot of CEOs think they need to spend time on hiring or work building.
[00:33] And you intentionally, I will spend time on product and marketing design.
[00:36] So this is a technique that I call the switch lock.
[00:39] And it's born out of the observation that your calendar says what you thought you were going to do.
[00:45] But it's really only your trail of work that describes what you actually did.
[00:50] How can we capture that?
[00:51] I came up with the following idea.
[00:53] What if I just did whatever the heck I wanted with the most pivotal moment in your career in your life?
[00:58] I learned the real secret behind morality.
[01:01] There is no such thing as a truly viral product.
[01:06] What then is the true secret?
[01:07] It is.
[01:11] Today, my guest is Rahul Vora.
[01:13] Rahul is the founder and CEO of Superhuman and one of the most thoughtful and insightful and articulate founders that I've met.
[01:22] As you'll see in our conversation, it's hard not to be captivated by Rahul's storytelling skills.
[01:27] And also his really insightful takes on how to build great products and teams.
[01:32] This episode is for anyone who's looking to build their product taste, help their teams move faster, learn how to think better from first principles,
[01:39] and also learn about Superhuman's very unique approach to building their company,
[01:43] including why they manually onboarded every single new user for years and why they decided to stop,
[01:48] why they ignored most of their customer feedback on their way to finding product market fit,
[01:52] and also how you can use his approach to finding product market fit for your own company.
[01:56] Also the power of game design in building great products, a very contrarian take on pricing strategy,
[02:02] what Rahul has learned about building scale products on top of AI and LLMs,
[02:06] and so much more.
[02:07] A huge thank you to Ed Sims, Conrad Irwin, Bill Trencher, and Garavora for suggesting questions and topics for this conversation.

[02:38] This episode is brought to you by Epo.
[02:41] Epo is a next generation AB testing and feature management platform
[02:45] built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams.
[02:49] Companies like Twitch, Muro, ClickUp, and DraftKings rely on Epo to power their experiments.
[02:55] Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features.
[03:01] And Epo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous, deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does.
[03:08] When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I left most was our experimentation platform,
[03:13] where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own.
[03:18] Epo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shape weeks off experiment time
[03:24] and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out of the box reporting
[03:28] that helps you avoid annoying, prolonged, analytic cycles.
[03:31] Epo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team,
[03:35] sparking new ideas for the AB testing flywheel.
[03:38] Epo powers experimentation across every use case, including product, growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing.
