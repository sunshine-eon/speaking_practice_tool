The email product, is that like an email client product, or is it for designing emails that you can then send through your products? It is for designing emails. So you can design an email, then take that code and pop it into any email platform that you use.

How do you think about the products you're going to expand to? I know there are trade secrets here, and you don't want to tell everyone where you're going next, but how do you approach determining your next steps? Our mission is to empower everyone to design anything with every ingredient in every language on every device, and we take those things very literally. We want to literally design anything and publish anywhere. We now print in over 50 countries around the world, and you can get it printed and delivered to your house. I actually did that while you were around here.

Oh, awesome! I wasn't planning this, but I had a print thing delivered to my house. Exactly! You just click print, and it pops up beautifully packaged at your door. I don't know how that works, but it did, and it was very cool. So, we are literally bringing these things to life. We're also launching 3D capabilities, and we will continue to enable everyone to design anything and publish anywhere. We've been doing that for a decade, and we'll continue to do that forever, using the latest technology to truly bring people's ideas to life.

This is helpful. If someone is concerned about Canva coming for their space, there are people designing things, right? That was design and also publishing. So, if you're doing any designing or publishing, watch out. From a macro perspective, there are creativity tools and productivity tools. Canva is literally smack bang in the middle of that Venn diagram of creativity and productivity, rather than making our customers choose between those two tool suites.

Something I wasn't planning on asking about, but I think it's on everyone's minds, is the competition with Figma and Adobe. There are a bunch of places we could go with this. One is at the beginning of the journey, where many founders try to figure out their wedge and specific niche. How did you think about that? How did you approach your early wedge of users? One of the most important things we did was not worry about competitors at all. We focused on identifying gaps in the market that we could uniquely fill and solving core problems that people had.

With our first company, that was Yearbooks in Australia. There weren't great tools, and Yearbook coordinators, who had no design experience, were thrown into designing something. We spoke to every single customer, provided over-the-phone tutorials, understood their pain points, and continuously gathered feedback to iterate and improve. A few years into Canva, one of the schools said, "I love this product so much! Can I use it to design newsletters?" They had all sorts of other things they wanted to use it for. We looked around and realized there was still nothing on the market that did what we were doing for all these other applications.

It was much more about identifying gaps in the market where people were experiencing pain points. If you can solve that pain point really well and in a way that people are willing to pay for, because it truly addresses a real issue, that sets you up for success. It’s better to focus on solving a small number of people's problems really well rather than trying to address a large number of problems superficially.

So, what I'm hearing is that you didn't overthink your ideal customer profile or your expansion strategy. Instead, you focused on people with unsolved problems that you kept seeing and aimed to solve them. Exactly that. If you take a problem-centered approach that helps people achieve something they want to do in real life, you're likely to be in a good spot, especially if it maps to a larger market. If it only solves one person's problem, that might not be a great company going forward. But if several people have that same problem, then you’re onto something.
