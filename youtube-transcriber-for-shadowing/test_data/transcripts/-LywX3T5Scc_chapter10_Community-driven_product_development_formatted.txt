Is actually really beneficial. I want to come back to this closing the loop process, let's say, that you have where you figure out what to build. A lot of your ideas come actually from the community. Talk about just that process and how many of your ideas actually came from your community.

Oh, it's one of my favorite things. We've been doing it for years now. We get more than a million requests from our community every year. We've got a whole incredible team that then tallies them, breaks them down, and delivers them to all of our product teams. Those actually get closed. This year, we've closed more than 200 loops. We know that each one of those things is going to be loved and needed by so many more people who don't bother to actually fill out the request form. 

So many things, from gradient text—like little things like gradient text—to really big things like our sheets product. There have just been countless products. In the early days with our AI products, we didn't release them to teachers because we knew there was a lot of hesitancy for teachers using AI in the classroom. We got so many requests from teachers saying, "Can I please use this magic right in the classroom?" So with them, we unlocked that and put on safety controls for teachers. 

It's just constant, actually. It's just part of our product process. I think there's two parts to product: one is building the future towards the mission and the mission tellers, as I was saying before, and the other is actually listening to our community and building what they want. I think that those are the two core pieces of product in my mind.

The closing of the loop comes in so many different forms, like the explicit asks. The other thing that we double down on all the time is user testing and watching people use it. If people hesitate clicking a button or don’t quite understand how something works, it's amazing to me how you can find 10 random people on the internet, and they can give such astute feedback that is so representative for such a large number of people. 

I've personally run hundreds, if not thousands, of user tests myself, and it's been deeply embedded in our product teams also. Wow. That must be really stressful for someone looking at a test of Canva trying to try someone when you're in the room.

Actually, we do it all online. The ones I've run are typically online, so people are so much more frank, I think, when it's just them and their camera. They tell you really how it is. Is there a tool or a kind of process there that you find really helpful? I don't know if you want to name names of products or anything like that, but is there something that you find helpful and useful?

Yeah, we use a lot of usertesting.com. I find that super, super valuable. All right, go user test.
