Okay. Anything else? And if there's like more than one more, definitely share. But any other really interesting lessons or wrong turns or insights?

You know, I talked about streak freezes and we've done a lot with streak freezes, but I think if you're going to make flexibility a thing, it's probably also useful to think about how to celebrate perfection. Um, and so we have a feature that we have. It is the simplest thing in the world. It's called perfect streak. And it's just, if you don't use a streak freeze for a few days, we make your streak look gold and we make your little progress bar on the calendar just look a little bit nicer. There's no reward for doing it. You don't get anything other than this nice little indication, and it is awesome. It is, it is, it is a simple feature. It is ultra not complex and it is really powerful, not only for getting users to, you know, as a bit of a reward to be, "Hey, you know, get to seven days, you know, without using a streak freeze and, you know, your streak becomes perfect," but it's also a really nice indication of users who aren't using streak freezes.

Here is the thing that if you, uh, you know, if you don't use a streak freeze, which again, candidly, I would love for you never to use a streak freeze, if you don't use a streak freeze, your streak will stay, you know, perfect. It's funny, we actually just, you know, we're constantly responding to bug reports about the streak. You know, it is, I swear to God, we have the best infrastructure around this feature because it is so important. Um, we had an employee who lost her, like a four-month perfect streak. Uh, and, you know, it was a big deal for her because she, you know, did her lesson as she was crossing an international deadline. There was like a bunch of stuff going on that was just kind of weird in her back end, but like people start to care about perfection as much as they do their streak. And, you know, for that person, it was, it was, it was a big deal when they lost their perfect streak.

And so, you know, this is just an example of, look, if you're gonna go after flexibility, um, which is good, it's finding a way to pull users back into perfection is a really important counterweight to have. What I'm imagining is you guys need like an Amazon-style chat bot that just gives you the streak back. It's just like, "Okay, here we go." 

We have very much, so we have, if people lose their streak, you know, there are ways to get in contact with us, but we've actually thought about that where it's like, "Okay, we should just like build a self-service feature." And if you're, if we think that your excuse is good enough, whatever, we'll just, yeah, yeah, because again, it's for us. I'd much rather have you be on, you know, be on a streak than...
