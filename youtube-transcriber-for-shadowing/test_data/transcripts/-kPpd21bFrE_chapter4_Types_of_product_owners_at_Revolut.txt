============================================================

[00:00] I love this because it's so fun just to learn about such different ways of operating.
[00:04] Another fact that I saw is that there's two types of product donors.
[00:08] There's a UX product donor and then there's a technical product donor.
[00:12] We actually have three.
[00:14] Three.
[00:14] The third type becomes increasingly more important.
[00:19] The first type is UX product owners.
[00:23] Then there are technical product owners and then there are data science product owners.
[00:27] UX product owners are the ones who work on consumer facing part of the product.
[00:37] Usually they have a great taste for things and they understand what constitutes
[00:48] UX that will work and which things will not work.
[00:53] So they also have these expertise in the industry.
[00:59] Then tech product owners, they are the ones who delve deepest into details.
[01:06] Usually those are former engineers who grew into making decisions and driving business.
[01:16] And the data science product owners are usually former data scientists who decided to grow into
[01:24] management positions but they're still very hands-on.
[01:27] And you know what?
[01:28] There are way more things that are common to each of these three specializations.
[01:34] So what we see sometimes is people just shifting them because I would say that
[01:41] what defines the specialization is probably 5-10-15% while 85-90% is common to each one of them.
[01:50] And those things are, so first of all, being a great problem solver and have a great linear
[02:02] thinking but also have a creative approach towards nonlinear problems.
[02:07] Then building this context for customer and building empathy towards customer and translating
[02:16] it into the team.
[02:18] Then going down to details very, very deep because in our domain there are no obvious things.
[02:29] And you need to get to the root cause of the problem really, really deep to understand,
[02:36] okay, what will work and what will not work.
[02:40] And that means that you also need to be quite technical.
[02:42] Even if you're an expert, you still need to often go as deep as sitting with engineers and reading code.
[02:51] And then I would also emphasize importance of business acumen because we tend to measure
[03:03] and quantify product performance a lot and you need to understand, okay, what things will we
[03:09] build that will drive eventually that business metric and that target.
[03:13] So I love this idea of the product owners having to go really deep.
[03:16] I think a lot of people hearing this, they think they can go deep, go deep, really understand
[03:20] the details of what they're working on.
[03:22] I'm curious if there's an example that's illustrative of just what you actually mean here.
[03:27] For example, to provide the best possible product in every country of presence,
[03:34] we need to have necessary licenses.
[03:37] In Europe, it means that we need to launch local branches of our European bank.
[03:43] For example, the branch for France, a branch for Germany, or a branch for Italy.
[03:48] To launch a branch, you need to fully comply with all necessary regulation.
[03:53] You need to report necessary data on customers to various regulators and authorities.
[04:02] You need to register with local payment systems.
[04:07] And each of these things, they have a lot of projects nested within.
[04:15] We have a very lean team of just a few people who need to scope everything
[04:19] and do it at a scale of 50 countries.
[04:23] So the way we do it is we go very deep on example of each of these projects.
[04:29] For example, we launched a branch in Ireland, we launched a branch in Netherlands,
[04:33] then we reverse engineered what was the best process to do it.
[04:39] And then we went back up on top level and we said, okay,
[04:42] but what's the ideal framework of doing it at scale?
[04:47] And then we formalized it into a process, really like an algorithmic process
[04:52] with steps and quality gates and assaynees and what people do we need to hire
[04:59] and how soon do we need to start doing that before we want to launch
[05:03] a new country.
[05:06] And then so it's not only going deep, but also being flexible, you know,
[05:10] and like doing this switch between zooming in very deep and then
[05:17] raising on the level of helicopter view and then understanding, okay,
[05:23] so these seemed very, very complex in details.
[05:27] But then when you zoom out, how can we simplify it and build a robust process around it,
[05:32] which is scalable?
[05:34] And that's something that we have to do a lot.
[05:37] As you're talking and we go through this chat, I'm keeping kind of track of what I think is
[05:41] most contributing to your alumni product owners, product managers becoming so successful.
[05:47] So a couple of things so far that I think are probably contributing to this is one is
[05:51] just having a lot of ownership over what they're building,
[05:54] which leads to building skills to start companies and become leaders at other companies.
[05:58] So these product owners that you have are just like own a lot and are essentially
[06:02] GMs of the of whatever product they're working on.
[06:05] And then there's this depth in complexity where you have to really get good at understanding
[06:09] a problem really deeply.
[06:11] I imagine many of these people go on to work on something like that layer somewhere else
[06:16] because they've spent all this time or they just get really good at dealing with complex
[06:20] many layered problems.
