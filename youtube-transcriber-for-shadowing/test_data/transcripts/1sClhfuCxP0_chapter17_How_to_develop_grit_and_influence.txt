============================================================

[00:00] Maybe spending a little more time here so smart, you're probably not going to be able to do a lot about
[00:04] in terms of grit or influence. Is there anything you can share about
[00:08] what you've seen most helps people develop at these skills
[00:12] other than just doing the job for a while and starting to get better at this?
[00:16] I think even smartness, I think 80% of that smartness
[00:20] I think is something that's very achievable. You don't need to be
[00:24] outstanding at that. Domain knowledge for example is something just like
[00:28] an average smart person with no domain knowledge versus you with
[00:32] armed with a lot of knowledge around domain and so on can already take you there
[00:36] where you can take better decisions. I think first one is more about decision making, problem identification,
[00:40] problem solving and all of that. I think that really can be developed at least to a level
[00:44] where you are very effective. Drive I think is
[00:48] probably the hardest to coach, probably the hardest. I've not seen people
[00:52] with less drive actually eventually turning out with
[00:56] a lot of drive etc but they can be inspired
[01:00] and I think you need to be a person who can think about it that way
[01:04] but the third one influences I think like there's no negotiation
[01:08] it helps you need to really think that I have to be good at this one.
[01:12] There's another framework that linear wanted to talk about
[01:16] when I look at product leadership engine and how do you think about
[01:20] different people and so on. When is it a product
[01:24] management problem or your problem with the company?
