Ooh, I love it. Okay, I'm glad we talked on that. Okay, back on track. The second bucket you described is following up on results. How do you, does it just do that? Is there anything more you can add there? I put reminders in my calendar. I mean, yeah, it's just do that. But like if you're launching a product, usually, you know, you release something and you have that initial push of a couple of weeks where you're finding bugs and maybe you're pulling metrics and everyone remembers it. 

Then I would remember two weeks after that, a month after that, six months after that, put a reminder in your calendar to check your dashboard or check the metrics or check whatever it is that you were doing. A, you won't forget and then share them with whoever might care about it. And it's as simple as that. 

And is the reason this is one of the three things you think are most consistent across great PMs that it helps your manager see you like, wow, Maggie's so on top of everything? Or is it more that you learn from that experience and drive more impact? Or is it both? It's definitely both. I'm not gonna pretend like if you're just great at your job quietly that you're gonna get what you want, right? You're not just if you're toiling in the background, doing a great job, getting results. 

If you have a great manager, maybe you'll be successful. Great managers are few and far between, and I'm of the opinion that I never wanted to rely on someone else to get what I wanted. And so I would always make sure to share that, always make sure to share my progress because I didn't wanna leave it up to chance that someone would notice. So I would suggest doing it for both reasons. 

And that's one of those things that like, people wanna pretend that everything's perfect and we're all great and we're always gonna get what we want and always gonna get that promotion, but you have to work for it.
