============================================================

[00:00] You can also buy a streak, right?
[00:02] Like with money, is that, that's a feature, right?
[00:04] Yeah, you can buy, and it's funny,
[00:05] this is also something that we buy at all the,
[00:07] yeah, you can buy, or freeze, sorry, not a streak.
[00:09] Yeah, so you can buy a streak freeze,
[00:11] and the way it works is you can buy gems,
[00:13] and then you can use those gems to buy a streak.
[00:17] And this is something we wrestle with,
[00:18] we're actively working on an experiment right now
[00:21] that's having a small hit revenue,
[00:23] but it's a really nice one for retention.
[00:25] And I think it's actually worth thinking about
[00:27] from day one as you're building a streak,
[00:29] do you see this more as a monetization feature,
[00:31] or do you see this more as a retention feature?
[00:33] What's the role of monetization in this?
[00:34] What's the role of retention?
[00:36] And I think for us, it started out much more organically,
[00:38] and so we have a lot of like monetization hooks
[00:40] that again, as the retention PM,
[00:42] I would love to get rid of.
[00:44] But again, it's sort of part of how the streak works
[00:46] right now, and so we always have this tension of,
[00:49] hey, if we start to make it harder to buy streak freezes,
[00:53] then fewer people buy them, buy gems to buy them,
[00:56] and so there's this more convoluted series
[00:59] of impacts that happen.
[01:01] Yeah, I love that.
[01:03] People wanting to buy streak freezes
[01:05] like the ultimate sign of how much streaks matter.
[01:09] Yeah, streak freezes is the other big one
[01:12] that we've recently demonetized
[01:15] or introduced a free option for
[01:17] is getting back a lost streak.
[01:20] So used to losing streak,
[01:22] we had a feature in the day,
[01:24] back in the day called streak repair,
[01:26] we'd give you your streak back, you had to pay gems.
[01:28] But we found out worked way better
[01:30] was a feature called earn back.
[01:32] And this is basically where you would have
[01:35] to do a certain number of lessons
[01:36] as long as you came back within a window
[01:39] soon after losing your streak,
[01:41] do a few lessons and we just give you your streak back.
[01:43] And it was such a retention winner.
[01:45] And again, what we thought about was
[01:48] it feels like you've earned it so much more
[01:50] when you've done, like you deserve
[01:52] to have your streak back.
[01:53] We haven't cheapen the streak
[01:56] because you've done something.
[01:57] And in this sense, this idea of cheapening the streak
[02:00] is something like from a philosophical philosophy
[02:02] of the streak, from a philosophical level,
[02:04] we wrestle with all the time of,
[02:08] cool, we're giving out more streak freezes.
[02:09] At what point do we cross the line
[02:11] and users start to realize their streak means nothing.
[02:14] Now, everything that we've seen,
[02:15] users are totally cool with using streak freezes
[02:18] and still thinking about their streak
[02:19] is this meaningful thing.
[02:20] But my colleague, Antonia,
[02:22] who made that awesome cross stitch for me,
[02:25] she is sort of the keeper for us
[02:26] of the sanctity of the streak.
[02:28] And a lot of times as we,
[02:29] and I think this is really important to have
[02:31] as you're thinking about building your streak,
[02:32] you can almost always get engagement wins
[02:34] up to a certain point by just cheapening the streak,
[02:36] making it easier to extend,
[02:38] letting users have more flexibility.
[02:41] But you kind of got to hold the line at some point.
[02:43] It's not clear where that line is.
[02:45] And once you talk about one-way doors or two-way doors,
[02:49] there's a point where you go too far
[02:51] and it's a one-way door.
[02:52] And all of a sudden, those users,
[02:54] those nine million users on one-year streaks
[02:56] don't care about their streak anymore.
[02:57] And that is, I don't know, again, retention, PM perspective.
[03:01] That'd be an extinction level event for us.
[03:02] I don't want all of these users
[03:04] just not caring about their streak.
[03:06] And so to have somebody who is invested
[03:08] in the sanctity of the streak,
[03:11] and you know, for us, it's Antonia and Luis,
[03:14] he's very good about this,
[03:16] is really important just so you make sure
[03:17] you don't go too far.
[03:19] That's an awesome insight.
