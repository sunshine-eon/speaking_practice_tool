============================================================

[00:00] There's really an example of a phrase you found really effective in either Swiggy or Jupiter or
[00:05] Flipkart or anything. Here's a really quick example of something that had a big impact on
[00:09] either simplifying the value prop or if you don't have an example top of mind,
[00:14] what was the impact you saw from implementing some of these ideas?
[00:17] I'm talking about a phrase that I'm now used with with product managers a lot to
[00:22] kind of simplify how they should be thinking. I think one thing is, and that's not only for
[00:26] the consumers but even like how we operate. We are product managers and we're in the business of
[00:31] influence. Users are doing something and now we want them to do something else. Our engineers
[00:37] are doing something and now we want to influence them into building something fast. Our leadership
[00:42] has some plans where to influence them to essentially look at a plan and like basically
[00:48] sign off and do something else. We are in the business of influence and you are doing
[00:53] this all the time internally, otherwise you are anyway not successful even in shipping.
[00:58] Now we have to extend this to our users and really think about it from that point of view.
[01:03] So you are a full stack influencer and not only an external influencer,
[01:07] so you've got to think more like sales, more like marketing, more like influencers.
[01:12] One of the most important skills are product managers influencing people on their team
[01:15] and I like the point that you're also trying to influence your user and that's interesting.
[01:19] Just more reason to get really good at influence. So I actually have a newsletter about how to get
[01:24] better influence based on Frodo Baggins and Lord of the Rings. We'll link to that in the show notes.
