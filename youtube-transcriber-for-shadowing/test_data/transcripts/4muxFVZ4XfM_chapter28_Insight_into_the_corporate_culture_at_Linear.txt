============================================================

[00:00] to kind of close out our conversation, just a couple more broad questions. You have a pretty
[00:06] unique culture at Linear. And I know one fun thing that you do is you have this kind of baking
[00:10] competition. Can you talk about that and what do you do there?
[00:15] Yeah. So since we are like a fully remote and distributed company, so we have people in
[00:21] Europe and US like a lot of like kind of like group gatherings are kind of challenging
[00:27] like remote group sessions are kind of challenging because the time zones are so different.
[00:33] So like some of the basic things like happy hours is not really like,
[00:37] like it doesn't really work that well. And also like Zoom happy hours is probably not that fun
[00:41] anyway. So what we, I think a lot of people in the company watch the Great British Baking Show.
[00:47] And so we decide like maybe we do something like that like where basically we would just
[00:53] pick a recipe. Firstly it was like baking. Now we expanded to cooking recipes too.
[00:58] And so we just pick a recipe that is like somewhat reasonable to do in a few hours,
[01:05] in a couple hours. And it doesn't like require like tons of equipment or skill or something.
[01:11] And then we just tell people I go buy the ingredients, use the company card,
[01:16] everyone has a company card. And then like hop on Zoom on this day. And for me, it's usually like
[01:23] since I'm in California, it's like 8am in the morning. So we start like that baking or cooking
[01:29] then. So we've made things like like a roll cake and lemon meringue pie. And we made some
[01:38] like pastel net data, which is like Portuguese like pastry. And
[01:43] and then like we just hop on the Zoom, everyone's like doing their thing, following the recipe.
[01:48] And then like some nice people have like questions like, Hey, I'm, I don't know,
[01:52] stuck with this or like, my dough looks weird. Like, does your dough look like this? And people
[01:57] can kind of like help each other. And then also like chit chat about whatever random things
[02:02] at the same time. And then like we do the thing and then we everyone takes pictures and
[02:07] posts this on this like Slack channel and it's like what they what they achieve. Then
[02:10] I think we have like kind of friendly competitions, like who did it better and like or who did it
[02:15] best. So people sometimes put a lot of effort into the into the decorations and and visuals. So
[02:20] in a way, it's again, like a craft thing that we do. It's it's like, I think baking and cooking
[02:27] and this kind of things is also a craft. So we liked it that way. And yeah, we've been
[02:32] basically doing it quarterly since the beginning of the company. And yeah, the latest thing
[02:39] we were a little bit like, I think, didn't have that much time. So we decided to do like
[02:45] easier thing, which is like a summer drink recipe. So I think it's it was like people
[02:49] made like matcha drinks and and so I'm like, coconut drinks or like iced tea or something.
[02:57] So even that was kind of like interesting to do.
[02:59] Have you ever won one of these competitions yourself?
[03:02] We don't know if we like declare winners that much. But I do think like I do, since I'm a designer,
[03:11] I do have some advantages on the on the visual presentation. So I think that I generally do
[03:17] well on that. And obviously, that's like, with this remote competition, it's that's the
[03:21] only thing you can really like, look for. It's not not necessarily about the taste or the
[03:27] texture because you can't really taste it through the zoom
