============================================================

[00:00] Let's talk about hiring then. Is there anything unique about how you approach hiring, sourcing,
[00:06] looking for people, what you look for in people that you think might be contributing to your
[00:10] alumni being so successful down the road?
[00:12] I think everyone is striving for talented, skillful, smart people and experienced people.
[00:22] Value is way more raw intellect and this unquenched hunger to build things rather than experience.
[00:31] So let me maybe, you know, like bring an example. Imagine, we also this like you hire a great
[00:39] experienced professional with amazing regalia of achieving a lot of things.
[00:47] But then what I see in product, the adoption curve is usually longer than in other functions.
[00:57] Because product owners by definition are the ones who, you know, who are the experts in that
[01:04] domain and they know those intricacies of how product is built and how it's used.
[01:10] So what we see from these professionals is they still take a lot of time to ramp up.
[01:15] And sometimes they also take time to adapt to new culture or worse, they just rest on their laurels.
[01:25] But you already have like super inflated expectations and usually the compensation is,
[01:30] by the way, quite high and which adds up to these expectations.
[01:34] So and I myself after conducting maybe four or five hundred interviews with product owners
[01:42] at Revolut, I also see this. Unfortunately, professionals with a lot of years of experience
[01:51] from established companies, they don't have this, this strong urge to change status quo,
[02:03] which, by the way, will require, you know, total tears and sweat. And that's why
[02:13] what even if a candidate doesn't have a lot of years of experience, but they love building things,
[02:21] they've done it, they worked with engineers, maybe by the way, maybe in their own startup
[02:27] or one of the best profiles that I've seen is a tech co-founder. So I think that's probably the
[02:39] best way to boost career is to, you know, to go and find something, working in startup,
[02:45] building things yourself or with a very small team, working all different
[02:50] areas because in startup you have to work in all different areas. And then these kind of people,
[02:56] they really thrive at Revolut. And even if they don't have a lot of years of experience, they actually
[03:05] attack a specific problem, they have a sense of what can cause customer pain, and they are very
[03:16] fast moving to solve it quickly. And then that's how they get appreciation from everyone around.
[03:22] The team starts respecting these people because they solve some specific problem,
[03:25] and then they take another problem, they solve it, and then they take another, and that's how
[03:31] they grow in the company. Essentially what I'm hearing is you hire kind of more junior,
[03:36] super high raw, intellect driven, passionate, how to just grow hungry people. And this explains why
[03:45] so many people have so get promoted so much more that leave Revolut because they start,
[03:50] they're earlier in their career, and you help them learn all these skills, ownership, depth,
[03:55] understanding, working in complex environments, building amazing products. So this all makes a
[04:00] lot of sense. Is there anything you figured out about where to find these people? Because this
[04:04] is the dream, hire amazingly smart people that are super driven that nobody knows about yet,
[04:08] and then make them awesome. Have you found anything about where to source and find these folks?
[04:14] So the way we work, we have weekly catch ups with the recruitment team. So essentially they are
[04:22] also a team that runs in sprints. So every sprint we define what do we want to focus on,
[04:29] which areas, which companies. One of the great sources is actually looking into products and
[04:37] depths that we love ourselves. So if someone built a great product, then it's likely a high performer.
[04:45] So usually we provide some great products in specific areas that are more important for us
[04:52] to the sourcing team and they just try to source targeting those companies. It could be also
[04:59] different areas. It could be even schools, like good schools. So it varies from sprint to sprint.
[05:05] That makes sense. There's Gokul had this really good piece of advice. I think it was on the podcast,
[05:09] if not he tweeted about it, where you look at like there's like successful companies,
[05:13] but then there's also like what function in that company is the key to their success.
[05:18] And so you want to go like a company A for sales, company B for customer support,
[05:22] company C for design. And so it sounds like that's kind of the way you guys think about it a little
[05:27] bit. Very cool. Okay, we're I love how we're uncovering and we're uncovering this mystery.
