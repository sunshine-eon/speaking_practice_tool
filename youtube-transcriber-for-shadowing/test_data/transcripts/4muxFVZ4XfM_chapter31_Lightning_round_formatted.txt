============================================================

Awesome. What a cool peek at something coming out soon. Or maybe all by the time this comes out. And with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got a bunch of questions for you. Are you ready? 

Yeah, I'm ready. 

All right. Well, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people? Time was "A Pattern Language" by Christopher Alexander. He wasn't really an architect, but I think he taught in Berkeley. He has interesting thoughts about building things. He focuses on buildings and towns and these kinds of spaces, but I think there are a lot of ideas that are also interesting for building software. 

The other book that I like is "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" because it talks about the quality of things. I think that's one of the main themes of the book. The thing is, quality is so hard to define. If you actually start thinking about it, it's like, how do you define it? It's really hard to pin down. But when you try something or see it, you kind of know if it's quality or not. 

What are some recent movies or TV shows you've really enjoyed? I think the movie I liked most is probably "John Wick 4." It feels like, obviously, there's no real story in that movie, but I think it's very true to its nature. I also recently started watching "Silo" on Apple TV, and I kind of like it. It's a good mystery, and it reminds me of the Fallout game, so I enjoy it that way too. 

I actually read the "Silo" books and was really excited for the show to come out. But we mentioned this on a previous podcast: the show has so little to do with the actual books. The core ideas are the same, but there are all these stories they just made up for the show. I kind of stopped watching because it wasn't what I was hoping for. But maybe I need to check the books later. Once I watch that show, I definitely want to read the books. There are three of them, and only the first one is actually good. The others aren't that great, and I probably shouldn't have read them because they went off the rails a bit. 

Anyway, next question: what is a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates when you're interviewing them? I usually like to ask, "What is the candidate most proud of and why?" It could be about their professional life or otherwise. I think it gives you a little indication of what the person values and how they think about things. It's always nice for people to share something they think they did really well, and we can spend time on that versus just asking something more negative. 

What are some favorite products you've discovered that you really, really like? I'm not sure if I discovered them recently, but I've been in this home office and installing some of these Hue lights. I really like them because throughout the day, I can have harsher lighting when I'm in meetings. Then in the evening, I can change the temperature to something more red or orange. It's nice to transition spaces like that—okay, now I'm working, and now I'm doing something else. You can use the lights to indicate that. 

That is so cool. Do you automate the schedule, or do you manually change the color? 

Yeah, I just manually change it. I have scenes set up in my home app, like a night scene and a day scene. I just click that button, and it changes the lights. 

That is extremely cool. I'm going to try that myself. 

What is a favorite life motto that you like to repeat to yourself or share with people—something you come back to a lot? "Go slow to go fast" is important for me. Sometimes people have a tendency to rush into things, especially in startups, but in other places too. I think urgency is important, but sometimes there's too much urgency, and you end up rushing things. What happens is that you rush it, and then you need to come back to fix it. I like to think that you should take some time to actually think about it and what you're going to do, and then do it. In the end, it's going to be faster that way than going back and forth fixing things. 

What is the most valuable lesson that your mom or dad taught you? I think it's about respecting people and things. Respecting people is pretty obvious, but I think you should also take good care of the things you have. When you use them, you should clean them or put them away so they're ready for the next time. Rather than treating things like they're trash or not valuable, you should treat them as if they are valuable. 

Final question: you were born in Finland and grew up there. What is a Finnish food that people should definitely try to get as soon as they can? One is salmon soup. It might sound weird—a fish soup—but it's a creamy soup with potatoes, carrots, and other things. It has a slightly sweet flavor to it. You can make it yourself at home, or if you go to Finland, there are probably a few restaurants that offer it. 

Okay, amazing. Is that something we could get here, or do you have to go to Finland to get it? 

I don't think I've ever seen it here in the U.S. in any restaurant, but it's not very hard to make it yourself if you Google recipes. You just need some salmon, basic spices, and cream. 

All right, next episode, we're going to do a cooking show with Kari. Kari, thank you so much for being here. You're building a very special company in a really unique way, and I think many founders and product builders can learn a ton from watching you operate in the business that you're building. So again, thank you so much for being here. 

Two final questions: where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, maybe ask you some more questions? And how can listeners be useful to you? 

Yeah, so I'm on Twitter under my name, Kari Sarnen, and we also have the Linear account, which I think is interesting. That's at Linear. I hope everyone can check out Linear and see if it could work for them in their company. If they want to try it out with their team, we can help set it up and understand how to use the product. 

Awesome. And it's just linear.app, right? Is that the URL? 

Yes. 

Awesome. Okay. Easy peasy. Amazing. Kari, again, thank you so much for being here. Bye everyone.
