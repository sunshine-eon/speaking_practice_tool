[00:00] Okay. Anything else? And if there's like more than one more, definitely share.
[00:03] But any other really interesting lessons or wrong turns or insights?
[00:07] You know, I talked about streak freezes and we've done a lot with streak
[00:10] freezes, but I think if you're going to make flexibility a thing, it's
[00:13] probably also useful thinking about how do you celebrate perfection.
[00:17] Um, and so we have a feature that we have.
[00:20] It is the simplest thing in the world.
[00:21] It's called perfect streak.
[00:22] And it's just, if you don't use a streak freeze for a few days, we
[00:26] make your streak look gold and we make your little progress bar on the
[00:29] calendar, um, just look a little bit nicer.
[00:31] There's no reward for doing it.
[00:33] You don't get anything other than this nice little indication and it is awesome.
[00:38] It is, it is, it is a simple feature.
[00:40] It is ultra not complex and it is really powerful, not only for getting
[00:46] users to, you know, as, as a bit of a reward to be, Hey, you know, get to
[00:50] seven days, you know, without using a streak freeze and, you know, your
[00:53] streak becomes perfect, but it's also a really nice indication of users
[00:57] who aren't using streak freezes.
[00:59] Here is the thing that if you, uh, you know, if you don't use a streak
[01:03] freeze, which again, candidly, I would love for you never to use a streak
[01:06] freeze, if you don't use a streak freeze, your streak will stay, you know,
[01:10] perfect.
[01:10] It's funny, we actually just, you know, we're constantly, you know,
[01:14] responding to bug reports, uh, about the streak, you know, it is, I
[01:18] swear to God, we, we have that, we have the best infrastructure around
[01:21] this feature because it is so important.
[01:23] Um, we had an employee who lost her, like a four month perfect streak.
[01:28] Uh, and, you know, it was a big deal for her because she, you know, and
[01:32] because she like did her lesson as she was crossing international
[01:34] deadline, there was like a bunch of stuff going on that was like, it was
[01:36] just kind of weird in her back end, but like people start to care
[01:39] about perfection as much as they do their streak.
[01:42] And, you know, for that person, it was, it was, it was a big deal
[01:45] when they lost their perfect streak.
[01:46] And so, you know, this is just an example of, look, if you're
[01:48] gonna, if you're gonna go after flexibility, um, which is good,
[01:52] it's finding a way to pull users back into perfection is a really
[01:57] important counterweight to have.
[01:58] What I'm imagining is you guys need like an Amazon style chat
[02:00] bot that just gives you the streak back.
[02:02] It's just like, okay, here we go.
[02:05] We have very much, so we have, if people lose their streak, you
[02:08] know, there, there, there's ways to get in contact with us, but
[02:10] we've actually thought about that where it's like, okay, we
[02:12] should just like build a self-service feature.
[02:15] And if you're, if we think that your excuse is good enough,
[02:18] whatever, we'll just, yeah, yeah, because again, it's for us.
[02:21] I'm much rather than you be on, you know, be on a streak than
