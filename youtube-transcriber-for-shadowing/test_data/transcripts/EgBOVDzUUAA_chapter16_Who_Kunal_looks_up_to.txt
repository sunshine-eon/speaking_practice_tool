============================================================

[00:00] I'm curious who you look up to in business, either in India and outside India, who comes
[00:07] to mind where you're like, I really inspired and inspired by these folks.
[00:11] I often tell people that I hate the word favorite because it tells me to become limited in my
[00:16] mind.
[00:17] So I stay away from being favorite, but I learn all the time from everybody and there
[00:23] are so many people to learn across the world and in history, in recent past, and every
[00:30] time you will discover fascinating extraordinary things about them.
[00:36] So I don't think I have a person.
[00:39] I am this person about how did they solve this hard problem?
[00:43] So many of the things that we started doing recently and not very ritualistic about it
[00:47] so far is I ask myself and my key reportees every month, we go around the table and ask
[00:56] ourselves what are the hardest problems we solved last month?
[01:01] And it's very hard to come up with an answer.
[01:05] And if you do this to the product leaders, just go around and ask what are the hard
[01:10] problems you solved last month, you will realize that we all stay very busy and
[01:15] displacement is hard.
[01:16] But if you notice extraordinary successful people, they will have a lot more content to
[01:22] talk about every month, every quarter because they are obsessed about making that big displacement
[01:31] and does not come by being busy.
[01:36] And that's another thing that you cannot chase the big thing.
[01:39] You don't see a crocodile being busy.
[01:41] You see a crocodile just waiting patiently at the watering hole for that best meal and
[01:47] have the deadliest bite for that.
[01:50] So the beautiful definition of predators I read was the one who burns the least amount
[01:55] of calories to earn the most amount of calories.
[02:00] So how do you become that?
[02:01] And I think when I meet people who are extraordinary at that and it comes in all shapes and
[02:05] forms, I learn something from them.
[02:08] So in these meetings you have, are you judging people's success based on how many hard problems
[02:14] they solve?
[02:15] Now that they've heard this, they're going to be like, I need more.
[02:17] Because if you're a senior, what is the role of a senior person?
[02:22] You have to be the chief problem solver.
[02:25] I love that.
[02:26] I often think of leaders as a professional firefighter, so just endless fire to put
[02:31] out.
