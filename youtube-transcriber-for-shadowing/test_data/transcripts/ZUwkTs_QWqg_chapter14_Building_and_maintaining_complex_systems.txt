============================================================

[35:32] You've kind of touched on this idea of a complex system,
[35:35] and I wanna spend a little bit more time there.
[35:37] So, LinkedIn is, as you said, very, very complicated.
[35:40] There's all these marketplaces within marketplaces.
[35:44] There's so many customers you gotta make happy.
[35:47] They all have to work together.
[35:49] I'm just curious what you've learned about building
[35:52] and maintaining a complex ecosystem like that.
[35:55] So, it's a fantastic question,
[35:57] and it's, first of all, I just openly think,
[36:00] first of all, just career-wise,
[36:01] always been drawn to that.
[36:02] I think, as many, we talk about product as a whole, right?
[36:06] We always talk about it as a whole,
[36:07] but there's many different things you can build,
[36:09] many different types of things,
[36:10] and then we kind of go,
[36:11] maybe there's hardware and software, consumer goods.
[36:13] I actually try to kind of think about products
[36:15] by their complexity curve a lot.
[36:17] I think that the skills you need to manage
[36:19] a complicated kind of ecosystem
[36:21] versus maybe the skills you need to design,
[36:23] something that's less interconnected or quite different.
[36:25] And I will get to the details,
[36:27] maybe what I mean in a minute,
[36:29] but I do think LinkedIn is a particularly complicated place,
[36:31] and I do think that the skill sets that you think through
[36:34] and you try to manage
[36:35] are in a complicated ecosystem or quite different.
[36:37] So, maybe some tactics that can help if it's something
[36:40] that's really important.
[36:41] Yeah, let's do it.
[36:42] You know, one of the things that I often think about
[36:45] is this concept of cause and effect, right?
[36:47] Like, if you have non-interconnected things,
[36:50] it's actually quite easy not to have to think about that.
[36:52] You made something people love,
[36:54] and you know, I wrote a children's book not too long ago,
[36:58] and it was fun.
[36:59] It was awesome to write.
[37:00] Once it was done, it was kind of done,
[37:02] and it was out there and it was able to go.
[37:04] And that's a little bit different than here, right?
[37:06] If you kind of make a change, like open to work,
[37:09] all of a sudden you're thinking through the perception
[37:11] of someone on the other side, what is that gonna do?
[37:13] Are they gonna use the platform less or more?
[37:15] Are you thinking about customers?
[37:17] What are they gonna do with that data?
[37:18] Are they gonna, to your point,
[37:19] receive someone in a different way or not?
[37:21] You have to think through a second and third,
[37:23] and maybe even fourth or third of effects,
[37:25] and kind of manage that as you go through.
[37:27] And I think that is something we really pride ourselves on,
[37:29] is how do we start thinking through these different things,
[37:31] and how do we start measuring them as we go?
[37:33] And that is one.
[37:35] The second thing I actually think is
[37:36] it does lead to your point a lot.
[37:38] You need a different kind of decision-making mechanism,
[37:40] because there's a lot more ties in the ecosystem
[37:42] and a lot of people who just need way to break it,
[37:44] and we've kind of put in things like,
[37:45] we have something called Rapid,
[37:46] which is a really easy way to know who the decision-maker is.
[37:49] Just you line up who's your recommender,
[37:51] who has to agree who's a decision-maker.
[37:53] We have something called a five-day escalation rule,
[37:55] which makes sure that those items are in.
[37:57] And I think you lead a lot more of those views,
[37:59] I don't know what they're called,
[38:00] but they're just systems in place
[38:02] and where to manage that complexity so that things get done.
[38:05] And I think that those processes
[38:06] are actually really, really important
[38:07] to make sure that the ecosystem can run.
