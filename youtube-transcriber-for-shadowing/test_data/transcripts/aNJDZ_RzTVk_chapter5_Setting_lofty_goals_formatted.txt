For lofty goals, Brian was famous for going into meetings where people presented their goals and their plans. He would ask, "How do we 10x that? What do you need in order to 10x that goal?" Often, this approach would end up becoming the new goal. While it sometimes worked shockingly well, it also burnt a lot of people out. This raises an important question: how do you find the balance between being ambitious and setting goals that are not just impossible?

The first thing to consider is that we have market comparables, which is very exciting for us. When you look at companies like bill.com, Expensify, Concur, or Coupa, these are all large players in the market that can be very motivating. They also largely de-risk some of the business decisions we make. These existing markets provide a solid foundation for our goals. Additionally, we've been able to create markets ourselves. Spend management was an actual market before we and other competitors jumped into it, which makes it motivating to attack that market and drive revenue.

We also use designs as a way to motivate teams. We spend a lot of time with designers crafting out what the future of our product could look like, and that is extremely motivating. We constantly revisit these cornerstone loom walkthroughs of Figma prototypes that designers spend a lot of time discussing. I believe that this aspect is a significant part of our motivation.

Combining these elements helps us stay motivated. There is always a pushback to consider what we can realistically achieve, but having the market and revenue goals in mind allows us to move quickly. We are a revenue-driven company, and the designs keep us anchored on what our product could ultimately look like. Another important ingredient to how we operate is our commitment to empowering our product teams.
