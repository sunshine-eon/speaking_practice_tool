============================================================

[00:00] Is there anything else that is a good example of how you did something pretty different
[00:05] from how other companies operate?
[00:07] Anything else that comes to mind as a fun example?
[00:10] The goal-driven structures, I think, the things that we were talking about before, so the
[00:13] mission, actually breaking that down into the mission pillars, breaking those mission
[00:17] pillars down into the goals that we're then pursuing, and then celebrating those goals
[00:21] when we do achieve them, I think is a deeply underloved way of building a company.
[00:28] Some people have a mission that's kind of on the wall somewhere, and then what they're
[00:32] actually doing and the way they actually make money, and the way that the where people actually
[00:37] spend their time is in a very, very different direction from that original mission.
[00:42] I think the magic is when you can bring those two things together.
[00:45] You can have your mission, you can have your mission pillars that are actually helping
[00:49] to achieve that.
[00:50] I think there's a real authenticity in that for customers as well, is that you're actually
[00:54] doing the thing that you promised you do, and it all ladders up together.
[01:00] It's certainly not an easy way to run a company, but I think that when you do get that formula
[01:04] right, I think that there's a lot of authenticity with what you're saying.
