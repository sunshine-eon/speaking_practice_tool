============================================================

[00:00] Exactly. So I'm going to pull on a couple threads. The first is this idea of a single road map you
[00:04] talked about. And what this reminds me of is, I was talking to another very prominent CEO of a
[00:08] public company. And he pointed out that there's this cycle that he sees a lot of founders go through
[00:13] where they initially run the show, they're in charge, they tell people what to build.
[00:18] And then over time, they're encouraged to delegate and to empower. And it leads to a bunch of
[00:24] optimization work and small thinking maybe. And you talked about bureaucracy and politics.
[00:30] And then eventually you realize, I need to take the reins again and drive the ship and kind of
[00:34] take back control of what's happening. And it feels like you went on that journey.
[00:38] That's exactly how it went. And that's how it goes almost at every company I've heard of.
[00:43] By the way, I think that like many years ago, I remember I think reading a blog post by Ben
[00:47] Horowitz saying that a lot of people tell product led founders or engineering led founders to
[00:53] step away and delegate their product to other people. But suddenly they delegated away the
[00:58] thing they're best at the thing that is hardest for them to replace. So we don't have a chief
[01:03] product officer title. But if we had one, it would be me, you know, they wouldn't have a chief
[01:08] product. So I think the CEO should be basically the chief product officer of a product or tech
[01:14] company. And the CEO is not the chief product officer, then I don't know if they're a product
[01:19] or tech led company. Maybe maybe that's okay if they're an ops company, or if they're a marketing
[01:23] company, or if they're like not a tech company at all. But ultimately, I think the founder CEO
[01:28] should be that person. So when we were starting Airbnb, it was probably the three of us, you know,
[01:33] as you know, like I think Airbnb was a unique situation where it was three of us. I don't
[01:37] think any of us was that dominant. I probably played the closest thing to the role of the
[01:42] people listening like the closest thing to the role of the product manager. But again, I did
[01:46] marketing, I did design, I did like ops, I did like kind of a little bit of everything. So I was
[01:51] basically everything but engineering. And then as we grew, I started getting more and more hands
[01:56] off the product. And I always remember Lenny, when you write in this, there was this paradox
[02:01] where the less involved I was in a project, I mean, there was there, they'd be clear, there were times
[02:07] I inserted myself in dysfunction occurred, that is absolutely true. And that was just a learning
[02:11] experience for me. But there's this other scenario where the less involved as the project, the more
[02:17] spin there was, the less clear the goals, the less advocacy the team had, the less resources, the
[02:22] fewer resources they had. And then therefore the slower they moved, and the slower they moved,
[02:27] the more they assumed it was because I was too involved, right? Because people assume that our
[02:32] natural equilibrium is to move fast, to be slow, it's because of an over involvement and leadership.
[02:38] And therefore, I would get less involved, I would get teams more control, I would get them teams
[02:43] more empowerment. And the more I kept giving people what they asked for, initially, they may
[02:48] have been happy, but the outcome of it was always assumed weirdly, like they got less of what they
[02:52] wanted. They wanted to move faster, so I'd power them and they'd move slower. And again, how that
[02:57] happened is what I described, that you you you end up in a situation where you're delegated
