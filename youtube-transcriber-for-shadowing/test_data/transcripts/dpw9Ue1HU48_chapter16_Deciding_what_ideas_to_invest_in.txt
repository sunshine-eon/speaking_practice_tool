============================================================

[00:00] new thing that I want to say yes to. Yeah. So I love them the way your mind works. I'm excited to
[00:05] talk about culture and how this connects and the way you think about culture and through all these
[00:09] frameworks and lenses. Before we do that, you kind of hinted at this idea of how you pick what to
[00:15] work on. And I know you have kind of an interesting framework for how to decide what ideas are good
[00:19] and what ideas are worth investing in. I think both as a founder and a product leader,
[00:24] how do you think about deciding what is worth investing in? So imagine the Excel spreadsheet
[00:28] again. So let's say you're a valuing idea for a startup, for a new product, a new feature,
[00:32] whatever happens to be, I think this applies. So the first thing you should look at is,
[00:38] and I measure things on a scale of 0 to 10, because I like quantifiable things. I have to
[00:42] be able to multiply x by y. I don't like letter grades. Anyway, so put a number on it. It's
[00:49] like, okay, if this thing were successful, so let's say we're just picking a new startup idea,
[00:52] like I'm considering starting this new business. If it were successful, what could it be? What's
[00:58] the kind of magnitude of the outcome? However you decide, it could be impact, it could be revenue,
[01:01] it could be market cap, it could be personal, whatever it is. It doesn't matter. It matters,
[01:05] but not relevant for this discussion. So that's the potential. Thing number two is probability
[01:11] of success. Okay. And now I'm going to pause here and tell you the most common mistake people
[01:16] make is they think through the probability first without actually forcing themselves to
[01:24] think through the potential. And here's what happens. Is that they apply a filter that
[01:27] says, oh, I only have a like one in 10 chance to pull this off. There's only a 10% success rate
[01:32] or whatever. Not going to do that. Well, if it's a one in 10% one in 10 chance at $10 billion,
[01:40] it might be worth it, right? Like it might be that maybe not. Like sometimes it's, you know,
[01:44] based on stage of life and things like that, in terms of risk keeping afford. But like,
[01:47] for instance, and so by the way, and when I say probability, that's the sticky side of me,
[01:50] it's like, you can do it multiple ways, right? You can say, oh, here's the x% chance.
[01:54] You can do in statistics as an event tree that's like, oh, here's path a, there's a y% chance that
[01:59] happens. And here's what the outcome would be z% chance. Or anyway, you're the popular thing that
[02:04] you come up with what's called the expected value. Anyway, so let's say we just look at two branches
[02:08] like, oh, there's a 50 50 chance that I'm going to make $10 million. It's just we'll take a one
[02:15] branch just to keep this shorter. So the expected value of that is $5 million. Right.
[02:20] That's literally the expected value is like, oh, you got a 50 50 chance that a $10 million
[02:23] outcome. And let's say you have a 10% chance at a $100 million outcome, or a final variable,
[02:32] whatever it is. So mathematically, it's like, okay, well, you should at least consider that
[02:36] other one, even though the chances are lower, because the expected value is higher. Okay, so
[02:40] that's the number one. Anyway, we'll get through the rest. So start with the kind of potential
[02:44] outcome, then look at probably not the other way around, because then apply that mental filter
[02:48] and cast throw out ideas that may not have been worth throwing out.
[02:52] The third thing is what I think of is either passion or proximity. Do you care about this
[02:58] actual thing that you can actually kind of bring to bear? And then the fourth one is
[03:08] since I need a P word, it's like prowess. Like, do you have some assets, some something that
[03:13] makes you uniquely positioned either if you're building a new product, you have existing lines
[03:17] of code that you can reuse, you have a market that you already have access to,
[03:20] there's something about this particular idea that you have an unfair advantage pursuing,
[03:25] and that impacts your probability of success, right? And this is the other reason it's like,
[03:29] you need to kind of look at all those things. And once again, no one thing is the deciding
[03:33] factor. You're not going to just pick the thing that has the high expected values,
[03:36] take the potential times, whatever it's like, you have to sort of look at all of them and
[03:40] look at your own kind of situation. But it helps to kind of think through that to kind
[03:45] of have the kind of discipline to say, Oh, how big could it be? What are the chances?
[03:50] How much do I care about solving this problem? Is this something I can work on for two years,
[03:53] 10 years, 20 years? And finally, like, why me? Like, why me? Why my company? Why would we
[04:00] succeed at this? Why is our chance of success even low, higher than the rest of the rest of the
[04:06] world? Okay, so I'm already picturing the spreadsheet here. For every idea you have,
[04:09] you basically have a column, potential probability of success. Yes, proximity,
[04:15] you said, just like passion. Okay, passion. Yeah, I started with passion. And I have an
[04:22] issue with passion as a word, because it's ambiguous, because we talk within startup
[04:27] circles is like, Oh, pursue your passion. Sure. But it's like, you know what?
[04:36] Most of the companies that exist today that are even successful ones with awesome founders,
[04:41] they didn't necessarily pursue their passion. It's like they kind of, maybe you're
[04:45] in a particular problem or market segment or something like that. But it's like,
[04:50] it's okay to become passionate about something as you kind of dig into it or whatever. That's
[04:55] fine too. So anyway, so yeah, I have one of my favorite startups that I've invested in. It's
[04:59] called zip. It's a procurement platform. The founders were not passionate about procurement
[05:04] when they got into the space. They just saw a huge opportunity. They thought they could
[05:07] build a much better product. And they got passionate about it once they started working
[05:11] on it and finding this is the thing, right? So yes, if you can find your true calling,
[05:17] this is what you were meant to do in the world. And you have the opportunity to create.
[05:21] That's a tiny small fraction of people, right? Like that's that doesn't happen. And you may
[05:26] not even know what your passion like, especially if you're a first time founders, like, okay,
[05:29] well, I haven't seen the world that I don't know. It's like, so yeah, it's okay. So just
[05:35] for people if they're creating a spreadsheet for all their ideas and for startups,
[05:38] it's potential probability of success, passion prowess. Yes. Okay, amazing.
