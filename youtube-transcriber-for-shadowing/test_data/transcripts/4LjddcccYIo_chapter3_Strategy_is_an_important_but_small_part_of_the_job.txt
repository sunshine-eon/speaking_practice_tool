============================================================

[00:00] It's such an interesting list because when you ask most people what you need to get better
[00:05] at to become a great product manager, it's always communication skills, collaboration
[00:10] skills, vision, strategy, and it feels like these are input metrics to what it's normally
[00:16] what people think about.
[00:17] Those things to me, communication is super important.
[00:22] Analytical ability, really, really important.
[00:24] The ability to look at a, especially if you're doing something that has a user
[00:28] experience component, the ability to look at that and understand if it's going to work
[00:31] and build up intuition around that, also really important.
[00:34] Those are things that I would see as sort of basics of the role.
[00:37] These are the things that make you great, great at the role.
[00:40] And strategy to me, and hopefully we'll talk about strategy in a bit.
[00:45] It's one tiny slice.
[00:46] You do a strategy, but it's 5% of the work that you do.
[00:50] Yes, it's important because you want to get your strategy right and you need to
[00:53] pick the right products.
[00:55] At the end of the day, the person who has a good strategy will not be as successful as
[01:00] the PM who ships more stuff, gets more reps, and has the ability to actually create impact.
[01:07] So to me, you can be great at strategy, but if you're not good at this stuff and your stuff
[01:11] isn't getting out the door, you're never going to be that great at the job.
[01:14] Yeah, an impact is the other one.
[01:16] Everyone's like, what makes a great PM?
[01:18] Oh, drive a lot of impact.
[01:19] But they never say how.
[01:21] Right, exactly.
[01:21] It's like, cool, let's do a strategy.
[01:23] Let's have impact.
[01:25] And when I was starting off as a PM, I was hearing this advice and reading about it,
[01:29] and I was sitting there saying, awesome, I want to create impact.
[01:31] And I'm looking at my job thinking, now what?
[01:36] Like, yeah, impact.
[01:37] Let's do it.
[01:37] Where is it?
[01:38] How do I find it?
[01:39] Someone help me.
