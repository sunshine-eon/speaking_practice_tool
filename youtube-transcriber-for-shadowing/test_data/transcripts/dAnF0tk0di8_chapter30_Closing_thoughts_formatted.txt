Before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to share, touch on, or leave listeners with? 

I think one of the most important things to remember, and I touched on it in another answer, is that humans tend to complicate things. A lot of things are hard, but they're still simple until you make them complicated. Keep in mind that you can make a lot of progress with just two people. You can do great work in four-week increments, and you can figure things out as you go. You don’t need to know exactly where you’re going to be a profitable business. 

You can find customers who are willing to pay for your products or services. These are all possible things to achieve, and you don’t need to be a big, huge company to be successful. You don’t need to be a large corporation to make significant amounts of money. You don’t need to raise money to do this. In fact, all those things can complicate matters even more. 

Some people believe that having a lot of money makes things simpler, but it’s actually not simpler; it’s harder. The more resources you have, the more expectations come with them. Those expectations can erase your scrappiness. There are side effects to consider; those resources come with very thick and strong strings attached. 

You need to think about what those strings are attached to and what they prevent you from doing. Once you have those resources, you may not have the full range of motion anymore. So, I’ll leave people with that thought, even if I’ve touched on some of these issues earlier. That’s a great way to summarize.
