============================================================

Okay. I'm going to try to bring us back on course. The other thing you mentioned that I think is really interesting is hiring a president. A lot of founders and leaders might be hearing this and be like, going from eight reports and doing all these things I don't want to spending most of my time on the product and design and marketing. Amazing. What did this president take off your plate and what is their responsibility that allowed you to do the stuff you wanted to do?

The biggest thing was taking off the operations and the management of the executive team and the rest of the company. So think of the president role in Superhuman as an operationally extremely challenging and very growthful role. Like it is, it's perfect for someone who wants to go on to be a CEO in their next role. Instead of hiring and firing that team, instead of managing and setting their goals, instead of the accountability conversations, someone else is now doing that.

In addition, because that's not the only job, they're also a very strong thought partner when it comes to corporate strategy. This includes questions like where do we take Act One, our email product? How far do we go down the multiplier path? How aggressively should we lean into AI? What's a reasonable gross margin in a world with AI? Are we, from a financial perspective, okay dipping now and then coming back later? When should we start building our second product? How do we think about our R&D strategy? Should we keep on hiring in the Bay Area or, as we've done for many of our recent hires, continue hiring in Latin America? Should we consider other time zones as well? And so on and so on and so on. I mean, I'm just randomly coming up with questions, but the list is truly endless.

Another way to think about it is it's almost like a grown-up co-founder. The two people I co-founded the company with, Comrade and Vivek, they've long since gone from Superhuman. We're now a 10-year-old organization, and I'm one of those rare founders that is persisting and thriving actually 10 years in. That said, the journey never gets easier. It gets different, and you still need that co-founding energy around you. I have a handful of people in the organization who are in their roles providing that kind of energy, that kind of input, and who thrive off doing so. The president role is definitely one of them.

Incredibly interesting. There's so much there. One, just a couple of things I'll share, and then I want to move on to a different topic. One is just, it's cool that the solution to helping you move faster and do the work you want to do is org design. That feels like a really doable thing. If you're finding you're not spending time on things you want to spend time on and things aren't moving as fast as you want, you can essentially find people to take on things that you don't want and shift the way that the org is structured. That could solve a lot of problems. That's what it did for you.

And then I think it's also really interesting. There's this lesson here of as a founder, if you're just feeling like, I don't know, depleted or just not having the partner you want, you could bring someone on. That could be that person. Absolutely. Yeah. Okay. There's so much there. That was much more of a rich area than I even expected.
