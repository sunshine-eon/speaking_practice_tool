Time: 71:09 - 77:46
============================================================

[00:00] Amazing. Well, with that, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Archie, are you ready?
[00:06] I'm ready. First question. What are two or three books that you recommended most to other people?
[00:12] So one, I love to go back to like marketers who wrote in like the 1920s. And so one that I love
[00:20] is Scientific Advertising by Claude Hopkins. So it's basically one of the first kind of direct
[00:25] marketers that came out and kind of innovated on some of the concepts of copywriting and just how
[00:32] you like sell a product around. Can't make this product. Can't sell the product. Can you tell the
[00:37] product will help the customer achieve their goals? And so it's really fun. I find it really fun to go
[00:42] back in time. There's a lot of really good first principles thinking that I think we've
[00:47] actually lost in more modern stuff where it's like personalization, bandits, optimization,
[00:52] all this stuff versus like how do you actually write and sell things really effectively? Scientific
[00:57] Advertising is a great book. Just like the name alone, it sounds really cool, especially for someone
[01:03] in your shoes. That feels like the perfect book for your role. And I think there's so much wisdom
[01:08] and just like the thing someone figured out many years ago about what convinces people to buy
[01:12] something is still true and people over complicated and just going back to the original is often
[01:17] really useful. Totally. And the perfect mile about the chase for a sub four minute mile by
[01:26] Roger Bannister and a few other folks. Is it just a wonderful as a runner? It's a really fun
[01:32] book to read about kind of perseverance, how these folks really got all competed to get to that
[01:38] really amazing goal of a wonderful four minutes in a mile. Awesome. Do you have a
[01:44] favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed? You know, I went back in time and I watched
[01:51] for the first time, actually, the entire season or all the episodes of the Sopranos,
[01:56] which was quite quite fun. I highly recommend I did that in the wire in the last like six months.
[02:03] It's a lot of watching that. So it's a lot of watching, you know, work out in the morning
[02:07] on my elliptical or bike. So it's a nice. That's a smart work as show. That's a good
[02:13] motivator to just work out as I'm going to watch the next episode. The wire is like it's like hour
[02:18] long episodes and five seasons times 20 things, 22 episodes per season, right? Yeah. Oh, geez.
[02:24] It's a lot of a lot of watching. But and I did that once and I was like, I've got a lot.
[02:28] We got a lot of episodes to watch. But incredible. Okay. That's funny. I should say the
[02:34] Sopranos, I feel like a number of people recently told me they're watching the full
[02:37] Sopranos again. It's like a trend recently for some reason. Oh, interesting. Anyway,
[02:42] do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?
[02:45] So the AI music creator, my kids and I, I'm the least musical person in the world. It's been
[02:51] amazing. My kids and I will create songs together about our days, about what's going on. So it's
[02:57] just been been really fun to be able to have a musical experience for a non-musical person
[03:02] and have that creative experience for them. And it's been it's been really awesome.
[03:05] Tia. Suno is insane. I think at suno.ai folks want to check it out. It's just
[03:10] it's just like such a fun party trick to just to like write a song on the spot about something that
[03:14] you're thinking about. Awesome. Two more questions. The other favorite life motto that you often come
[03:19] back to find helpful in your current life? Yeah, I often come back to the plan as the plan
[03:25] until it's not. And it's basically like, we have a plan. If the plan is our best,
[03:30] let's commit to it. But acknowledged, it might change. It will do with it then.
[03:36] But it's kind of the combination of like, we have a plan. Stay focused on that
[03:40] with also the acknowledgement that you need to be flexible and try to combine those two
[03:44] sometimes contradictory things of focus plan with we got to be able to react in an effective way.
[03:52] Reminds me of strong opinions loosely held as a concept.
[03:58] Totally. Awesome. Okay. Final question. So I asked your wife what to ask you when you came
[04:03] on this podcast. And she suggested that I ask you about your late father who had a lot of impact
[04:09] on your leadership style. So here's my question, just what did you learn from your dad that
[04:15] impacts the way you work today? Yeah, he wanted my dad a lot is like a father and he was an
[04:21] entrepreneur and a technology. And I think one of the things that I so appreciate about
[04:26] his leadership style was the empathy and curiosity and kindness that that he he showed
[04:33] and everything. And I hope some of the stories that of, you know, him, it's like,
[04:40] no matter who anyone was like, curious, love to engage and learn from it. And I hope that's
[04:46] what I try to take inspiration from is like, just be with everyone kind and and learn from
[04:53] everyone you're you're with and around. So I think about a lot.
[04:58] That super resonates. He sounds like a wonderful human. As are you, Archie. This was wonderful.
[05:05] We touched on so much. We covered so much. I feel like we could go on for many more hours.
[05:09] Maybe we'll do around two as you learn more things at your time with Shopify.
[05:13] Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to potentially
[05:17] reach out or follow the stuff you're up to? And how can listeners be useful to you?
[05:21] Yeah, so not super on social media, but on LinkedIn. Check me out. Send me a message.
[05:29] And then, yeah, if folks are hiring a bunch of folks, growth marketers, PMs, engineers,
[05:35] data folks, UXers, you want to work at Shopify and growth or other parts,
[05:41] fully remote. So we'd love to have great people join.
[05:45] Awesome. And that last point I think I'll just highlight one of the few remaining fully
[05:49] remote tech companies that is not returning to work. Returning to the office.
[05:54] To office.
[05:55] And much work.
[05:57] Definitely work it.
[05:58] Yes.
[05:59] Yes.
[05:59] Amazing. And it sounds like basically you're hiring across all functions.
[06:03] All functions.
