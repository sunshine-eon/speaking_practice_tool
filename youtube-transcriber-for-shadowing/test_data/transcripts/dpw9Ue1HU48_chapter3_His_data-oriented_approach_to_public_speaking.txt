============================================================

[00:00] Okay, final fact. So Kip, is that how you pronounce the name Kip, your CMO?
[00:05] Okay, great. So I asked him what to ask you, and he tells me something that's really unique
[00:10] and interesting about you is you're obsessed with copywriting and comedy and keynote prep,
[00:15] that you have a very unique approach to preparing for a talk and how you think about
[00:18] humor and slide design and story art.
[00:21] That's very true. Public speaking is not something that comes naturally to me. So
[00:27] we're going to start there. We can talk a little bit about the copywriting of
[00:29] other things that are sort of related. And I tried to not do things that I'm not good at
[00:35] and don't enjoy. What are the rare exceptions that I snuck through is the need for me to
[00:41] get on stages as founder when we have our annual pop spot event, our conference, which
[00:47] at the time, when we did our first one, it was like 150 people at the Marriott, right?
[00:52] And then it's like steadily grown since then. And so now it'll be like 10,000 people
[00:56] in the live audience and hundreds of thousands online. But as I kind of came this realization
[01:04] that I was not going to be able to kind of talk my way out of it, and I kind of saw how
[01:09] where this was headed, I'm like, okay, this is something I'm going to have to actually
[01:13] like learn because I can't delegate it. Can't talk my way out of it. And so I'm a big
[01:18] believer in this talent versus skill, right? So we all understand talent. It's like
[01:24] someone has a talent for music, someone has a talent for athletics, whatever it happens
[01:27] to be. And that's true, but exists. But the way I think about it is talent basically controls
[01:33] the slope of the curve, but most things are actually acquirable skills. So for instance,
[01:37] if you have a talent for music, let's say, you might learn music faster than someone
[01:42] else, and your ceiling may be higher, but does not mean that other people can't learn
[01:46] music, right? It's like the acquirable skills. That's kind of lesson number one. And
[01:50] lesson number two is that there is a process, and this is the engineer in me, of just kind
[01:56] of functional decomposition of a problem to say, okay, in order for me to be a pretty
[02:02] good public speaker, like what are the underlying sub skills required in order to
[02:06] accomplish that? Okay, skill number one, you have to be able to stand up on stage
[02:09] and not pass out. Like, that's kind of the bare minimum, right? And so what I did
[02:14] over the years is to say, okay, I'm going to functionally decompose this skill of
[02:18] public speaking in front of what I call high-stakes speaking. I've got to actually
[02:23] hold the audience's attention. That's part of the success. It doesn't matter what the
[02:26] message is. Nothing else will matter if I lose their attention, which is
[02:30] increasingly easy to do now in a short attention span society. And every year,
[02:35] I will pick a different part of the public speaking skill set and say, oh,
[02:38] I want to learn about slide design and visual expression, not the actual
[02:42] designer. But then the one thing that I came up that has had the most
[02:46] impact is humor. But then you break that skill down just like the engineer would do.
[02:50] It's like, okay, well, there's humor writing. There's humor execution, like on
[02:54] stage, whatever. There's stand-up comedy. There's like, okay, so like how do you
[02:57] put all these pieces together? And along that journey, I came up with this,
[03:01] and I've always had this. I'm a very kind of data-driven,
[03:05] quant-based person. I was like, okay, well, how will I know whether
[03:10] something is like actually funny enough or not of whether I'm losing the
[03:14] attention or not? And so in preparation for one of these kind of high-stakes
[03:18] keynotes that I do every year, I will have my talk. I will do practice runs.
[03:26] I will have increasingly larger actual live audiences that I will practice it in
[03:31] front of. I will record those talks. Everything so far, nothing unusual yet.
[03:37] I will have the talks transcribed. I have custom software that I've written
[03:42] that will say, okay, here are the points at which the audience laughed.
[03:47] Like actually audibly laugh. That's the only way it counts.
[03:51] And this actually, and it comes down to this metric that stand-up comedians use,
[03:55] called LPM, laughs per minute. And there's actually a benchmark that you can say, oh,
[03:59] well, stand, you know, and stand-up comedians have a very, very high LPM.
[04:03] Business talks have a very, very low LPM. Like the most popular TED talks,
[04:07] there's a high strong correlation between the most popular TED talks and high LPMs.
[04:10] So I have a goal. I'm going to have a minute where I want to improve.
[04:13] And so I have software that will calculate for laughs per minute.
[04:17] And so then you learn these little kind of tools of the tricks of the trade.
[04:19] So it's like, okay, if you're solving literally for that ratio of laughs per minute,
[04:24] there are two ways to improve it. One is to add more laughs.
[04:30] Two is to decrease the number of words between laughs.
[04:33] Right? So it's like, so one of the things of software measures, it gives me a visual map.
[04:37] It's like, here's the entire talk broken down with a little square per minute of talk or 30 seconds.
[04:42] And it's like, here's what they laughed. It's like, oh, here I went one minute and 17 seconds
[04:45] and nobody laughed. So I have to do one of two things, shorten that segment if there's nothing
[04:50] funny that can be said without being overt about it. Or I have to say, okay,
[04:55] I'm going to find something funny to try to inject into this and kind of break it up.
[04:58] Anyway, that's a long way of saying, if I can get up on a public stage and learn that
[05:04] particular skill, anyone can learn just about anything. It just comes down to
[05:08] practice and measurement and just getting incrementally better over time.
