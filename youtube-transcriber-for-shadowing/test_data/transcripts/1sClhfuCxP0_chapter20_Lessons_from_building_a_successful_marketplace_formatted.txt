============================================================

You've helped build some of the most successful marketplaces in India and in the world. I'm curious just what may be a lesson or two about building a successful marketplace. One thing that I would definitely want to talk about is when you're thinking marketplaces, it's not as a one plus one equals two; it multiplies. When you're thinking about three-way marketplaces, you almost need to think like it's a two-dimensional thing going into three dimensions. It becomes that amount of complexity, and your regular product management and leadership principles will start failing. So, a bunch of usual suspects will not work. 

Let me give an example. OKRs will not work. Why not? Fundamentally, OKRs are a way to think about objectives and key results. But the fundamental assumption here is that it is solving for a kind of user, and that kind of user you can divide and conquer. Of course, there will be a little bit of hustle between different teams, but you can get them to work with each other. However, if it is working for three different kinds of users, then all the goals will always be in conflict with each other. 

What are examples of the three users? There's the delivery person, the restaurant, and the user. For instance, on the consumer side, we need to collect more delivery fees. What does that really mean for those other two? On the restaurant side, we need to get more commissions because profitability is the goal. And on the delivery partner side, it means paying them less or optimizing a little bit more. Once you start moving one lever, those two are already stretched toward the other direction. They are not independent levers in the first place. 

The way to model them out—how will it work out if we choose X versus what Y will change, and how Z will change—is almost impossible to do. I've seen OKRs fail multiple times when you're running this kind of marketplace. Big bets work much better. That's when you say, "Hey, we want to take this bet, but it's all going to come together. If we pull this lever, then something else will change." 

Here's the entire story: let's go make this profitable by making the delivery fee higher, but maybe not touching earnings per hour or restaurant commissions. I have found that's a better way to choose strategically which direction we have to go. 

The other thing is managing multiple empathies together. That's not straightforward. Swiggy, being a real-time hyperlocal marketplace, illustrates this well. As soon as the order comes, what happens between when the user does this and when the delivery executor is doing something else? They face absolutely different scenarios. At the same time, how will I really work with the user to manage their emotions? You need to manage a whole bunch of these things together. 

In product management here, you cannot have the delivery executive product manager only care about that side. They also need to be a champion on the consumer side and vice versa. I find with marketplaces that Uber went through this, Lyft went through this; the supply often just gets squeezed because they need to deliver for the customer. So, drivers end up getting hosed, and Airbnb hosts kind of get pushed to do things they may not want to do. Imagine delivery people facing the same thing. 

Now that you mentioned Uber, for example, one of the things that companies running taxi businesses face is if you have just one limited pool of money and you want to get the marketplace humming with respect to the number of orders per day, how do you decide whether to incentivize your users for the first ride, the first ten rides, and so on, or to put zero money in there but incentivize your drivers to come here? You have to think about liquidity in very different ways, and sometimes you need to pull the lever completely toward the other side. 

As for experiments, A/B experiments also don't work. And that's a very unique thing about marketplaces. When I say they don't work, I mean they don't work the way you would expect them to work because there are network effects all over. If you have to run A/B experiments on your driver side, if you put half the drivers on A versus half on B, there is a network effect between the both of them.
