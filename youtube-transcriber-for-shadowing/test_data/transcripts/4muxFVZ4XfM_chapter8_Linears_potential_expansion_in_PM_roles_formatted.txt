============================================================

Just one more question along these lines. There are other companies like Stripe, which waited until they had 200 employees to hire their first product manager. Snapchat is also famous for something similar. Do you have any sense of whether you think this might change? When do you think you might hire more product managers? Is it just a matter of seeing how it goes as you grow?

I think we will definitely hire more. As I mentioned before, we like to see our team members operating at a higher level. The whole company is built around the idea of having fewer people, but those who are of higher caliber and can think about larger scopes than just their current roles. 

We are trying to build smaller, more effective units. This is where the product managers come in; there will be fewer of them, and they won't be present at every level. However, as the company grows, and the team and product expand, we might have several product managers focusing on specific areas, types of products, or particular customer segments.
