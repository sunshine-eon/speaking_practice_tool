============================================================

[00:00] and on. While we're in the topic of just experiments and what you've done, I'm curious
[00:05] if there's just any examples of big wins that your team has shipped that might inspire people
[00:11] as they're thinking about launching experiments. I know there's probably some trade secret stuff
[00:15] you don't want competitors to know. And I know this is particular to Shopify and
[00:19] a platform in e-commerce, but I guess is there anything that would be worth sharing of like,
[00:22] oh, here's a huge win that maybe we didn't expect?
[00:25] Going back, there's always a lot of value in thinking through
[00:29] kind of monetary friction. As I mentioned, that's always going to be something to
[00:33] explore trial dynamics, different types of incentives. All of those things are very
[00:38] kind of impactful. I would say on things that are maybe more like practical and for everyone,
[00:45] there's an enormous amount. And we do see these with long-term effects,
[00:48] but just the nuts and bolts of sign-up, collecting the right information, and you usually
[00:56] want to collect more information than most people think you do in your sign-up flow.
[01:01] If you can leverage that to personalize the guidance, and this is the first to ask product,
[01:06] the guidance that someone can get when they onboard into Shopify. So whether you're
[01:10] coming on, Shopify is a very diverse product in person selling, online selling,
[01:15] different channels. There's the nuts and bolts of get more information from folks,
[01:20] build trust in there, give them the right amount of guidance when they come on in a
[01:24] personalized way. And that may sound like, okay, that's kind of obvious, but the amount of
[01:29] impact by just nailing those flows has never ceased to amaze me in setting up
[01:38] that person for long-term success. So kind of monetary friction, and then just really
[01:43] good onboarding, personalization, a well of opportunities there.
[01:49] I love that onboarding comes up every time I ask anyone where they've seen
[01:54] ongoing success and opportunities, particularly in actually surprisingly driving retention,
[01:59] like it's interesting that that's not what you look at, but turns out that's one of the
[02:02] biggest levers for increasing retention. Interesting that even for a company that
[02:06] doesn't look at retention, that's a big opportunity.
[02:07] Yes. Yeah, it's really because it's setting people up for, in the Shopify's case,
[02:11] I think the big thing about all of our metrics is what we get very nervous about is the easiest
[02:19] way to increase retention is always to constrict the funnel stage one above the retention metric
[02:25] you're trying to optimize for. The simplest way to increase my sign up to activate a thing is
[02:31] just make it harder to sign up, right? Like nuts and bolts, that will always happen
[02:37] is when you have teams on that local conversion rates, you kind of get all these weird team
[02:42] incentives, because they're optimizing to basically implicitly make it harder to do the step before
[02:48] them. And because we focus on that long-term GMV number of merchants who are successful,
[02:55] orienting every team to think about the total number of people, not the rate,
[03:01] but the total number of people who got to the end of their kind of part of the journey
[03:07] is a very powerful way to incentivize people to do the right thing in terms of getting people set up
[03:14] versus do the... I'm going to constrict the funnel step right before me to make my local
[03:20] conversion rate look better, which is the bane of my existence, but something I see a lot of
[03:25] teams implicitly or explicitly do when they get too focused on rates as a way to think about the
[03:32] world. Incentives, what a power, what a lover. I definitely want to chat a little bit more about
[03:37] metrics. Now, you have a really interesting take that's kind of built on what you're just
[03:40] talking about, but first of all...
