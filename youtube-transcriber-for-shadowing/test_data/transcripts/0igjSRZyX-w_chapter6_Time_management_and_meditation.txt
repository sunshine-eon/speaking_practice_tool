Chapter 6: Time management and meditation
Video: Superhuman's secret to success | Rahul Vohra (CEO and founder)
Time: 18:06 - 27:35
============================================================

[00:00] Or who does what?
[00:01] When we hired our initial executive teams,
[00:03] I followed very conventional wisdom.
[00:06] I ended up with a set of VPs
[00:09] and eight, I think, direct reports, maybe even nine.
[00:12] And I thought that's what you were meant to do.
[00:14] That's how startups are meant to scale.
[00:17] But as anyone who's been there knows,
[00:19] eight direct reports is a lot.
[00:21] It's a lot of hiring, it's a lot of goal setting,
[00:23] it's a lot of OKRs, it's a lot of accountability conversations
[00:26] and fortunately also it's a lot of firing.
[00:29] No CEO ever gets their executive team right on the first try.
[00:33] So that time I had for the things that I think
[00:36] I can genuinely be world-class at,
[00:38] things like product and design and technology and marketing,
[00:42] that all began to rapidly disappear.
[00:44] And as a result, the organization began to slow down.
[00:48] Fortunately, I was also tracking my time very closely,
[00:52] I had this crazy way of tracking it.
[00:54] And at one point I noticed I was spending six to seven percent
[00:58] of my week on these areas,
[01:00] these areas where I can truly be world-class at.
[01:03] So I had two realizations.
[01:04] Number one, as CEO, once you get to a certain scale
[01:08] and we were definitely at that scale,
[01:10] you can actually define what you want the role of the CEO
[01:13] to be at your company.
[01:15] And number two, the superhuman opportunity
[01:17] deserves everyone who works at the company
[01:20] to spend as much time as possible in their zone of genius.
[01:24] And so that includes me as well as everybody else.
[01:27] So what I did is I hired a really great president,
[01:30] I went from eight direct reports to two,
[01:32] and the amount of time that I spend
[01:34] on product design, technology and marketing went up
[01:38] from six to seven percent to about 60 to 70 percent
[01:42] of my week.
[01:43] Just to mirror back a few things,
[01:44] one is people may feel like you are not shipping
[01:48] as much as you used to because you're actually
[01:50] building things they don't care about,
[01:52] which is support for office and all these things
[01:54] that they don't need,
[01:55] but the business needs to expand integrations
[01:58] with Microsoft and Android and all these things.
[02:01] I think that's such a good point that like it looks
[02:03] like nothing's happening when there's a lot of good stuff
[02:06] happening for other users that aren't you.
[02:08] And then there's this point about people delegate
[02:12] and then they were like a leader delegates
[02:13] hires all these execs and then like,
[02:15] this is not what I wanted, why do I done this?
[02:17] And you think it's gonna speed up, but it slows down.
[02:21] A couple of threads here that are really interesting.
[02:23] One is this time tracking thing.
[02:25] I need to know how do you do this?
[02:27] This is the fact that you knew like seven to eight percent
[02:30] or whatever the number you said,
[02:31] like to that granularity,
[02:32] have your time you're spending on things you wanted
[02:35] was that low, how do you do time tracking?
[02:38] Let's not go super far, but just what's your approach?
[02:41] So this is a technique that I call the switch log.
[02:45] And it's born out to the observation
[02:48] that your calendar says what you thought
[02:50] you were going to do,
[02:52] but it's really only your trail of work
[02:56] that describes what you actually did.
[02:58] So how can we capture that?
[03:00] And actually how can create a system of work
[03:03] that isn't tethered to a calendar
[03:06] where you aren't at the behest of what some timetable says
[03:10] you do or you don't have to do?
[03:13] So I came up with the following idea.
[03:15] What if I just did whatever the heck I wanted?
[03:19] What if every single time I change task,
[03:24] I just slack DMed my EA,
[03:27] but this also works in Slackbot,
[03:29] like you can just, just has to go somewhere.
[03:31] I slack DM my EA and I said TS colon,
[03:36] and then a few words for the task I was doing.
[03:39] Well, that would create certain changes.
[03:42] Instead of having to constantly look at the calendar
[03:44] and think, oh, should I stop this task, start that task?
[03:48] I can just do what I want.
[03:49] Like if what I feel right now is,
[03:51] oh boy, I really need to prepare for Lenny's podcast,
[03:54] I'll go ahead and do that.
[03:55] And if I get bored or distracted eight minutes in,
[03:58] which sometimes happens
[04:00] because something else just bubbles up
[04:02] to the top of my mind,
[04:03] well, there's a reason that my body is bubbling it
[04:05] up to the top of my mind.
[04:06] I also practice transcendental meditation.
[04:08] So I'm very keen on the idea of being aware
[04:12] and listening to what's bubbling up.
[04:14] And so it's okay for me to then go and attend
[04:17] that thought as opposed to start to expend my focus points
[04:21] to my discipline or willpower
[04:23] on the thing that I thought I was meant to be doing.
[04:26] All I'd have to do is I'd go back to slack TS colon,
[04:30] dealing with this other thing.
[04:31] And by the way, you should obviously turn up
[04:33] for your meetings.
[04:34] I'm not saying just like a blow through your meetings
[04:36] and not turn up for your one-on-ones,
[04:38] definitely do those things.
[04:39] What I'm saying is do what feels right
[04:43] for as long as it feels right to do.
[04:46] Then at the end of the week,
[04:47] you can see where your time is going.
[04:49] And I realized at one point that I was spending only
[04:53] in those days like 5% of my time on recruiting,
[04:56] whereas perhaps I should be spending 20 or 30%
[04:59] or more of my time on recruiting.
[05:01] But the biggest thing was I saw I was only spending
[05:03] 6 to 7% of my time on product, on design,
[05:07] on technology and marketing.
[05:08] And these are things where I know I'm really good at them.
[05:10] I should either be teaching people how to do them
[05:12] or doing them or some combination of both.
[05:15] That's probably the best thing for me.
[05:16] It keeps me really happy, very joyful,
[05:19] keeps me sharp, but it's also scaling the organization.
[05:22] And so that's how we had that kind of an insight.
[05:24] Once you have this Slack log,
[05:27] you can then graph it and chart it
[05:29] and see where your time is actually going.
[05:31] How cool.
[05:32] Clearly this is an app opportunity
[05:34] or like an agent opportunity
[05:35] where you're just telling this thing every time.
[05:38] It's essentially tracking context switches,
[05:40] which we're always hearing,
[05:42] try to not to avoid context switches.
[05:44] Yeah, I think context switches are fine.
[05:46] I mean, there's definitely this idea
[05:47] that for every interruption you have,
[05:51] the brain does take roughly 21 minutes on average
[05:54] to recover, to get back to the efficacy
[05:57] before that you were disturbed.
[05:58] And it's a big deal, of course,
[06:00] I'm building productivity software.
[06:01] We design superhuman to minimize the amount of distraction
[06:04] and disruption that's possible within the app.
[06:07] But if you're working on something
[06:08] and at the back of your mind, something bubbles up,
[06:12] you have to attend to it in one way or the other.
[06:15] Sometimes I just fright it down
[06:17] and I have a, actually I don't have my notebook with me,
[06:19] but it's really big.
[06:20] I have like a gigantic, whatever, twice the size of A4
[06:23] is I guess A3 sketchbook.
[06:26] And I always have a 4H pencil.
[06:28] So whenever one of those thoughts comes up,
[06:30] I just scribble it down
[06:32] or I actually stop what I'm doing
[06:34] and I attend to that task.
[06:36] Because there's a reason it's bubbling up right now.
[06:38] I love that you know,
[06:39] is it actually the type of paper and pencil, 4H pencil?
[06:43] A3 paper.
[06:44] Very simple.
[06:45] Okay, this is gonna be a theme.
[06:47] You mentioned meditation, you said you do TM.
[06:49] So you do 20 minutes in the morning, 20 minutes.
[06:51] Is that you do it that style or you do a longer session?
[06:55] I do about half an hour in the morning,
[06:56] including rest time.
[06:58] The physical rest components of it is very important to me.
[07:00] It's 20 minutes of the actual meditation
[07:02] then 10 minutes of rest.
[07:04] And I do that in the morning
[07:05] as well as in the afternoon at around 3PM.
[07:07] And you just carve that out in calendar, you know,
[07:08] everyone knows Rahul at three o'clock,
[07:10] he's gonna be out.
[07:11] Absolutely.
[07:13] My EA knows,
[07:15] they're the one who's organizing the calendar
[07:16] and making sure things happen when they need to happen.
[07:18] They also know that nothing can override this TM block.
[07:23] Without it, I genuinely start to fall apart.
[07:26] But with it, I'm able to access
[07:29] some very deep competencies that I didn't have before.
[07:33] I've been doing this now for about four or five years.
[07:35] And initially, I simply felt happier,
[07:39] occasionally even more euphoric,
[07:41] coming out of a really great meditation session.
[07:43] But over time, I found that my ability to focus
[07:48] was increasing, I could hold attention on something
[07:50] for much longer, but I also was able to become
[07:53] much more creative and much more expressive.
[07:56] These are well-known side effects, as it were,
[07:59] or intended effects for some people of TM.
[08:02] And interestingly about TM,
[08:04] if you compare it to other forms of meditation,
[08:06] they don't have quite the same impact
[08:08] across quite as many executive functions.
[08:11] So there's something particularly interesting
[08:13] that's going on with transcendental meditation
[08:14] as opposed to other forms that folks
[08:17] are still trying to unravel and figure out.
[08:20] Folks, if they're inspired and they want to check out
[08:23] this form of meditation and any advice
[08:24] on where they could go learn.
[08:26] Absolutely, a lot.
[08:28] But in summary, have a coach teach you.
[08:31] I had many false starts myself with meditation,
[08:33] trying the various apps, learning from books.
[08:36] None of it really worked for me.
[08:38] What worked was having one-on-one teaching
[08:42] from someone themselves who had been taught one-on-one,
[08:46] the yogic or the Raj tradition of teaching.
[08:50] And this person in particular had also been
[08:54] a venture-backed founder multiple times over.
[08:57] And so they're very well aware of the kinds of stresses
[08:59] that I tend to be under,
[09:01] and all of his clients are mostly in technology as well.
[09:04] If you're in the Bay Area,
[09:06] this person's name is Laurent Valasek,
[09:09] and they run an institution called
[09:11] the Peak Leadership Institute.
[09:13] And this is all about how we can live
[09:15] a more integrated and whole life,
[09:17] integrating wellness practices like meditation,
[09:20] but for the purpose of unlocking peak performance
[09:23] in life and in business.
[09:25] Thank you for sharing that.
[09:25] That is very actionable.
[09:27] We're gonna link to that in the show notes.
