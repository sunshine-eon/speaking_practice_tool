============================================================

Okay, so let's talk about hiring. As with most areas, you're very, very, very deliberate about hiring. The bar is so insanely high at Linear, and you also hire very few people. So, just a few questions along these lines. One is, when you're hiring people, what do you look for that you think maybe other people are not looking for enough? And where do you spend a lot of time?

I think one of the things we, all of us founders, kind of saw in these high-growth companies is that sometimes the high growth, especially on the employee side, is not that great. It can create a lot of chaos or messiness. In my past working in companies, it was almost never the case that it was easier to work with a larger team of average people than with a smaller team of very high-quality individuals. It's always faster and yields better output when you have a much smaller team. So, that was kind of the belief we have at Linear: you can actually build better with fewer people than with more.

When it comes to hiring, we've been taking very slow steps. In the first year, we didn't hire anyone. In the second year, we hired a couple of people, and then in the following year, we hired a few more. We never topped more than doubling in a year, and that's kind of our guideline: we shouldn't more than double. This might be something we change in the future, but what we look for in hiring includes a couple of things. It obviously depends on the role, but generally, we often talk about the need for some taste or understanding of how things are done, or a broader perspective beyond just their specific role.

For example, when we talk about engineering hires, they need to have some skill set or product thinking. They should be able to articulate why some choices are better than others or have a history of disagreeing with some of the company's or team's choices. We want them to be good developers, but we also look for product sensibility and judgment.

This approach is similar for marketing hires. We need the marketing skill sets, but we also want to see that the person is a good storyteller or has an appreciation for writing and stories. They should have a taste for what is interesting and what is not. Similarly, when hiring an operations person, we like to see that they have an understanding of HR, even if it's not their primary role. 

When you have people who are a little more than their title, the company becomes much easier to manage. People can pick up things more easily and work together more effectively because everyone shares more areas of understanding. It’s rare to hear someone say, "It's not my job." Instead, they understand that, while they may be in operations, they might need to help with an HR issue, and that’s okay.

Essentially, we're looking for these Venn diagram overlaps across different functions and teammates. Additionally, we want to build a company with fewer employees, which means we don’t want many specialized roles or overly specific areas of ownership. We believe we can build this with fewer people who can take on more scope and own more responsibilities.

Traditionally, in companies, to gain more scope, you need to advance through the levels, as there are many different teams and levels. To gain any kind of scope, you have to rise to higher levels. What we try to do is eliminate the need for so many levels. People can start owning more areas right from the beginning. This can be much more interesting—not to everyone, but to many people. It’s how I’ve always felt as a designer; my job wasn’t just about looking at designs. I felt I needed to help the business or other areas as well, and that perspective comes naturally to me.
