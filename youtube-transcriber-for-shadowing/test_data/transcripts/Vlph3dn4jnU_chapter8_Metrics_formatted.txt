============================================================

Let's follow this thread of metrics. You're big on absolute numbers, and you've been talking about this already versus percentages and ratios. Talk about that and how you encourage your teams to think about metrics. 

I think one of the things that happens, particularly in a large organization like Shopify, which has about 600 folks, is that teams naturally break up the world into different funnel stages or different points in the journey. It gets very seductive to just look at my part of the funnel and focus on my conversion rate through that part. The team starts to optimize for that conversion rate as their North Star over a longer time period, aiming to move their conversion rate from 10% to 12%, for example. 

However, in practice, it’s almost always easier to make it harder to do the thing right before your step in the funnel to increase your conversion rate. If I make it harder to sign up, it’s going to be very easy to increase the sign-up to activation rate because I just have fewer people, and the people who made it through are of higher intent. I see teams get really stuck when they try to optimize conversion rates but end up making it harder to do the previous step. 

Instead, everyone should be thinking about the absolute number of people who made it through their stage of the funnel. Rather than focusing on converting a bunch of people at a specific rate, the goal should be to get more people activated. Once you start thinking that way, you realize that the best way to get more people to a step is often just to get more people in the door in the first place. 

This means making it easier to sign up or reducing friction. It’s the opposite of what many teams are inclined to do, and while this approach may hurt your conversion rate, it can actually lead to more people entering the funnel. Many teams become nervous when they see their retention rate or LTV go down, fearing it will affect their ability to pay. However, your CAC likely went down by even more, giving you the ability to spend more while having more people move through the activation or immersion journeys. 

What I'm hearing is that teams should focus not on increasing the conversion step by some percentage but rather on driving an incremental absolute number of new potential merchants. Exactly.
