============================================================

[00:00] Let me touch on a couple more things before I let you go.
[00:04] One is marketing.
[00:05] So we talked about sales, marketing.
[00:07] You guys don't have a CMO.
[00:09] There's no Shopify CMO.
[00:11] Instead, you embed marketing leads within the org for folks that are trying to grapple
[00:16] with that.
[00:17] Should we hire a CMO?
[00:18] Should we do something else?
[00:19] What have you learned about maybe the benefits and also maybe some downsides of approaching
[00:22] it the way you guys have approached it?
[00:25] The benefit is that there's growth marketing who sits in growth.
[00:29] There's revenue marketing who sits over closer to sales.
[00:31] There's a brand team under Harley who does amazing work, our president.
[00:37] There's marketing embedded in core and PMMs sit with product managers there.
[00:41] There's shop marketing on a consumer side.
[00:43] Marketing is truly everywhere in the org.
[00:46] And I think the benefit of it is it's closest to the primary kind of goal that those marketers
[00:55] are trying to do.
[00:56] They sit with growth so we can focus on that self-service motion.
[01:01] Harley is an amazing communicator, so brand sits with him so he can have a lot of influence
[01:06] over that.
[01:07] And so I think it sits with the people what's most relevant outcomes are driving, which
[01:12] is great because it allows us to move faster with less coordination.
[01:16] I think it only works because Toby Harley has such amazing intuition on what the
[01:22] brand is, needs to be, and all of that, that some of what the CMO does of kind of creating
[01:30] the cohesive story of Shopify is kind of held in their heads and they have the pen on that.
[01:38] And so that allows then that piece, that CMO's job to not be as important at Shopify,
[01:43] but the other pieces are obviously critical, but they can be now closer to the action
[01:49] in where they're kind of going to drive the most most impact.
[01:53] The downside is things are sometimes very messy, right?
[01:55] So that's the yeah, it's another example where the founder can their background and
[02:01] interest and skills can impact significantly the way the work is structured and who
[02:05] you hire and don't hire.
