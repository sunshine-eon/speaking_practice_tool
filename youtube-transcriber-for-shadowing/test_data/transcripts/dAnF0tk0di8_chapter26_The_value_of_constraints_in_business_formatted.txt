What I'm hearing is essentially to do this well, you need discipline. You have to understand the incentives that are driving you to spend more money and grow faster. It's important to be really good at managing those incentives. It also sounds like you need investors who are on board with this approach. They need to understand that we’re not going to focus on growth obsession or great routines; instead, we’re going to give you the space to build it the way you want. That kind of support exists, but it’s also an outlier in the industry.

I think what you need are constraints. When you have loads of money, you essentially have very few constraints, which can lead to sloppiness. On the other hand, when you face the reality of needing to make payroll next week or next month, you start to figure things out. One of the best stories I heard about this was from Peter Rahall, who started RX Bar. Are you familiar with RX Bar? They’re those little protein bars. There’s a great article from years ago where he talked to his dad about raising money. His dad told him, “Hey, go sell a thousand fucking bars and come back and talk to me.” 

His advice was straightforward: just sell some bars. Get out on the street and sell, rather than getting bogged down in all the things you could do if you had more resources. That kind of scrappiness is invaluable, and you don’t get that from having large sums of money. It’s too easy not to have to do anything when you’re flush with cash. Not to say that VC companies aren’t doing things—they are, obviously—but are they honing those scrappy skills? Are they learning how to make money, have margin, and be profitable? If they don’t have to, they probably aren’t.

I think we’re starting to see a shift now. This isn’t an “I told you so” moment; it’s just what happens during economic cycles. Money is harder to find and harder to get. Even companies that have raised money are finding that investors are less interested in putting in additional rounds. We’re seeing deep cuts, layoffs, and a lot of pain and suffering. It’s difficult to switch from having a lot to not having enough and then having to work as if you know what to do.

There’s a lot of confusion in the market now, especially at companies, because they don’t know what to do. They haven’t had to navigate this before. I feel for them because, frankly, how could they be expected to know what to do? Just like I mentioned earlier, if someone dropped 10 million bucks on me and a thousand people, I would have no idea what to do with that. Truly, I would waste it. If you don’t have the experience, how are you going to know?
