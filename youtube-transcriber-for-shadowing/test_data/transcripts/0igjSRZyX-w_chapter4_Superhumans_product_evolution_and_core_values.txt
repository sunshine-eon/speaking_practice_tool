[00:00] people. And that's where there really isn't any substitute to having a genuinely multiplayer or
[00:05] a genuinely collaborative product. That's one of the huge evolutions we've taken Superhuman through
[00:10] over the last probably about two years. Early last year, we launched what we call Superhuman 2.0.
[00:17] And the basic idea is we saw almost every single other app of note become collaborative by default.
[00:24] Figma, Notion, Loom. These are all multiplayer or collaborative by default. Yet email, the one
[00:30] tool that we all use more than anything else, even more than things like Slack,
[00:36] was still firmly stuck in its single player origins.
[00:40] I want to come back to something that you mentioned that I kind of didn't come back to you. I think
[00:45] is really core to what you just shared, which is word of mouth being so important. Like,
[00:50] people talk about all these viral features and sharing, contact books and all these things in
[00:54] your point is that takes you to a place. But really what helps a consumerish product spread is
[01:01] word of mouth people sharing with each other, which then the question is, how do you do that?
[01:04] We're going to talk about a lot of things that you did to make Superhuman something people want
[01:08] to share. But in the end, it's just like making something people want to share. That's like the
[01:12] definition almost. So then it's like, what makes people want to share stuff? It's amazing. It's
[01:17] helping them something that is remarkable. Well, it turns out you mentioned remarkableness. That
[01:23] is one of our core company values. And if you think about what a company has to do, it has to
[01:28] grow. How do things grow? Well, let's take Ellie, it's advice at face value. And I believe it's true.
[01:34] It's creating something that people share. You mentioned one way of doing it, which is something
[01:40] that people want to share. There's actually another way, which is simply creating something
[01:46] remarkable. You use that word. And that is one of the core values of Superhuman. So we have create
[01:52] delight, create something that is so joyful, that really truly brings people delight. We have
[01:58] deliver remarkable quality, something that is so striking, so compelling and worthy of attention
[02:04] that people can't but help tell others about it. And then we have build the extraordinary, which is
[02:09] a measure of the sort of efficacy or the innovativeness of what we want to build. So that's
[02:14] another trick, which is literally baking these raw ingredients for growth into your company values.
[02:20] I didn't know that was one of your values. That makes so much sense. Okay, we're going to come
[02:25] back to that because I think that is there's so much to learn about how you think about product and
