This kind of advice comes up a lot actually on this podcast, especially for product managers. There's a lot of power in just trusting your instincts and not just being this kind of unbiased participant in a product team. Having actual insights based on your own experience using the product and your life experience is invaluable. This topic came up a lot in Brian Jeske's episode. Many people noted that he runs the company and tells everyone where they are building. A lot of people said, "Okay, that'd be great if our CEO was also a designer, a very product-minded person." However, many people aren't like that; not everyone has enough experience to build amazing instincts. 

So, how do you solve that? Do you hire people with a lot of experience? Is it about trusting those who have more experience? Because not everyone is going to have the right instinct. It's true that Brian is probably one of the greatest CEOs around today, but I personally prefer small businesses. He knows how to run a bigger organization, but I wouldn't. I can't really step into that answer from that perspective. One of the reasons we stay small is so we can all rub off on each other. When we hire, we can be very selective because we only bring on a few people each year.

When I hire designers and product people, I’m curious about their taste. I want to know what they like, what other products they admire, and what influences they bring to the table. This helps me understand who they are and how they see the world. During the interview process for designers specifically, we have them do a project for us at the end. The last five finalists will complete a project, and we pay them for it. They have a week to do it, and then I critique it with them. Even if I love it, I will push back in certain areas.

One of the things I often ask is, "If you had another couple of days, what would you do with this?" I want to see where people go with that. To me, that’s where you can see their instincts. They don’t have time to think, so where does their gut go? What do they arrive at after having to riff on the spot? What’s behind what they built? It should just be a portion of what they had in mind; it shouldn't be everything. I’ve seen some people who we thought were really good, but in that moment, they didn’t know where to go with it. 

That’s not to say some people don’t need time to think it through, but I’m looking for those whose gut is filled with ideas. It doesn’t always translate, but that’s how I try to assess whether someone has a good gut instinct. It almost doesn’t matter where they go with it because this is raw, just raw gut. I want to see that they have one and are willing to lean into it, not afraid of saying things that may not make sense. I want them to play with ideas and explore possibilities.

When we start riffing, there’s a synchronicity I’m looking for. When I feel that synchronicity and resonance, like two wavelengths perfectly vibrating together, then I know we have something. That’s the kind of stuff I’m looking for when I hire people. I believe this translates to individuals with a better gut feel than someone who is more of an academic product person. While that approach can work in other places, it wouldn’t really fit here.

That’s really great advice for someone looking for someone with good instincts. It’s interesting because what you described is often the opposite of what many people want. Many leaders think, "We have plenty of ideas; we just need you to help us ship stuff." However, I don’t want just ideas either. 

They have to create something that is clear and good. They also need to be able to riff on the spot and think about how else they could take the project. We’ve had people who were scatterbrained, with a million ideas, but when asked to execute something for a project, it was a total mess. You could see their time management skills were off, and they focused on the wrong things. That’s a no-go for me. 

What’s a go is a clever design that is well executed, thoughtful, and clear. I want to know where they could take it from there if they had a few more days. Even if we had just 15 minutes, I want to see what they would do with that. That’s the meat of it. I always think of it in terms of play. I want to play with this product, this design, this idea. It’s about play, which is a very clear thing, versus a rigid, boring approach to product development. That can be successful, but it wouldn’t work at our company.

Great clarification. I completely agree.
