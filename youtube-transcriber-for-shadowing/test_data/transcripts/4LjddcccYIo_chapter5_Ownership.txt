[00:00] The other thing is I think that there's just like a focus you need to get better good at
[00:05] just like people often want to lump together a bunch of ideas and then every time you do
[00:09] that it just dilutes everything.
[00:10] So I think there's just a lot of power in like pick the thing pick the thing that's
[00:13] going to have the most impact and cut other stuff that may have something back but is
[00:16] much less important.
[00:18] I think again simplification is something and prioritization which is sort of the same
[00:22] thing gets tossed around a lot as a thing you have to get good at but it's really
[00:27] challenging.
[00:28] The one thing you should do is extremely difficult and being able and having the
[00:34] gumption to say no to all those other things is really hard because there's
[00:38] probably at any given time 10 things you should do but you can't do 10 things
[00:43] you'll never be successful if you do that my number of things and so you have
[00:45] to pick one.
[00:46] And so it's both figuring out how to get confident in your decision and then be
[00:51] having the willingness and it maybe I should have added this to my what
[00:57] makes great PM's list the willingness to make the bet and be responsible for it.
[01:01] And that's why I think separates the PM role from a lot of other roles and why
[01:05] it's such a challenging job when done right is because you have to be
[01:09] willing to take responsibility and it's your job to pick the thing and it's
[01:13] your job to be accountable to your team for picking the thing.
[01:16] So you better get it right.
[01:19] Ownership such an important part of just being a PM again coming back
[01:24] to this interview I just did with an ex-Amazon guy that's one of their
[01:27] principles in Amazon is just leaders basically ownership feeling like you
[01:30] have ownership of what you're working on.
[01:33] I agree but to me at least the word ownership doesn't have the same like
[01:37] oh shit feeling as you you're making a bet like you make a bet that means you
[01:41] know that there's a chance that the thing you're working on is not going
[01:44] to work out and you still have to be the one to like do the thing jump
[01:48] off the ledge like drop in on the ski run so ownership to me never
[01:52] signaled that like risk that I think comes with being a PM.
[01:57] Good point on the simplify concept it reminds me at Airbnb one of the core values
[02:01] at Airbnb for time was simplify is this idea that we should always try to be
[02:07] simplifying and then it turned out the founders realized we're not actually
[02:11] great at this and it's unfair for us to say this is a value for not doing it
[02:15] so they actually cut it as a core value because their feeling was we shouldn't
[02:19] have aspirational values we should reflect who we actually are and they actually
[02:23] cut two different values to be more clear even though they still want to
[02:28] simplify they're just like we're not we're not actually good at this so why
[02:31] are we pretending like we are.
[02:32] I think maybe I'm good at it on paper but there's been many times
[02:35] where I've been in situations where things are not simple and you just have to keep
