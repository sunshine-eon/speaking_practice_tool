============================================================

[28:37] and hitting the application button.
[28:38] Let's talk about LinkedIn as a company to work in,
[28:41] culture maybe for a bit.
[28:43] You told me that you have a story
[28:44] about your first product review when you joined LinkedIn
[28:47] and how that was wild.
[28:49] Can you just tell that story?
[28:50] I haven't heard this yet.
[28:51] Yeah, so I came through a small acquisition
[28:54] that they made of our company.
[28:55] And I thought it was such a telling moment
[28:57] in this first product review.
[29:00] I went in and as you can imagine,
[29:01] when you join a company, there's a lot of advice
[29:03] on kind of how you should make that product work.
[29:06] I don't know anything, I've never been a PM.
[29:08] And I remember kind of taking a lot of that advice
[29:11] and putting together a presentation
[29:12] and just getting destroyed during that review.
[29:15] I think Jeff was the head of product NCEA at that point.
[29:18] And in a very kind way, it was basically like,
[29:20] wait, this doesn't make any sense.
[29:22] And I just remember driving home
[29:24] and kind of calling my wife and I like,
[29:25] I think I might be fired.
[29:26] I'm not sure if I was fired.
[29:28] But he was very kind about it.
[29:29] He's like, just come back and exit,
[29:30] I think it's like five or four weeks.
[29:31] And I remember at that point, I was like,
[29:33] if you're gonna go in and yell at one more shot,
[29:36] just do something you believe in, right?
[29:37] And kind of make sure it kind of works.
[29:39] And we started from that point
[29:40] and we worked backwards from there and this concept of,
[29:42] hey, I do believe that the most important thing
[29:45] is connecting opportunity and we should really understand
[29:47] how to do that and let's just start from there.
[29:48] And it went very well.
[29:50] And to me, it was another way of you,
[29:51] you're in these large systems,
[29:53] you're in these large companies, you're in these large,
[29:55] I think LinkedIn is very special because,
[29:59] no matter what it is, it's got a very good North Star.
[30:02] And it was a moment for me to kind of really hammer that home
[30:05] that like as long as you get that North Star
[30:07] in ahead of you, you're gonna be just fine.
[30:10] And I think it's, I never worked at a place like that before.
[30:14] And I think a lot of times people wonder,
[30:16] I mean, imagine the way we're talking about,
[30:18] we certainly have an engagement ecosystem,
[30:20] we have the hiring business
[30:21] and we have a marketing solutions business,
[30:22] we have a big premium business.
[30:24] You can imagine when you're trying to make decisions
[30:26] across that, it could get very, very complicated.
[30:29] And I think when people ask me to describe LinkedIn,
[30:31] I often start with that story because I feel like it,
[30:34] it helps cut through how decisions are made
[30:36] and kind of what is seen as success here.
