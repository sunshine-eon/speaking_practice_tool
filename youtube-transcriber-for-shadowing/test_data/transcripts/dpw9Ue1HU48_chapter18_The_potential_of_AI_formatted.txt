============================================================

Okay. So what I'm going to do, I have one more question about AI. To make this work timing-wise, I'm going to cut the lightning round. So I hope that's okay.

Totally fine. Okay. I know AI is very top of my head. By the way, this is my diabolical plan to have to skip the lightning round because that's the thing I'm not good at. The guy just not. I'm not going to lose. Anyway, that's the thing I was dreading the most, playing 4D chess here. You knew exactly the timing and you're like, I will take this long, all these answers that will perfectly play out.

So now you're spending a lot of time on AI. It's on many people's minds these days. You built this product called ChatSpot. Is it still called ChatSpot or did you? Is that the product you changed the name for? That's still ChatSpot. It's still ChatSpot. Still ChatSpot. And I know that you've handed that off now to like a team actually that's working on this. It's not like just our mesh project anymore.

So I don't know exactly where to go with this, but just why is AI so top of mind? And where do you think people should be spending time? Where do you think things are heading? What comes to mind around AI? Yeah, it's obviously I'm not alone in my excitement, but I will say this. So I've been, so I'm about to hit the 30 year anniversary of my working in like commercial software, right? Like that's so I've been at this for a long, long time and that's all I've ever known. That's all I've ever done.

And the last time I was this both excited, I'll just excited because that was when the web first came along in the mid to late 90s. And I'm like, oh, like this literally like changed everything, right? It's like relevant to everything. It's like literally everything is going to be impacted by this thing called the internet. And I was in my early 20s, right? And I've been here for mobile. I've been here for social. I've seen lots of things that people got really excited about, but nothing to me has kind of hit the Richter scale to agree that AI does.

And the reason is, okay, so if you think about early computers or PCs that kind of gave us compute at scale, which was awesome. The internet effectively gave us kind of distribution at scale, allowed us to take information, products, whatever and get them out at scale because everything was now connected where before it was not. What AI gives us now is cognition at scale, the ability to kind of literally amplify the human brain, right? Like that's never been done before. Not that we haven't been trying, but now we have demonstrable evidence and products that actually work. We've used chat to PT and products like it. And so it's life changing, right?

And so for the product people out there, which is a lot of you, AI, so by the way, the internet unlocked a massive opportunity because especially for startups, right? It's like, oh, we can just reimagine the world with this new thing called the internet that was not possible a year ago and now is what can we kind of now unlock and lots of great companies that were created? I think something similar will happen here.

And there's a couple of things that I think that are just tactically that I think are possible vectors that kind of satisfy my spreadsheet of if I were gonna choose ideas and the supplies across industries is that, so as software companies and product builders, most of us have always called our products like, oh, we build intuitive products. Where's that good? And we say that, right? And it turns out, it's just not true because as a user of X product, whatever happens to be, it's like, okay, I've got this mental model, the thing I'm trying to accomplish. And then I have to translate that into a series of clicks and drags and touches and swipes in order to accomplish the thing that I want in the software product that I'm using.

And what varies is the degree to which that translation needs to occur. But there is this impedance mismatch, right? There's a translation that has to happen from the what's in my head, like, I wanna remove this background in Photoshop. I wanna create this report in HubSpot. And so the opportunity now is that we're going from what was an imperative model. This is what engineers would call like a step-by-step. You give instructions to the computer, like do this, do this, do this, do this. And then hopefully you get the outcome you're looking for to what engineers would call a declarative model.

A declarative model is you describe the outcome you want, not the steps to get there. And the closest analogy that most people are familiar with is SQL, the Korean language, right? So before SQL, if you wanted to get data out of a system, you wrote code that says, okay, loop over all my customer records and then filter out the ones that have less than a million dollars of revenue and then give me the result. And SQL said, no, just put a where clause on the describe the data you want and what columns you want and how do you wanna order it and what filters you wanna apply and it figures out, if the database figures out how to get you the thing that you're looking for.

Now we have the ability to do that for interfaces, for software, right? So instead of saying click here, drag here, it's like, I want you to generate a report that's all my customers in Europe that we signed up last quarter that were more than 100K in ARR. And you just literally take the thing that's in your head and express it in whatever medium you choose, text, voice, doesn't matter. And the software now can actually, so now the technology exists to pull that off. Did not exist before and now it exists.

I know it didn't exist before because six and a half years ago I built this product called GrowthBot. That was a chatbot for HubSpot software and business software, generally for marketing and sales people. It's essentially what ChatSpot is now. Amazing product, GrowthBot, and it had just one teeny tiny small problem which is it didn't work. Really well conceived, really like brilliant idea. It just didn't work and the technologies wasn't there, right? The use couldn't do it with any degree of fidelity because AI had, and now you can. 

And that's what kind of caused me to go, kind of prove out my theories like I had a chip on my shoulder, particularly with that idea, right? But I think, I'm not suggesting that web and mobile interfaces are gonna go away but there are a class of use cases across pretty much all software where we can make things easier for the human by not forcing that translation layer and just make it truly intuitive.

Yeah, so thank you for coming to my TED talk. I'm gonna have to get out of here.
