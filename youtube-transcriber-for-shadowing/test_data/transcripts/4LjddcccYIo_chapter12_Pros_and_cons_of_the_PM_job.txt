============================================================

[00:00] It reminds me of one of your lessons that you shared in one of your podcast episodes.
[00:04] It was one of your PM lessons of 2021, and the lesson was, when in doubt, it's your job
[00:10] as a PM, which I think relates very much to what you just shared.
[00:14] Can you speak to that?
[00:15] It might actually make sense to put this in the context of the other roles that
[00:18] are part of the team.
[00:19] So as an engineer, your job is to write the code to really reduce this doubt and
[00:25] build the thing and make it work to spec.
[00:28] As a designer, maybe your job is to design the thing, design the solution, design the
[00:32] user experience.
[00:33] Obviously, there's a lot more complexity in that role.
[00:36] Design your amazing engineering, your amazing TL, they are caveat, whatever.
[00:41] But as a PM, you don't have that thing, right?
[00:45] It's not like, oh, my job is just to write the one page or that's not true.
[00:48] Your job isn't just to pick the problem.
[00:50] Your job is to deliver a business result.
[00:52] And so you're uniquely positioned to have to fill in all the gaps because no one
[00:58] else is incentivized to do that.
[01:01] As an engineer, you can finish your work and hand it off and say, I did it.
[01:05] And the good ones care, but you don't have to care, right?
[01:09] As a PM, you're not going to do your job unless that problem gets solved for
[01:14] the customer or the user at the end of the day.
[01:16] And so your job is to make sure everything happens for that product.
[01:21] It reminds me of another interview you did where you talked about how a lot
[01:25] of the PM job sucks.
[01:27] It's not as glamorous as people often think.
[01:30] And most of the job is these really boring, annoying things.
[01:34] I guess, is there anything you want to add there of just like, you know,
[01:37] a lot of people want to get into PM or like, oh, I'm going to run the show.
[01:39] It's going to be so great.
[01:40] I'm going to be a product manager and tell people what to do.
[01:43] But that's not how it is.
[01:45] It's just one of those things that like people and when I joined
[01:49] products, it was just sort of becoming a cool job.
[01:53] It wasn't like the hot job on campus when I was in business school.
[01:56] That was more like private equity venture capital.
[01:59] And now there's a sense of cachet around it.
[02:03] But again, it comes back to that earlier point, which is you do get to do
[02:06] cool stuff.
[02:06] You get to decide what gets built.
[02:08] Like that's cool.
[02:09] You have a lot of ownership, like we talked about.
[02:11] You could see it as you have a lot of power.
[02:14] But at the same time, you're responsible.
[02:16] And so with that comes this responsibility to get it right, to make
[02:20] the right bets, ship the right products, get them out the door.
[02:23] And so there's a lot of bullshit work you have to do.
[02:27] Again, project management is what everyone hates on.
[02:29] QA is a really good one.
[02:31] You should QA your products.
[02:33] That's great if you have a QA team.
[02:35] You should QA them.
[02:35] You should know how they work.
[02:36] You should implement with your customers.
[02:38] You should be able to sell them.
[02:39] You should be able to find users.
[02:41] All that stuff is stuff that you should be able to do.
[02:44] And none of it is above you.
