Fences. Okay. Well, I have to follow this thread that you put out there of what the secret is to morality. What did you learn there? 

Well, my first one-on-one, I sat down with Elliot and I said, "Hey, I'm here to learn, please teach me everything that you know about morality." And he said, "Okay, well, hate to burst your bubble, but there is no such thing as a truly viral product." I said, "What do you mean? How do you explain Facebook? For that matter, how do you explain LinkedIn?" And he said, "What I mean is no app has sustained a viral factor of greater than one for any real period of time. Even Facebook in its heyday had a viral factor of about 0.7, and he told me that lasted for perhaps a year." So one person was creating about 0.7 new users. 

I double-clicked again and I said, "Well, Elliot, what about the address book import? This is one of the things that LinkedIn got famous or infamous for. You could import your address book and then it would spam/invite everyone who happens to be members of LinkedIn in your address book. And then eventually it would just invite everyone to LinkedIn." He said, "That's an amazing feature, but you have to remember not everyone is going to use it all the time. So even that feature had a lifetime viral factor of about 0.4. And that's considered good. So 0.4 is good for a viral feature. 0.6 is great. Something like 0.7 is absolutely incredible. You're in the stratosphere upward Facebook at that time." 

So I said, "Well, okay, all of these things by definition are going to peter out. There's going to be an asymptote. None of these viral mechanics keep on compounding, which actually makes sense. It would be a little absurd if things just kept on growing. What then is the true secret behind virality?" And he said, "It is word of mouth. It is the virality you can't measure that isn't a mechanic that isn't in a feature. It is when one user spontaneously tells another user about your product." And that really colored how I think about growth and virality. Since then, it has shaped so much of what we do at Superhuman and so much of how I think about growing brands. 

Wow. You're such a great storyteller. I'm just like listening here, captivated. What is he going to say next? That was fascinating. I actually have a post that I'm going to that very much aligns with what you're talking about, which is titled "Viralities of Myth." Mostly. And it's based on, I forget it on this book where they do all this research on like actual viruses. And it turns out they're not actually spreading in this like exponential way. There's like one person that spreads it to a lot of people and it keeps happening. And that's actually apparently what the data shows. 

And I'm curious if you found this same thing, which is when people think of an app going viral, it's like one person with a massive platform sharing it. And their audience adopts it. And it's like, that's just one to many. And then it just happens a couple of times and it looks like it's going viral, but it's like a person to many people, not many people to many people. Thoughts on that? 

Yeah, we've definitely found that there are whales, to use the gaming terminology, that one person is going to be responsible for inviting 25, 50, a hundred people. And they may have various motivations for doing that. In Superhuman, as an individual subscriber, if you refer somebody else and they sign up, you both get a free month, which is a great incentive if you're paying out of pocket. So we have people who send many, many hundreds of invites, and there are some people who essentially have free Superhuman for life now, due to how many people they've invited. But of course, that incentive doesn't necessarily work inside of a company or inside of a team where ultimately it's the company paying for the product. So you have to then come up with new motivations for the.
