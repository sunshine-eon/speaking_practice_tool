============================================================

On board. Such a great lesson. Just a few more questions. You mentioned that you launched on Twitter and that led to a large waitlist and a growing waitlist. Is there anything you did before that to kind of build this following? You know, that sounds like really amazing. Cool. We just announced that on Twitter and we have this large waitlist and then we grow and we get all these customers. Is there anything you did ahead of time in anticipation of this launch? Would you recommend people work on building some kind of following online before they were going to start it? Was it just like, hey, we happen to have this kind of following and it worked out? Anything along those lines you would recommend to founders these days?

Yeah, I mean, I think definitely if you have a following and like, I hope it depends what kind of following, but I think like my background as a designer, I would say like at Airbnb and Coinbase and other places and I did some like talks and conferences and wrote some blog posts. So I was definitely like out there and then kind of had some of that following, which was helpful, but it wasn't like I have like thousands of like hundreds of thousands of followers or millions or something. I had maybe like 10,000 or something, which is like a significant number.

But then I think like the other thing is, I think with the announcement, like one of the things we did, I think, well, it's like, I think sometimes startups do try to like emulate successful large companies too much. And you kind of like do this like fancy announcements where it's like, hey, now we're like doing this fancy thing. And then it's like sounds very like corporate or something. And I think with that, with our announcement, we tried to write it more like direct or authentic to us. Like this is like what are we going to do? And this is why I'm like this, these are some of the things we're going to do.

Then on Twitter, we did the same thing, like all of us founders, we wrote our own reasons why we're doing this. And I think it was like just much more like, and I think like people could, people like us could resonate more with it. So we were kind of writing to the right audience. And like, I think that's probably the first thing you're like, when you're announcing your company, it's like, you think about like, who is my first audience? Like, who would be the best users, like early users for this product? And like, where are they? And then like, how do they think about things? And like, what kind of language they use?

So for us, it was like, it came very naturally because we are these people, we're in building software and these companies. And we've seen, like other people have seen similar things we have seen. So I think that the way we announced it like resonated with a lot of people. And then I think we did have some friends. And as I said, like, we got some data like angel round, where we got some like friends involved. 

The main reason we did it was that we just felt like it's in the early days, it's good to have like, you feel like a real company in a way that like you have someone to answer for in a way, even though the investors normally run your company, or they don't have that much power, it's more like, oh, I took someone's money, so I now need to like make it worth it kind of. But then like, I think with the announcement again, like we could use some of those people to like, spread the message as well.
