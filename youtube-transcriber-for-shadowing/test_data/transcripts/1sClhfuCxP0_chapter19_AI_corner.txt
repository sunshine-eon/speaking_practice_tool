============================================================

[00:00] Okay, let's go to AI Corner, something I'm trying to do with every guest.
[00:04] Is there anything you've learned about working with AI that you think might be helpful to listeners?
[00:09] Yeah, I think a couple of things.
[00:11] I think working with AI, many, many, many teams and companies get too excited about AI
[00:18] and the possibilities and so on.
[00:19] And it's almost like a solution where you find a problem within their companies,
[00:23] which also is fine because now you're thinking about possibilities on what this particular technology
[00:29] can do for my company.
[00:30] So it's a good way to start.
[00:32] But many people don't actually use it in the best way possible and force fit it.
[00:39] Instead of that, you can think about how do I get AI to work with AI?
[00:44] And again, it's connecting back with and this is something that as we see,
[00:48] I invented this term called H.I.
[00:49] Just to make sure that everybody understands artificial intelligence is
[00:53] intelligence is important as much as human intelligence.
[00:56] And if you're not humanly intelligent, you're not going to be artificially intelligent.
[01:01] Yeah, I really help your company a lot.
[01:04] So literally any product that you're building, even when it is technologically, you know,
[01:10] quite interesting and exciting and so on, it needs to be balanced out and work together
[01:15] along with a great UX along with behavioral science.
[01:18] And the combination of those two will actually make sure that that you're getting the best outcome of that
[01:24] unless you're building something which is like completely vacuum with no human intervention or
[01:28] consumer products largely.
