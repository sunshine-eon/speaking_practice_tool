============================================================

To kind of close out our conversation, just a couple more broad questions. You have a pretty unique culture at Linear. One fun thing that you do is have this baking competition. Can you talk about that and what you do there?

Yeah. So since we are a fully remote and distributed company, we have people in Europe and the US, which makes group gatherings quite challenging due to the different time zones. Basic things like happy hours don’t really work well, and Zoom happy hours are probably not that fun anyway. So, we thought about doing something inspired by the Great British Baking Show, which many people in the company enjoy. We decided to pick a recipe—initially just baking, but we’ve since expanded to cooking recipes too.

We choose a recipe that is reasonable to complete in a couple of hours and doesn’t require tons of equipment or skill. Then, we tell everyone to buy the ingredients using the company card. Everyone has a company card, so that’s easy. We hop on Zoom on a designated day, and for me, it’s usually around 8 AM in California. We start baking or cooking together, making things like roll cakes, lemon meringue pies, and pastel de nata, which is a Portuguese pastry.

During the session, everyone follows the recipe while chatting. Some people have questions like, “Hey, I’m stuck with this,” or “My dough looks weird. Does yours look like this?” It creates a nice environment where people can help each other while also chatting about random topics. Once we finish, everyone takes pictures of their creations and posts them in a Slack channel to showcase what they achieved. We also have friendly competitions to see who did it better or who had the best presentation. Some people put a lot of effort into decorations and visuals, which makes it a fun craft activity.

We’ve been doing this quarterly since the beginning of the company. Recently, we decided to keep it simpler due to time constraints, so we did a summer drink recipe instead. People made matcha drinks, coconut drinks, iced tea, and other refreshing beverages, which was interesting to try.

Have you ever won one of these competitions yourself? 

We don’t really declare winners that much, but I do think that, as a designer, I have some advantages in visual presentation. I generally do well in that area. With this remote competition, the visual aspect is the only thing you can really judge since you can’t taste the food through Zoom.
