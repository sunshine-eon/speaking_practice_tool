[00:00] So, is that advice you often give of go deep into a company or product versus just bounce
[00:05] and try a bunch of different companies or depends?
[00:08] It depends.

[00:58] but I definitely went deep.
[01:00] And I think there's pros and cons, but there's so many pros to that, so many reasons.
