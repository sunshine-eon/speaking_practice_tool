============================================================

[00:00] Cool. Does there anything that we haven't covered that you wanted to cover?
[00:04] Is there any last piece of wisdom you want to leave listeners with before we let you go?
[00:11] I feel good. So I think we covered a lot.
[00:15] Thank you for asking amazing questions.
[00:17] This was really fun.
[00:18] This was incredible.
[00:19] Okay. So let me just ask you this then.
[00:21] Where can folks find you online?
[00:23] Where can they check out?
[00:23] Superhuman, what should they know before they try it out?
[00:27] And then just how can listeners be useful to you?
[00:30] If you want to find me online, I'm generally on X, that is x.com slash Rahul Vora, R-A-H-U-L-V-O-H-R-A.
[00:38] And my DMs are open.
[00:39] So for your feedback to ping me, if you're going to do that, I would suggest also emailing me.
[00:44] That's rahul at superhuman.com.
[00:48] And hopefully I'll see your message soon.
[00:50] If you haven't tried Superhuman, then gosh, what are you doing?
[00:55] I think this is my call to you to do so because your time is worth more than whatever you think it might be.
[01:01] So go download Superhuman and give it a shot.
[01:04] Invite your team.
[01:06] The metrics are real.
[01:07] I know they sound like the kind of metrics that startups make up, but getting through your email twice as fast,
[01:12] responding once to two days sooner, saving four hours or more every single week.
[01:18] They're all real.
[01:19] Actually, speaking of which, the consulting firm I mentioned earlier,
[01:24] because they're so into data and into analysis, they wanted to corroborate those numbers for themselves.
[01:31] And so they did.
[01:32] They ran their own internal case study on Superhuman and they were like, yeah, you're saving our partners 3.3 hours per person per week.
[01:41] And there's only one other tool that we've bought that does that, which is chat GPT.
[01:46] So thank you.
[01:46] We love Superhuman.
[01:47] We're rolling it out.
[01:48] If that sounds interesting to you or your company, please do give it a shot.
[01:53] That is super cool.
[01:55] Reflecting back on what I imagine this conversation would look like, a lot of contrarian thinking and attention to detail.
[02:01] I think that's exactly what it was.
[02:03] Really awesome.
[02:04] Thank you so much for being here.
[02:06] Thank you.
[02:07] Bye, everyone.
