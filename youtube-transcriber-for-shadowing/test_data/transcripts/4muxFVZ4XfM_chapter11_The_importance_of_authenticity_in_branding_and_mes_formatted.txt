============================================================

Is there anything you've learned about just building a brand over the course of building Linear? Something you find to be really important in actually building that perception of Linear is really great and amazing? To me, I think the brand should always be authentic. Even if people can't articulate it, they start to feel like something is off.

There can be companies or startups that think about brands as just the logo or the colors of the website. They might do the same thing that some other company does and think, "Okay, now we have a brand." But they actually didn't consider what their brand truly is—what is the message or voice they want to convey? Also, the brand doesn't happen overnight. When you start a company, you don't have a brand. You have to create it over time through the things you do, the things you say, how you say them, and how you approach various situations.

How you treat customers, how you build the website or the product—all of these elements contribute to the idea of what this company means to people in their minds. I know we both worked at Airbnb, and I think for Brian Chesky, the brand was probably the most important thing. I can't imagine how many hours, meetings, or conversations there were about the brand. It was always a part of everything the company did.

It's true that you could book places to stay in many locations on the web, but when people think about wanting to stay in a cool place, they think about Airbnb. They don't think about those other options. That's the power of the brand—it makes people stop considering alternatives and understand that this is the go-to option for that experience. 

This is part of the reason Airbnb has been able to build a direct destination. People aren't Googling "I want to stay in a home"; they are going straight to Airbnb.com. This gives Airbnb a massive advantage, as they don't have to run ads on platforms like Facebook and Google or rely heavily on SEO. People simply know Airbnb, and they go straight there. There are very few sites where people think, "I'm going to go straight there" while knowing they can also compare hotels on other sites.
