============================================================

Yeah, absolutely. Okay, so let's move to your sweet spot, which is the talent solution product. Is that what it's called? 

Yeah, so it's basically any product on LinkedIn that helps you get a job or learn a skill. We have products for recruiters and hires, jobs, and products for job seekers. We also have LinkedIn Learning, and we run a pretty large creator ecosystem for instructors who post content in LinkedIn Learning. 

And is it true that this is the biggest business within LinkedIn? 

It is a very big business within LinkedIn, and it's certainly something that, again, if you go back to that vision of connecting people to opportunity, it's very much core to how people get jobs and learn skills. 

So the feed gets all the glory and you guys are making all the money. 

I would not say that. But again, we joke about those things, and it's so hard at LinkedIn to separate one product from the other. It's really kind of the way we run, the way we think about the product, and the way we build. 

Let me just give you a super concrete example of that. Certainly, if you have someone coming in and looking at the feed, one thing we might do is suggest a job recommendation based on what they're looking for in that feed. Part of what we have to do is think about how someone who's looking at something in their interest might be driving their job-seeking experience as well. 

When they're looking for a job, it's very important that they know how they can actually get connected in that job. The relationships of the network you build are very much part of that flywheel that goes into it. Even as we start looking at this, you might be looking at a subject and then want to go deeper on it, and there's a course that comes into it as well, right? 

All of this to me is a very connected ecosystem on how those items work together in order to give people opportunity. We certainly have, I think from the outside, very different things, but inside, even the way we operate and think about it, it's a very connected ecosystem. 

What are the components again of this part of the org? 

We think about it as two different marketplaces. There's a hiring marketplace, which is how we connect job seekers with recruiters and hiring managers, and then there's a learning marketplace, which is how we connect learners to instructors. 

Got it. And then within hiring, are there sub-components? 

Yeah, so again, we really think about it as a marketplace where we're generally organized around seekers and hires. There's a team that's kind of working on recruiters, which is probably one of the more flagship products that LinkedIn is always better at. There's a team working on jobs, which is if you ever post a job on LinkedIn, and then a team working to always help job seekers make sure they connect. 

On the other side, for learners and instructors, there's a team working on LinkedIn Learning, which is one of the bigger enterprise learning products in the world, and then a team working to help instructors. Many people don't know this, but we should have two large film studios. We bring in instructors, we film a lot of content, and we have ones in Europe and ones in Santa Barbara, all through the Linda acquisition. We have a large team of content creators and teams that include everyone from makeup artists to scriptwriters that we get to use over there. 

Wow, it's just marketplaces all the way down as you talk about this. Hiring marketplace, learning marketplace, the feed itself, probably more I'm not thinking about. 

Yeah, it's very much, I mean, one model that we sometimes use internally is how do we operate as marketplaces inside an ecosystem. I think it kind of speaks to the complexity again of the product and hopefully how we might operate it.
