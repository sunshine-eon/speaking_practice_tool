============================================================

[00:00] There's something you said kind of along these lines that I think is important that
[00:04] one of the things that gets you excited about what you're building is giving people superpowers
[00:09] and especially people that don't have a code, basically 99% of people.
[00:13] Is there anything along those lines that you think is important to share?
[00:16] It's very clear to most people who have been engineers or been founders that there's
[00:23] so many that have failed in their endeavors because they didn't have someone that know
[00:27] how to solve the technical parts.
[00:29] And now that we're close to having people know that this was like, not that it was
[00:36] exist and they work, they solve everything.
[00:38] And it's going to be an explosion of like entrepreneurship and better software
[00:46] product. We're not going to settle for all the annoying, bad technology that
[00:53] we use today. And everyone who has an idea is going to say like, okay, I'm going to
[01:02] build this thing and show you that this is the best, this is the best version of the
[01:07] product or what our company should be doing instead of having long meetings or like writing
[01:12] up documents. So it's going to be empowering across a lot of different
[01:18] professions and places.
