Time: 69:38 - 78:57
============================================================

[00:00] thanks to your sharing. Amazing. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you
[00:05] ready? All set. Let's do it. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most
[00:13] to other people? It keeps changing a lot, but my books are usually around understanding human
[00:19] behavior and I keep changing based on the person, but I think it's the biggest subject. All our
[00:25] customers, all our investors, all our employees, all our relationships are all humans and the
[00:31] subject that we are weakest on is human behavior. And how do we live this life? Playing life on
[00:36] extremely hard mode if you don't learn human behavior. So I would say that's one thing.
[00:40] The second thing is evolutionary biology. It teaches a lot about how species evolve and how
[00:45] do they make decisions and what are the core motivations that drive everybody. So that's
[00:50] another one I would recommend. And I don't make recommendations because I can barely finish a
[00:56] book to be honest. So I believe in drifting and getting deeper into topics or understand the
[01:02] topics versus trying to say, give me these three books and I'm going to be good. And the last
[01:06] one I would say is that anything that can make you learn something about their journey versus
[01:14] their success. So sometimes autobiographies are too celebratory in some ways, but if you can just
[01:21] kind of understand how they, how did they, if any book can teach you how people recover from a set
[01:28] back in great detail is a great book to learn from. And audience member on Twitter actually
[01:35] asked a similar question along these lines. If there's one book that you could
[01:39] read over and over and over, what would that be? Is there one? I
[01:43] absolutely don't believe in reading over and over because I believe that we are evolving things.
[01:51] You might discover the same stuff coming from different books and you would say,
[01:54] oh, I can categorize this in my brain again and again. But I think we should, we tend to become
[02:03] believers in, it becomes too religious if we repeat. Yeah.
[02:10] Next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?
[02:16] I love Oppenheimer because of these struggles and Nolan's craft of making the movies,
[02:22] but nothing in the recent past that I feel is right up there.
[02:27] Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?
[02:33] I like to ask a hypothetical second order thinking question. For example,
[02:38] if everybody who has taken a COVID vaccine dies tonight, what happens in 12 months from now?
[02:45] Can you explain the world from what happens to money, what happens to law,
[02:50] what happens to countries, what happens to military, what happens to
[02:53] stock market, what happens to order of things? And I would say less than 10% of really smart
[03:02] people can really have good answers. So it tells you how good they are in second order thinking.
[03:09] But the question is going to keep changing. For example, we said that
[03:12] what if arranged marriages were banned in India, made, made, got capital punishment for
[03:17] doing arranged marriages? What happens to the country? How do we change from there?
[03:23] Like some absurd scenarios, but then what happens after that?
[03:27] Not to give away your secret sauce, but what do you look for in an answer that gives you
[03:30] sense there? The range of things that they could go into and think about if this happens,
[03:37] be happens and then see happens, like the leaves they could make.
[03:42] And just so people understand when you're talking about second order thinking,
[03:45] what's the simplest way to describe that concept?
[03:48] I think the simplest way to think about this is that being able to correctly judge
[03:54] the butterfly effect of an event in as close as possible. For example,
[04:01] okay, like a lot of people in stock market use that to say how which stocks will go up and down.
[04:06] There's something that has happened in the market. Oh, there is a war now in Russia,
[04:12] then what happens to the market? Can you be good at predicting that?
[04:16] But in everything in life, if this happens and a lot of people hate this because it's
[04:22] very taxing to the brain, brain absolutely hates second order thinking,
[04:27] unless you've trained your brain with second order thinking all the time that it looks forward to it.
[04:32] So you're going to convert this into a hate versus a reward cycle, and that comes with
[04:38] probably doing it probably early on in your life. Later on people hate doing second order
[04:43] thinking. Yes, that sounds like a lot of work for the brain.
[04:47] Okay, just a few more questions. Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered
[04:53] that you really love? I'm looking forward to my vision for that is coming soon.
[04:59] It's a future favorite product. We have actually Boz from Meta coming on as the next
[05:03] guest in my recording. I'm not sure when they come out in sequence, but we're going to talk about
[05:07] his thoughts. Yeah, the most fascinating thing that I saw was Zach talking about the utility of
[05:16] Meta being better than Vision Pro and their product. And that's exactly going to work well
[05:24] for Apple because when you try to make the product more utilitarian, it loses status.
[05:30] And if you study animals, you realize that the one which gets the highest mating success
[05:35] is the one which can demonstrate ability to waste resources and not be very efficient with
[05:40] resources. And therefore, people who are known to buy a product that is wasteful
[05:46] will actually own higher status. And I think Zach made it actually quite easy for Apple to
[05:51] demonstrate their superior positioning by saying that, oh, we are not as efficient,
[05:56] we are not as cheap, we are not for everybody. Wow, just continue to blow minds even on our
[06:01] lightning round. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share
[06:09] with friends and family find useful in worker in life? It's not a favorite motto, but I think
[06:15] we truly are transient. And we are very lucky to have this life that we have and we have to make
[06:21] the most out of it. And all these struggles will mean nothing. I often tell people that
[06:29] wish for your life to be so great that you have collected the highest amount of content
[06:33] when you are old, you have no end to the stories that you can talk about.
[06:37] That reminds me of a book I once read that really had an impact on me where
[06:41] somebody was trying to make a movie of their life and the producer was like, there's nothing,
[06:46] there's no good movie here. You have not done enough interesting things. I love it.
[06:50] And so he actually became, he turned his lens into what to do in life by thinking what would
[06:55] make a great story. And so he just started to do and a great story, something where you
[07:00] overcome challenges and achieve something you wanted. And so that became his life
[07:04] motto. I'm going to try hard things and overcome them. And that's going to be-
[07:08] I love it. I love it. I love it.
[07:10] I'll link to that book in the show notes. Final question.
[07:13] You have this series on Twitter that you call Monday Motivations.
[07:18] I'm curious what's motivating you these days?
[07:20] I find interest filled with all these people trying to give this fake motivation and make
[07:25] money off that stuff. And it's almost like a drug for people to feel, oh my God,
[07:30] there's motivation I'm going to do well. I just want to remind people that all success come from
[07:36] extraordinary amount of pain and struggle and hard work. And there is no shortcut to
[07:41] anything material coming in life. And so the Monday Motivation post comes as the
[07:47] anti-motivation post because the world has filled with- I believe that the biggest profit
[07:55] making scheme that I've seen in recent times is to tell people to love themselves and
[07:59] they'll pay you money for saying that. And I think the best way to love yourself is to keep
[08:05] evolving. So my motivation comes from evolution, connecting dots, solving harder problems than
[08:12] I have solved in the past. And I think life is ultimately a game that you want to feel that
[08:17] your levels have changed and your skills have changed constantly.
[08:21] Kunal, you are wonderful. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions.
