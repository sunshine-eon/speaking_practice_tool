============================================================

There's so many interesting lessons from this. I wanted to ask how you got your first 10 customers, and what I'm hearing essentially was from this waitlist. You launched it on Twitter, people signed up, you picked people to let on board. You worked with them over the course of a year to make it what they needed and then eventually started charging.

Yeah. I think the first 10 companies using it, I think maybe a little over a half. Maybe there was three friends that have startups and they used it, and then I think the majority of them were just from this waitlist, but they didn't like pay us anything. We didn't have pricing in the beginning or during the private beta. 

At some point, we started building the payments function, so we just added a page in the settings that you can optionally pay. Then we just gave you a slider that asked how much do you want to pay per seat. We saw that some people paid like $28 per seat and some people paid like $1. But it doesn't really matter; we just wanted to test the functionality and see what people thought.

Then after a year, when we launched, we already had the first week of launching, and we probably had some hundreds of customers. I've never heard of the approach to pricing as just an actual sliding scale where people can slide the scale themselves and decide how much they want to pay. Did that help you figure out what to charge, or was it mostly just an experiment?

I don't think it gave us enough data to decide. But I think it was good to see that there were some people that went for it. I think that $20 was probably the maximum that people could pay, so there were some people that went to it and felt like, actually, I really love the product, and I'm happy to pay like $28. I think at least it gave us some confidence that if we charge for this and it's something under $20, there's going to be a market.
