============================================================

[10:12] hopefully the product will continue to deliver.
[10:14] Do you know if there's any product changes
[10:17] that have most contributed to that feed
[10:19] becoming much more interesting?
[10:21] Well, there's a couple of things that I think are
[10:24] very special that we're working on.
[10:26] And it's hard to say which is most
[10:27] because a lot of these things obviously accumulate
[10:30] and compound over time.
[10:31] But certainly there's a lot of machine learning
[10:34] and algorithms that go behind these systems.
[10:36] And many of them, as we've started understanding,
[10:39] these are things that people get value by.
[10:41] It's about how do we make sure
[10:43] that we're giving people that interesting knowledge.
[10:45] And as we've gotten crisper on what that means,
[10:47] I think we've been better able to build towards it.
[10:50] The other one, which is new,
[10:51] but I'm just particularly excited about,
[10:53] we're starting to do a lot of things
[10:54] which are Gen AI assisted, right?
[10:56] So you basically can come in and get some prompts
[10:58] and people can bribe their perspective on that.
[11:00] And I think that combination, it's very early,
[11:03] but it's very exciting on how we might be able
[11:05] to help people unlock knowledge
[11:06] for some reason, billion people now on the platform,
[11:08] knowledge of those billion people in a way
[11:10] that people can find and see.
