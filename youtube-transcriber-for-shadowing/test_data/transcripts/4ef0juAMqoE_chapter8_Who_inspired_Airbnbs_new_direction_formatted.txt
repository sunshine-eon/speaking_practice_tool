============================================================

Is it was now late 2019. I don't know what to do. I'm like, the product is slow, the app seems not changed, costs are rising, and I keep adding more people. There seems to be more politics—by politics, I mean advocating for individual interests rather than the whole of the company. More bureaucracy means meetings about meetings about meetings and a lot of dependencies. People were describing working 80 hours and getting 20 hours of productive work done, which is just a crazy ratio for a week. I didn't really quite know what to do.

Then, right before the pandemic, I met two people who really affected how I thought about things. The first is Heroki Asai. Heroki now works at Airbnb; he's one of my executives, and actually, product design, product marketing design, and marketing report into him. He was a creative director for Apple, working closely with Steve Jobs for many years. He came from graphic design and eventually ran all of marketing communications at Apple. They designed the app and all the marketing touchpoints for the store. It wasn't just ads; they were responsible for every brand touchpoint. Everything flowed through marketing, which became the governing factor that made everything really organized.

I also re-acquainted myself with a person named Johnny Ive. Johnny was the head of industrial design and then chief design officer at Apple. They described a way of running a company that was totally different from how I was running mine. It was basically the way that Steve Jobs ran Apple from about 1998 until he died in 2011. Apple somewhat runs this way today, but the ARV semi-divisional services are turning into divisions, and they are just so big that I think it’s not a one-to-one anymore. However, they still technically run this way.

I had this image of not being divisional, as we were running with 10 divisions. We had a flights division, a homes division divided into pro hosts, core hosts, and Lux. We had business travel, a magazine, experiences, .org, and China. So, we had these 10 different divisions all going in different directions. I created a culture where everyone would be a business manager or a general manager, which made them want to create many general managers. The company kept getting subdivided, making it very difficult to turn in. This was all about me delegating responsibility.

The problem is, if you're running a divisional company, you're a product-like founder. What are you doing? My job went from proactive to very reactive. I was reacting to a lot of things and found myself in many meetings, trying to adjudicate different issues.
