============================================================

[00:00] and think ahead, because they're not
[00:02] required to build code all day in design.
[00:05] This is the advantage you have as a PM.
[00:07] I always think that PMs often don't really
[00:09] have any special unique skills.
[00:11] They just have the time to do the things that nobody else wants
[00:14] to do or can't, or doesn't have the time to do
[00:17] or doesn't want to do.
[00:18] And just this really important point
[00:20] of just spending the time to think and not just constantly
[00:23] try to discuss things in meetings
[00:25] or, like you said, just Google around for answers
[00:28] that ends up being incredibly important.
[00:30] And I just love this framework of just starting
[00:32] a doc with a little question at the top
[00:34] and just sit there and try to answer
[00:35] the question on your own before doing anything.
[00:37] I think that's a really good approach.
[00:39] I want to ask how you actually do that.
[00:41] How do you actually create these blocks of time?
[00:43] There's this concept of deep work
[00:45] and how valuable it is to creative work and knowledge work.
[00:49] How do you do that for yourself?
[00:50] How do you block out time and not get bugged all day?
[00:53] Because we're like really anti-meeting at Ramp,
[00:58] I had time in my calendar.
[01:00] And so what I would basically do is,
[01:02] the Friday before I kind of clocked out,
[01:06] I would look at the next week,
[01:08] I would look at the top questions
[01:11] that I needed to spend time thinking about
[01:13] and then I would block out that time.
[01:15] I also work on one day of the weekend
[01:20] in terms of deep work.
[01:21] I find that hanging out outside
[01:24] and dooling on my piece of paper,
[01:27] some thoughts is actually really refreshing
[01:30] because it doesn't feel like work.
[01:31] It feels like just me just philosophizing about something.
[01:35] And so yeah, blocking out that time,
[01:36] finding a space where things are less busy,
[01:39] where you're not in the critical path
[01:40] either early mornings or later afternoons
[01:44] or a day on the weekend is the best path for it.
[01:48] What do you do if someone wants to actually
[01:49] schedule a meeting with you
[01:50] or reach out or put some on your calendars
[01:52] or give a kind of policy there to protect that time?
[01:55] I think that I should never really be
[01:57] in the critical path of anything.
[02:00] So largely I'm not available,
[02:03] but if they really need to get to me
[02:05] that they have my phone number.
[02:07] Cool.
[02:08] The thing that I found really valuable
[02:09] is just on a Wednesday mornings and Friday mornings,
[02:12] I just have this huge block called Deep Work Time.
[02:14] If you book a time during this time, I will slap you.
[02:18] And I don't know if I'll.
