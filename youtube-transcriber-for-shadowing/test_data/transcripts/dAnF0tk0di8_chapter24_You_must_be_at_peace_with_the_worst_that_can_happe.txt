============================================================

[00:00] just to say it's going to work.
[00:01] I mean, you could follow all those things
[00:03] and it could just completely fall apart
[00:05] and it probably will.
[00:07] It's just the reality.
[00:08] And I think something we use at 37 Signals,
[00:11] David kind of taught me this.
[00:12] It's really a stoic thing,
[00:13] which is just idea of negative visualization.
[00:16] Like what's the worst that can happen?
[00:18] You got to be at peace with the worst that can happen.
[00:23] And just like role play that and go, what's the worst?
[00:26] Like for example, we're doing these new once products.
[00:29] What's the worst that can happen?
[00:30] Well, the once model is totally different.
[00:32] It's not SaaS, it's you pay once,
[00:34] you download the software, you install on your own server.
[00:36] Like we're putting a lot of effort into this.
[00:38] This could be like the wrong time to do it.
[00:40] It could be a total flop.
[00:41] This could not find any traction in the market.
[00:44] So what's the worst that can happen?
[00:45] Well, we spent six months exploring something
[00:48] and having a really good time doing it.
[00:50] Our margins are there, so we can do it.
[00:52] I wouldn't suggest someone does this
[00:53] if they can't afford to do it.
[00:55] But we know this might not work.
[00:57] And we're already at peace
[00:59] with the fact that this might not work.
[01:01] That's I think how you ultimately are able to move forward
[01:05] is to be at peace with knowing what's gonna happen
[01:08] if it doesn't work out.
