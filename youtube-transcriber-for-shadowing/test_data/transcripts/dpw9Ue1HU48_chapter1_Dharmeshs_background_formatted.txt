============================================================

Some of the best startup advice I've heard is that startups should focus on one thing and be really, really exceptionally world-class at that one thing. However, one of our early zigs was to do exactly the opposite of that. You have no direct reports, and I don't believe you've ever had direct reports at Outspot. I could become passively okay at management with some training and coaching, but I don't want to spend any years of my life becoming passively okay at something.

What was that process like to define the culture? My co-founder and I were having a lot of our founders meetings, and he said, "Oh, Darmesh, I hear this culture thing is really important. By the way, can you go do that?" I thought, okay, right. All the people and all of me felt like I was the worst possible person for this task. It's not that I don't like people; I just don't like being around them a whole lot.

Something that's really unique and interesting about you is your obsession with comedy and keynote presentations. It comes down to this metric that stand-up comedians use called LPM—laughs per minute. I have custom software that I've written that will say, "Okay, here are the points at which the audience laughed."

Today, my guest is Darmesh Shah. Darmesh is the co-founder and CTO of HubSpot and also one of the most fascinating and first-principled thinkers I've ever met. In our conversation, we cover a lot of ground. Darmesh's hilarious and ingenious approach to putting together a talk, including measuring laughs per minute, his biggest lessons from being a public company exec for over 10 years now, especially while being a startup guy at heart, and how he approached creating and scaling the culture of HubSpot, which you'll find both hilarious and inspiring.

We also discuss why founders and product teams are all fighting the second law of thermodynamics at a zig while everyone else is zagging, how and why Darmesh leans into his strengths, including never having a single direct report during his 18 years of running HubSpot, and so much more. This episode is so fun and will expand your mind in many ways.
