============================================================

Maybe spending a little more time here is smart. You're probably not going to be able to do a lot about grit or influence. Is there anything you can share about what you've seen most helps people develop these skills, other than just doing the job for a while and starting to get better at it? 

I think even smartness is something that can be very achievable. You don't need to be outstanding at that. For example, domain knowledge is crucial. An average smart person with no domain knowledge versus you, armed with a lot of knowledge around the domain, can already make better decisions. The first aspect is really about decision-making, problem identification, and problem-solving. I believe these skills can be developed to a level where you are very effective.

Drive, however, is probably the hardest to coach. I've not seen people with less drive eventually turning out with a lot of drive. They can be inspired, but it's a challenge. You need to be a person who can think about it that way. 

The third aspect is influence, which is non-negotiable. You need to really think that you have to be good at this one. There's another framework that I wanted to discuss regarding product leadership and how to think about different people in that context. When is it a product management problem, and when is it a problem with the company?
