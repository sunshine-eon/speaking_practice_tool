============================================================

Let's transition to the third area I wanted to spend some time on, which is growth. I'd love to understand how Linear grows and what you've figured out around growth, especially in B2B SaaS. 

So, first question here is: how long did it take from starting to work on Linear to launching, say, version one—something that a number of people can use? We started officially in 2019. Some months before that, we were already exploring and prototyping the product. It wasn't just a straightforward process; we prototyped different kinds of designs. One of the key things we wanted to solve was making the application really fast. We figured out that we could achieve this by using a local-based data structure where all the data lives on the client side, which then gets synced to the backend with delta packets. 

Back then, we were exploring various off-the-shelf solutions and systems, but nothing really met our needs. So, we ended up building our own solution. We spent some time prototyping that, and once we officially started working on the company in April 2019, we announced it around mid-April. We had a little website up with a waitlist, and by May, we could use it ourselves. We started inviting some friends to try it out, and by June, we began inviting people from the waitlist. Around June and July, we had about 100 to 200 users and maybe around 10 companies using it. 

We were in this private beta stage for almost a year. The way we managed it was by having a waitlist with a few survey questions, such as what tools they used and why they wanted to use Linear, along with their company size. We invited people based on their responses, focusing on smaller companies using the tools we currently supported. We also tried to gauge who was genuinely interested versus those who were just curious. A year later, in June, we launched publicly, and by then, we had several hundred companies using it. We also launched the pricing, and almost everyone subscribed to the paid plan, except for maybe one company.

There's a number of really interesting things here. You were in private beta for a year, and then a year later, you launched. How long was that period between starting to incubate and starting to build to that private beta milestone? I think it was just a few months—just a few months of building the version one. 

Wow, okay. I thought it was a lot longer; that is so interesting. What a team you've got over there! The survey piece is really interesting too. I've heard a little bit about the story. Essentially, you launched it on Twitter, and your founders had a bit of a following, which helped build up the initial waitlist. But what you did wasn't just a simple sign-up for a waitlist; you included a survey asking about the tools they used, like GitHub or something else, along with the size of the company and their interest. This helped you prioritize who to onboard, right?

Yes, exactly. The reason we did it was that we knew we didn't support everything. As I mentioned before, we wanted to focus on building a version that could work for some people or companies without trying to address everyone in the world in the first months of the business. It was a very selective process. We were fortunate to get people to sign up for the waitlist, and after about a month, we had around 4,000 people on it. Initially, it was a very manual process, but eventually, we built an invite tool to send invites. 

In the beginning, I would read the actual surveys in a spreadsheet, copy the emails, and send them the invite link from my personal email. I would follow up with them after a few days or a week to ask what they thought. We only invited about 10 people a week at first, gradually increasing that number. The reason we did it this way was that we thought if we invited everyone at once, they would likely encounter the same problems in this early-stage software. They would all send us feedback about the same issues, which felt like a waste of effort. 

So, we decided to do it in cohorts. We would invite a group of people, gather their feedback, fix any problems they reported, and then invite the next cohort. This approach allowed us to address issues more effectively and made the initial development process much smoother than if we had let everyone use the product right from the beginning.
