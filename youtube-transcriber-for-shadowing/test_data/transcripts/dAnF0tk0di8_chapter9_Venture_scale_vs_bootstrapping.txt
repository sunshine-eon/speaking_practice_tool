============================================================

[00:00] Coming back to this as a path people can take with their business versus a traditional venture scale business.
[00:08] So this path is essentially build something, sell it, make money, live like a chill life,
[00:15] not super stressed, growth focused, obsessed, need to build a billion dollar company.
[00:19] Do you think this path is something everyone should do? Is it specific type of personality, specific type of product?
[00:26] Do you recommend people that are, I don't know, sometimes do go this big shot venture scale route?
[00:31] I'm glad there are some people who do that.
[00:33] I mean, I'm glad that there's some businesses that wouldn't have worked out had they not taken a much of funding and went big, clearly.
[00:39] And there's many impressive businesses that do that.
[00:42] But let's face it, those are extreme outliers.
[00:45] The majority of companies on this planet run like ours.
[00:48] They're bootstrapped, they don't have any money.
[00:50] No one's willing to give them a penny.
[00:52] And they open up a shop somewhere.
[00:55] They do something.
[00:56] They put their shingle out and they launch a website or whatever and they try to make it work.
[01:01] So most people are doing it our way.
[01:03] Even though in our industry it seems like we're the outliers, we're not.
[01:06] We're actually incredibly boring and mainstream, really.
[01:10] If you were to pick any random business owner on the street, they'd run their business like us.
[01:14] I've got to make more money than I spend otherwise I'm out.
[01:16] I don't have this big cushion of millions sitting in the bank that I can just spend on things.
[01:20] So they keep an eye on costs.
[01:24] They think about this carefully.
[01:26] But yeah, I'm glad there's people who are going for the moonshot and doing it their way
[01:30] and doing it in a different way.
[01:31] And the world moves forward sometimes because of those businesses.
[01:34] And it's great.
[01:35] It's great.
[01:36] I admire them.
[01:37] It's just that it's not the path I would take.
[01:39] And I think because that's not who I am.
[01:41] And I think this is the important point that I want to get across is I'm not really,
[01:44] hopefully I don't come off as encouraging everyone to be like me.
[01:47] I'm not saying that at all.
[01:49] What I am saying is this is a way to be.
[01:51] It's an alternative to what you're often hearing in our industry,
[01:55] which is like go big or go home, raise a bunch of money and get huge and unicorn
[01:59] status and all thing like that's a way.
[02:01] Just know though that basically almost nobody makes it that way.
[02:06] Like really almost nobody really makes it that way.
[02:11] And there's a lot more room to make it and to build a successful business.
[02:16] If you throw out that outlier and look at all the other places you can land as a business.
[02:22] So my interest is like optionality.
[02:25] If I could land in 135 different positions and have a sustainable business,
[02:31] that's great versus like saying there's only one way I'm going to be successful or happy.
[02:36] Like those odds aren't really in anyone's favor,
[02:39] even though of course some people win the lottery.
[02:41] And I'm not saying it's luck.
[02:43] There's luck, a lot of luck, including we're lucky that we've made it.
[02:47] So there is a degree of that when I say lottery.
[02:49] But really the point is that there's only a few slots for a few companies like that at any one time.
[02:56] Meanwhile, there are hundreds or thousands of slots for other kinds of companies to make it
[03:00] if they don't go for the moon.
