============================================================

[22:10] I hope that let's see how this goes.
[22:13] You're talking about how hiring is changing.
[22:14] I'm curious how PM hiring specifically is changing.
[22:18] A lot of people listening to this podcast
[22:19] or product managers, is there anything unique
[22:21] you're noticing there?
[22:22] Maybe a couple of stats that could be very helpful.
[22:24] If you're having a hard time finding a PM role,
[22:26] let's start with this, you're probably not alone.
[22:28] We publish it, you can go to our economic graph data.
[22:30] This is all public, we publish this.
[22:32] But if you look at tech, it's down about 50%
[22:34] year over year and we look at kind of hires
[22:36] over total population on LinkedIn.
[22:38] You can go to our economic graphs and you can see
[22:40] that how it compares to the trends industry.
[22:42] And we don't look at the functional data as much,
[22:44] but as you can, the PM data seems to be trending
[22:46] just slightly even maybe below software engineers
[22:48] and that as well, which is maybe a cop for this.
[22:50] I know not everything is perfect industry
[22:53] to function kind of cuts.
[22:54] So it is a difficult place, but I'll give you a couple tips
[22:59] because I imagine that may be helpful
[23:00] for a couple of the listeners.
[23:02] And I'm certainly one of the larger inbound
[23:04] of things I get.
[23:05] The first is in those kind of markets,
[23:07] you do wanna make sure that the more you can do
[23:10] to kind of form relationships and kind of say
[23:13] that this is, you know, we can, which is always helpful.
[23:15] Now, I know that not everyone has relationships,
[23:17] but you can always try to develop those
[23:18] at different places in across LinkedIn as well.
[23:21] But that's one thing I would really, really start to look for.
[23:24] The second thing I would really do
[23:25] is we have launched the way now to come in
[23:27] and kind of signal obviously that you're interested in a role.
[23:31] We have those open to work capabilities,
[23:32] but then each of job has a set of skills
[23:35] that they're looking for under it.
[23:36] Like we talked about in skills first hiring.
[23:38] And against each skill,
[23:39] you can actually add different kinds of credentials.
[23:41] And I would really encourage people to add work products
[23:44] if that's something that are actually building,
[23:45] if they add different kinds of recommendations
[23:47] or other things that can associate with that skill.
[23:49] And those credentials against it,
[23:51] I think are becoming much more interesting for people
[23:53] to say, oh, this is someone I'm actually looking for.
[23:55] And then the third thing I would really encourage
[23:57] kind of PMs to start looking through is,
[24:00] I think in every, this is probably more personal
[24:02] than anything in kind of data,
[24:05] but every PM job is different.
[24:06] And if you have experience in that industry
[24:08] and you're able to kind of show
[24:09] that you have experience in industry
[24:10] or some kind of understanding of it,
[24:12] I think that's a way to separate.
[24:13] And so I'd really start zoning in on roles
[24:16] where you might see that kind of the,
[24:18] if you don't know the functional experience,
[24:19] kind of the industry experience.
[24:21] And I think that that would kind of go a long way
[24:23] is how to help you differentiate from, yes,
[24:26] what's probably more candidates
[24:27] or more applications going into each role.
[24:29] And when you say industry experience,
[24:31] what's the example of that?
[24:32] Imagine that you were applying for a PM role,
[24:36] but that particular software is in,
[24:39] I don't know, automotive tech.
[24:40] If you happen to have worked in automotive before,
[24:42] have a knowledge about cars,
[24:44] it's a very helpful way to get in.
[24:46] And I think if you're able to show that,
[24:48] you can show an industry knowledge and understanding of it.
[24:50] I think it's a real nice way to think about
[24:52] how to position yourself against some of the other candidates.
