============================================================

And then following that, it worked out a bunch of really important, well-run, successful companies: Stripe, Twitter, Google, Yahoo. What's one thing you took away from each of these companies that you've worked at that has kind of stuck with you? I know you share a lot of this on Twitter, but if you just think about some things you took away from each of these companies or even the founders that ran these companies, what might those be?

Yeah, let's do this rapid-fire style, because you know me, I could spend an hour just talking about this topic. But just starting with Yahoo, I think I learned the importance of building multiple services under a single account. I think that was the one Yahoo ID was such a powerful thing. It wasn't easy to pull off back in the day, and Yahoo was perhaps the first company that kind of pulled it off really well. So that idea of bundling under a single account, which then Google really did extremely well later on, was something that I got to experience very firsthand, because I was working on the identity team at Yahoo.

Real quick on Yahoo, because it makes me think about, I remember they tried to do that with Flickr, and they had a bunch of trouble with that, right? People on Flickr didn't want to log in with Yahoo. Is that right? Yes, that's the story of every acquisition where there are some raving fans of the service that are perhaps not entirely happy about their beloved service being acquired by a large company. In fact, we encountered this at Google as well. If you remember, YouTube accounts used to be separate from Google accounts or Gmail accounts. At some point, Google decided that you should be able to use your Google account to log into YouTube. Over time, everybody who uses YouTube should have a Google account. So they went through a multi-year migration of accounts at Google, and they had similar backlash. The interesting part, though, is nobody remembers that now. People happily use YouTube. This is one of those things where sometimes it's painful in the short term, even though it might actually be the right answer over the long term.

Great advice. Okay, sorry, I'll cut you off. Google. Yes, Google, I think the main thing I learned was the power of thinking really big. I know it sounds like a platitude, but like really big. I only actually realized that when I left Google and started working with other teams. These were all capable teams, and I was struck by how many teams kind of just limited the potential of what they could achieve. Google helped people sort of think big by default. The six years I spent at Google really helped me understand that well and just make it a normal part of how I operated. So that was really useful for me.

Is there an example at Google that you worked on that was like, holy shit, this is going to be big or let's think bigger about this? Yeah, well, as with anything, right, like there's pluses and minuses. I worked on the ad team at Google for a number of years. There was this unwritten rule of thumb that, hey, if it's not going to generate more than $100 million in revenue, it's not worth talking about. The ads business was growing so fast and was so large that we would regularly not pursue opportunities that were just quote $100 million. Why do that? Google had access to billion-dollar opportunities for its ad business. They were very clear on pursuing the big opportunities. 

In some cases, these opportunities were not obvious, so we had to create those opportunities. If you think about some of the innovations Google brought over the years in monetization, including things like video ads, those were not obvious opportunities, but Google decided that it wanted to pursue those big opportunities. In order to do that, it had to sometimes let go of these seemingly smaller opportunities. That tendency to think about, well, yes, there is a $10 million business here, but can we make it a $100 million business? Or there is a $1 million business here, can we make it a $10 million business? What does it take to make it bigger? That habit got ingrained for me at Google. 

Now, of course, there's the other side of it, which is I think Google missed out on some trends simply because of this filter or this high bar, where sometimes it's not clear if something is a $100 million opportunity or a billion-dollar opportunity. That is a downside of this. What I mainly took away is, for instance, even at Stripe when I joined, I was just thinking a lot bigger about the business I was responsible for, Stripe Connect. That helped us make different decisions about what to prioritize and at what pace to go after it.

Moving on to Twitter, I think at Twitter, the main thing that struck me with all the challenges they had—infrastructure challenges, and also some challenges around leadership and culture—is just the stickiness that comes with combining network effects with core product differentiation. Twitter had both. We talk about network effects all the time, and I don't have much more interesting things to add beyond what's already added. This combination of core product differentiation, because if you think about it, there's still no product like Twitter, right? Despite it now being a long time since the product was launched, that core product differentiation combined with network effects has enabled Twitter to have the staying power it's had. Unless something terrible happens, I think Twitter will be around for a really long time. That's something I got to observe very closely when I worked at Twitter.

At Stripe, I think the main thing I took away was that when you combine high energy, sound judgment, low ego, and small teams, you just get magic. Stripe wasn't by any means flawless, but I saw that combination of high energy, sound judgment, low ego, and small teams more at Stripe than any other place I've been at. That was very impactful in my growth and thinking as a leader.

I can go on with the founders, because I know you had asked that question. So let's do it. Okay, with regards to the founders and what I learned from them, at Yahoo, I didn't work much with the founders. At Google, I had some interactions. I was in meetings with Larry, Sergey, and Eric Schmidt. If I were to pick one thing, I really appreciated Larry's strategic insight and particularly his ability to simulate the future to make better decisions. 

At Twitter, I just overlapped very briefly with Jack's comeback as CEO back when he returned. I was struck by his ability to listen and ask great questions in a few meetings that I was with him. He was really impressive; he would just listen a lot more than you would expect a CEO to listen. Then he would ask one vital question. That's something I've tried to use in my leadership style ever since I saw that.

Is there an example or a story of that happening that you think about? Yeah, I think, you know, I forget the details and they're not that important anyway, but there was a time when we were discussing a potential acquisition. I was on the fence about that acquisition; it would be something that my team would acquire. Jack was in the room, and I remember we went through, as is common in many corporate settings, all the pros and cons and all the intellectual arguments and the strategic arguments and the metrics arguments and all of that. Jack was just listening through all of that. 

Then I remember very distinctly, he asked me one question, which was something to the effect of, how does this make our users love Twitter more? A simple question, but at that point, I realized we never really talked about that. We were so engrossed in all the other stuff, right? We talked about it as a proxy because we were discussing metrics and impact and integration and those sorts of things. I still remember him asking that simple question. At the time, I did not have a good answer to that question. That was a lesson for me to get more rigorous about my own thinking.

That's a question that a lot of PMs would hear and be like, "Oh my God, come on, man, we're trying to move some metrics here." But I love that you took that as something really important. This is a really important question to think about, and as a lesson of how to approach this kind of stuff. 

Oh yeah, I think you were going to talk about Stripe too, right? Yes, at Stripe, I worked a lot with Patrick and John. John was my manager for a while, and from John, I learned a lot about marketing. John is a master marketer, among many other things that he's absolutely great at. He's just a great marketer. I learned a lot about how to think about talking about the product in terms that, you know, again, obvious stuff, but talking about the product in terms that customers really understand. 

Sometimes, he emphasized things that we as product people might not think are really important because maybe we didn't spend much time on building it. We want to talk about things that we spent a lot of time on that are truly innovative, etc. John would often make these observations about, well, if we just talked about the product in this manner, that will likely resonate a lot more with customers. That got me thinking a lot about how I need to reframe my approach to basically separate the effort involved in building something from the effort you want to put behind talking about said thing. That doesn't have to be the same features that you talk about.

From Patrick, I think the main thing I learned was just how to think and communicate more clearly. Patrick did that extremely well. Overall, from both, I learned the importance of setting the culture you want simply by consistently being an example of the behaviors you want to replicate in the organization. Instead of talking about values, I saw both of them just live the values that they wanted the company to replicate, especially as the company was scaling. Whether it's a culture of being user-centric or a value around humility, they just lived those values so consistently. I think that consistency spoke louder than anything that you might write on a poster on the office walls.

Hearing you describe all these companies and all these founders that you've worked with, it's pretty incredible the set of experiences that you've had and kind of like the primordial soup in which you became a PM. It explains a lot about how you're able to squeeze so much wisdom and insights about the role of product management and the art and skill of product management because you've seen so many ways of doing it and so many companies that have done it in different ways.
