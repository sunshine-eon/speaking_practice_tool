============================================================

I've definitely been through that where you set a crazy goal and then we ended up hitting it. I've seen that myself with some of the things you've talked about, like doing it now and not waiting another week to circle back. The stuff you mentioned about taking on the CPO role, not having a CPO, and all these launches sounds like a lot of work and a lot of hours. What have you learned about avoiding burnout and creating balance, and also helping people on your team avoid burnout and create balance?

First of all, I want to give you a very surprising learning. I weirdly find that the more I get involved in the details, the more time I have on my hands. It’s a paradox, and I want to explain that. It doesn’t make any sense, but when I explain this process to people, being in the details and having one shared consciousness, reviewing everything, and doing endless edits—even of the press release—seemed like I would be working 80 to 100 hours a week. It felt like people would be disempowered and that no one would want to do anything. But I got just the opposite.

Here’s what I found: If you decide to be in the details and get very hands-on like I did, it might be a lot more work for about one to two years. Initially, it was way more work than the old way. But once we turned the corner, suddenly everyone started rowing in the same direction. I didn’t have to be in meetings anymore, and people would do what I wanted them to do even if I wasn’t there. That became our culture. They say the culture is what happens when you’re not in the room, and the brand is what people say when you’re not in the room.

As a result, we experienced fewer conflicts in the company and less turnover. People were rolling in the same direction. Before, I would get 10 surprises, and nine were bad. Now, I get 10 surprises, and nine are good. You don’t really have to do anything about good surprises—only the bad ones. I used to have to intervene in projects I wasn’t involved in because they were going off in the wrong direction. By the time I got involved, I was associated with dysfunction, but I only got involved because it wasn’t going well. Fixing something became three times as much work because we weren’t involved in the very early stages.

So, I was much more involved initially, which meant I had a lot less time on my hands. But now, I actually weirdly have a lot more time. Regarding burnout, I think that’s another very good question. I do not think I’m the poster child, at least historically, for work-life balance. I’m 42 years old, I live with a golden retriever, and I don’t yet have a family. If you asked me when I was in college how I thought my life would be right now, I probably would have thought the inverse: that I would have a family and one day run a company. I did things in a slightly different order.

One of the things I’ve learned is that there’s this temptation to work more and more hours. Sometimes, you just have to let an artist step away from the painting; otherwise, you start getting more derivative and slower. I’ve tried to break into practice to step away from the work. Here are some of the things I do: Every other weekend, I don’t really work at all, and then every other weekend, I work pretty intensely. If I had a family, it would probably be more like a day of the weekend where I’d work more intensely, but I’m not in that situation, so it’s a little different.

I usually make sure I exercise and never miss a workout. I wake up and do about 20 minutes of morning cardio and a Peloton, and I go to the gym three or four times a week to do weights. I make sure that I eat really healthy, following a classic bodybuilding diet of five to six meals a day. I also try to get a fairly good amount of sleep. The other two things I focus on are having really healthy relationships. I think one of the most important factors governing how happy you are in life is your relationships. 

I believe the three most important things are your health, your relationships, and your work. As long as you’re healthy and have meaningful work, the last piece is relationships. There was this Harvard study, the longest study on human happiness, which is about 85 years old. The question was, what’s the secret of happiness? They weren’t expecting a single answer, but they got one: the secret to happiness, if there is one, is healthy relationships.

Over time, I found that as an entrepreneur, I had gotten totally isolated. It was almost as if I didn’t have friends. I had friends, but I didn’t keep in touch with them. Every time I reached out to a friend, I had to get them up to speed on my life. If you have to get people up to speed, you’re not really keeping in touch. So, I started making a practice a couple of years ago to ensure I have a group of friends I’m constantly in touch with, including old friends.

I have a group of high school friends, and we have a group chat. We take one to two trips together each year. I also have a group of college friends with a group chat, and we take a couple of trips together each year. By the way, doing Airbnbs is great; we all get in the house together, and it’s an opportunity for shared experiences. If you don’t travel with your old friends, you only have old stories to talk about, and then you end up repeating the same old stories.

When I stay here in New York City, I’m in my sister’s apartment. She has a two-bedroom, and I stay there because I like to see her. I make sure to spend a lot of time with friends, and of course, we travel together. Traveling is something I enjoy doing with many of my friends. I also like to draw and read. So, I try to maintain a balance of health, work, and relationships. You might call family relationships important too. I’m just single, but that would be another version of balance.
