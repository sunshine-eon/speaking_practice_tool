============================================================

Maggie, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Thanks for having me. I'm super excited. You put out so much content across podcasts, blogs, tweets. I'm sure there's other things I haven't even seen. And so what I've done is I've scoured all of your content as much as I could to find topics that we could dig into in our conversation today. I thought it'd be fun to start with how to become a successful product manager and what it takes to be a successful product manager, especially long-term in your career. You've worked through a bunch of PMs. You've hired a lot of PMs. You've managed a lot of PMs. So I guess the question is just, what are some common threads you've seen across the best product managers?

Yeah, it's an interesting question, mostly because I've worked in startups, zero to one, scaling stage startups, enterprise, all that kind of stuff. There's a lot of content out there, I think, on how those roles are different and how PMs are different across those different types of companies. But what I've seen is that there are some standard things that are the same across the role, no matter whether you're a consumer or B2B or startup or a large company. In particular, what sets PMs apart from one another. The things that I look for when I'm hiring or when I'm looking for promotion to promote people, or when PMs stand out even when you're not looking, are three things.

First, I think the best PMs are really good at breaking things down and simplifying things. They can find, at any moment, what is truly the only thing you need to do. Especially in a big company, there are eight million priorities, 700 OKRs, and 25,000 projects you could work on, and teams will get bogged down in that complexity. Similarly, in a startup, you might think it's easy to find the one thing to do, but at the same time, there are so many fires happening and so many things you could do in such a world of opportunity that even just picking one and sticking with it is really difficult. The best PMs not only can find the one thing to work on, but they can stay with that one thing long enough to actually finish it.

I think that's a really interesting point because it sounds simple, this idea of simplifying, but I think there's so much depth there. Partly because within simplifying is prioritizing, and you can almost boil down the job of the PMs to just that—they're prioritizing and telling people what is next. That's a really powerful point you're making. 

Prioritization is a tough word because there's so much wrapped up in that and what it means to prioritize. I've worked for people who wanted to understand the formula for prioritization and why this thing, and how can you prove that this is the right thing to work on and not that thing. Then a week goes by, and they want to reevaluate the priority and relitigate it. So it's so much more than just a moment in time deciding; it's the ability to stay with it and to make sure that it continues to be the most important thing that you finish and actually see that it worked. You have to get people to continue to stay excited and engaged in that project because a lot of when we talk about product is like, "Oh, what should you build? What should you ship?" But then you actually have to ship that, and that can take a week, a month, three months, six months, or even a year. As a PM, your job is to stay on that and be the person who's beating that drum over and over again. The best PMs are the ones who can do that and have the resilience and energy to stay with it.

Energy—that's a really important part of that. I'm going to ask you how you suggest people get better at these things. So either we can go into how you found it, you get better at simplifying, or we can go through all three and then come back, whatever you prefer.

Let's just do all three really quick and then we can dig in.

Sounds great. So yeah, first one—simplifying. I think the second one has to do with this point about sticking with something and it's following up on results. So many people in the spec or the one-pager or something will say, "Okay, here's the metric that I care about. Here's what I want to move." Awesome. Maybe they'll even write a SQL query, get a dashboard going, figure out what the number is today. That gets you some extra points. But the really, really good PMs remember to follow up because especially when you're in management, a couple layers up in management, I'm not going to remember to follow up on that feature. If a PM comes back to me and says, "Hey, remember we did that thing? Here's what happened," I can't tell you how rare that is and how many times as a leader you might have to ask for that. For the people you don't have to ask that of is one of the best things when I'm looking at PMs. It's easy; it's not hard to do that, especially if you've set up metric tracking or you know how to pull that information or you have somebody who can help you get that. It's pretty easy to do and it's a really high-value activity.

And then the third thing, and I think maybe we'll talk about this later too, is a phrase we were talking about, "carrying the water." This was a big theme when I joined Drift. You can't be a good PM if you're not willing to do the hard, boring, unglamorous work of customer support, sales, marketing, writing copy, project management. You have to do that stuff. It's your job; no one else is going to do it. Because at the end of the day, you're responsible for outcomes and results. So you're the person that has to do that, and if you're willing to do that work, that's what's going to make your product successful, which is what makes you successful.
