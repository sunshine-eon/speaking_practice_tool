============================================================

I'm going to summarize the template real quick and then I'm going to have another question kind of along the line. So if you're trying to create your own little template, you start with the mission, the business, and then I imagine you also share the mission of your team because oftentimes it's a little more specific. If you're working on a product team strategy, then there's a landscape of what's happening. 

So you include competitive analysis, like a SWOT analysis of competition, risks, product state, business state, things like that. Then you share the current goals of what you're trying to achieve as a team or business. There's an honest accounting of what's happening in the product and the technical hurdles that might keep you from achieving some of these goals. After that, you share the opportunities you see, how you win, and how you actually achieve this opportunity, where you place bets and things like that, or where you could place bets. 

Then you discuss the challenges of doing this and what needs to be true for it to be possible. Finally, you get to what you think should be done, essentially the solution, ideally in three bullet points. Then comes the plan. I imagine the plan includes steps like getting signed off from execs, resourcing the team, and starting on this design research sprint. Pretty much. 

Amazing. Somebody will create this template if you don't end up doing it. I hope somebody does. That'd be awesome. We'll tweet it, and we will put it in the show notes. So many promises already from this podcast. Along the same lines, you also have a one-pager template and process that I think people find really useful. How about we chat about that one briefly, and then I'm going to go in a whole different direction? 

You're the one-pager. I don't think I have much to say about this that hasn't been said by many people many times, but whether it's a spec, a PRD, or a one-pager, I don't even know what else people call it, it's the document that you use to define the thing that you're doing as a product team. That means product design and engineering, like your little squad. 

What I think is really useful about this process is that it's the PM's artifact. Designers produce designs, engineers write code, but what do PMs do? A lot of people might say nothing. In theory, we write at least this document, right? It can be a pain. I've seen lots of ways where it hasn't been done very well, but when I think it's done really well and is effective, it's a tool that allows the PM to start with why. 

If you structure it correctly, the most important section, in my opinion, is the first part, which is about the background and context. What is the problem? Why does it matter? And why does it matter now? If you get those things right, the rest gets really easy. It gives you a chance as a PM to center the team around the problem, why that problem exists, whether it's created by your own product or something the user is experiencing, and why that problem is worth solving. 

That's a part that I think people sometimes forget to think about—why it's worth solving right now versus all the other problems you could be solving. It can become the home base of the decisions that you make along the way. I think it's best when you have those sections, and it's also best when you write down, okay, on this day, we made this decision, or we decided not to do this, or we decided only to solve this part of the problem, not this part of the problem. Keeping a running list of that and linking off to all the different artifacts and research is helpful for a team. 

So just to summarize, what would be the headings again, just if someone's taking notes on one secret? The little template doesn't have to be very complicated. It's like background and context, the problem. I would literally write why this problem matters and why this problem matters now. Don't make it complicated; just answer those questions. 

And it's only really helpful if you bring that document before you go any further to your team and use it to have a conversation. Get the smart people around you to take shots at it. I should have mentioned this earlier with the strategy. The first person I go to is typically my engineering counterpart, and I say, "Shred this. Go through it, rip it apart, vomit comments on it, tear this down," because that's how it gets better. As a PM, you can't be precious about your work. You need people to poke holes in it. 

The "why this matters now" point is so interesting. I don't often hear that, and I think it's such an important part of specs, plans, and strategies. There are so many things you can do, and there are certain things that are perishable that you can only do now. If you don't do them now, you miss the opportunity. I think that's a really interesting element that most people don't include. 

It reminds me of something I've noticed in enough podcast episodes where I'm connecting all these things as people are talking. It's like a John Nash thing happening where Kari, the founder of Linear, talked about this concept of side quests as a founder. He's so good at staying focused. I asked him how he stays focused and gets stuff done when so many people are coming at him. He said, "There's the main quest and the side quests. The side quests I don't need to do right now. The main quest is to build a really successful business." I feel like this is a good example of that in action. 

Yeah, I love his take on quality and taste too. What a jam. Yeah, big fan of that. But it's really hard to stay disciplined. It's hard to stay focused, and to your point, there are a million things you could do at any given time, especially if you work in a bigger company. The "why now" is an important question to answer because if not, somebody is going to ask you. So you may as well think about it. 

It's interesting how "why now" comes up a lot in investing and startups, but rarely in product building, and it feels like it should. Although I will say in the research I've done, "why now" ends up not being that important for startups being successful or not. So I think there's two sides to that coin.
