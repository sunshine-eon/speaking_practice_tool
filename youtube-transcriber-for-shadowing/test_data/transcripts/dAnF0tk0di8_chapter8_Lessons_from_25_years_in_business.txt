Video: Jason Fried challenges your thinking on fundraising, goals, growth, and more
Time: 22:13 - 27:28
============================================================

[00:00] Speaking of enduring, you've been at this for 25, almost 25 years now, I believe.
[00:05] Yeah.
[00:06] Have there been periods where, like, that sigh that you just had there?
[00:10] It's a long time.
[00:12] So maybe along that path, one, is there a point at which maybe you started going off-track
[00:16] and you realized, this is not what I want to be doing, why did I do this to myself?
[00:19] And then two is just, I don't know, what have you learned being at this for this long?
[00:23] I would say over the past few years, I've had more thoughts of, like, how long should I do this for?
[00:28] And I go back and forth.
[00:30] I can tell you what's interesting is, like, right now, I'm probably more excited than I've been in many years.
[00:35] But a year ago, I was not so excited.
[00:38] And I think that after you've been doing this for a while, you do tend to just sort of compare, like,
[00:44] what was it like in the early days?
[00:45] And what's it like now?
[00:46] And all the new things that are harder weren't harder before.
[00:49] And now they're hard today.
[00:50] And like, do I like doing this kind of hard work?
[00:52] Would I rather do it?
[00:53] You just kind of amass this history.
[00:55] And so you tend to just call back to it and look back to it.
[00:59] And so you kind of opine for the early days or you reminisce, I should say.
[01:03] And you know, so much easier when we were 20 people.
[01:06] Yeah, but we weren't doing this and times were different and you can't go back anyway and whatever.
[01:11] But it's interesting, like, next year, I'll be 50.
[01:14] We'll be 25 years in the business or, you know, we'll be doing this 25 years.
[01:17] I've been running this company for 25 years.
[01:19] Like, part of me thinks, like, is that enough?
[01:21] Like, maybe that's enough.
[01:23] But right now, I'm really excited about what we're doing.
[01:26] We're doing some really great product work.
[01:28] Probably the best we've done in many, many years, launching this new thing called once,
[01:31] which hopefully we're going to build three or so products next year under that category.
[01:36] I would like to write another book.
[01:38] We finally have another idea for another book.
[01:40] So there's just this kind of, right now, this outpouring of energy.
[01:43] I'm trying to be very conscious of, like, my energy interest.
[01:48] Like, right now I'm getting energy from the business.
[01:51] There are times in the past where the business sapped energy from me.
[01:55] And if it saps too much, at some point, you start to think,
[01:57] is it worth it? Do I want to keep doing this?
[01:59] Right now, I'm fueled again by it.
[02:01] But I don't know what it will be like in a year from now.
[02:03] I really don't know.
[02:04] And I think I'm more conscious of that than I've ever been,
[02:07] given how long I've been doing this.
[02:08] And also, like, I always have this strange fantasy.
[02:11] I'm always curious, like, what would someone else do with this place?
[02:14] Like, what if someone else could just step in tomorrow?
[02:16] How would they run it?
[02:17] You know, no one's ever had a chance to run it.
[02:19] But me, like, what would they do differently?
[02:21] I'd have to be completely detached from it
[02:24] to let them really run with it.
[02:26] But what would they do?
[02:27] I always have this sort of curious about that, I would say.
[02:30] And not curious enough to find out.
[02:32] But still curious.
[02:34] It's always in the back of my head.
[02:36] What do you think they do?
[02:37] I think they'd probably be focused on growth.
[02:39] I think there's opportunities that we miss all the time.
[02:41] I think that we are stuck in a certain...
[02:46] It stuck sounds like a negative term,
[02:48] but I don't mean it that way.
[02:49] But we're stuck in a certain groove.
[02:51] Like, we do things the way we do things.
[02:53] We change the way we do things here and there,
[02:56] but we're not really jumping into a new groove.
[02:58] So I think someone would jump into a new groove
[03:00] and run the company differently,
[03:02] maybe make a lot more products than we're making today,
[03:04] maybe resurrect a couple of things that we did in the past,
[03:07] probably spend a lot on advertising, a lot on marketing,
[03:10] probably take our margin way down
[03:12] in order to focus on growth.
[03:13] Like, what if we spent 70% of our margin on growth?
[03:15] Like, what would that look like?
[03:16] I just feel like that's what most people would probably come in
[03:18] with a business like ours and do.
[03:20] They go, oh my God, there's so many missed opportunities here.
[03:22] Look at this and look at this and look at this
[03:24] and get this brand.
[03:25] And if people know about you and you get 100,000 paying customers,
[03:27] like, think about all the things you could do.
[03:29] I'm not really thinking about all the things we could do.
[03:31] I'm thinking about what we're doing.
[03:33] So I think someone else would come in
[03:34] and think about the things we could do.
[03:36] I'm thinking about the things we are doing.
[03:38] And with a little bit of a look ahead
[03:40] to things we could also sort of do,
[03:42] but they're still pretty close to what we're doing today.
[03:44] So that's what I think would happen.
[03:46] And it'd be interesting.
[03:47] It'd be neat to live in a reality where there could be
[03:50] a second reality running right alongside you truly.
[03:53] Not like an A-B test, which is hard to do.
[03:55] You can't really A-B test an entire company.
[03:58] Obviously, I'm seeking A-B test small things.
[04:00] But it'd be kind of cool if that was something that could happen.
[04:02] Maybe there's some simulation down the road.
[04:03] I was just thinking maybe we're in the simulation
[04:05] very into where you're still running it.
[04:07] Could be.
[04:08] And there's another.
[04:09] Let's take a little exercise actually just to think about it.
[04:11] If I were to bring in any that leader, what would they do?
[04:13] And just as a thought exercise.
[04:15] This is a weird way to think about it,
[04:17] but I almost would be sort of embarrassed
[04:19] by what someone would come in and look at and go,
[04:21] my God, you guys are missing so many opportunities here.
[04:24] And I'd be like, yeah, I know, I know we are.
[04:26] But I'm totally fine with it.
[04:28] But there'd be like this moment of judgment
[04:30] and reckoning with like,
[04:32] do you realize how much you're leaving on the table
[04:34] and you could have five different pricing tiers
[04:36] and make a lot more money and you can maximize this
[04:38] and maximize that and squeeze this and squeeze that
[04:40] and address this market.
[04:42] I have special versions of base camp.
[04:43] Well, churches are using base camp.
[04:44] We can do a special version for churches and for,
[04:46] you know, synagogues and religious institutions
[04:48] or education or nonprofits.
[04:50] Like think of all the slight different things
[04:52] you could do with these different,
[04:53] like I'm certain that all those opportunities exist
[04:55] on the table.
[04:56] They don't interest me personally in terms
[04:58] of making multiple products,
[04:59] but I can see someone else going,
[05:00] there's a huge opportunity here.
[05:02] We got to pursue this.
[05:03] And, you know, I'd be really proud if someone
[05:05] did that and like made the business
[05:07] bigger and better.
[05:09] And like, I could never have done that.
[05:11] I'm glad someone else did that.
[05:13] But right now we're running it our way.
