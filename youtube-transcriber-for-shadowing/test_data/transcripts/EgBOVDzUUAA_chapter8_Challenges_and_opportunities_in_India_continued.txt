============================================================

[00:00] I want to zoom out a little bit before we go in a different direction.
[00:03] What do you see as either the most pressing challenges in India right now for tech or
[00:10] the biggest and or the biggest opportunity for Indian startups?
[00:14] And then just generally, where do you think things will evolve in the next few years?
[00:19] Sometimes I wonder the challenges and the opportunities are exactly the same.
[00:23] For example, one of the biggest challenges we have is we have very low female participation
[00:29] of labor compared to many markets.
[00:31] But I also believe it's an opportunity because you can let's say use AI and
[00:34] create many new types of business opportunities because now like work from
[00:38] home is not an alien concept anymore.
[00:40] You can actually create very interesting businesses for that.
[00:43] Number two is we are low on per capita income.
[00:50] So what AI can do instead of taking our jobs away just make us brighter because
[00:55] now like Satya talks about that now expertise is available in the air.
[01:01] So you can actually just kind of ride on that and
[01:03] really make the world very equal in many, many ways.
[01:07] So that's massive opportunity and also the challenge because I often make this
[01:12] joke that the largest employer of the world is inefficiency.
[01:15] And if you take that away too quickly, we'll have a very, very jobless world.
[01:19] So the thing is that it can be an opportunity for
[01:22] a country like India and also potentially a threat because we don't start
[01:26] becoming great at AI.
[01:28] I was actually just telling somebody today that maybe all of our interviews
[01:32] should become about giving a task that they can only perform if they were
[01:37] very good at AI.
[01:39] And no matter what the job is, you make that the minimum criteria that
[01:44] they cannot use that leverage that they'll become a liability in five years
[01:48] anyways.
[01:49] And the last one is we have a very young demographic,
[01:54] very well positioned with access to technology, access to smartphones and so on and so
[02:00] forth and a lot of hunger.
[02:01] But our challenge is also that it's also the first generation that is truly
[02:05] learning what is entrepreneurship, what is risk and will make all sorts of
[02:09] mistakes get there.
[02:10] And I hope we don't go into shell after having these large scale
[02:15] failures that you have not seen before.
[02:17] India is not used to layoffs like Shut Up World is used to layoffs.
[02:22] But in India, if you started to layoffs, it becomes the national news and all sorts
[02:27] of discussions happen over here.
[02:28] So we are not there yet.
[02:30] So we are stuck between like being somewhat of a collectivist or some of
[02:36] our individualistic societies.
[02:37] We are somewhere, India is a great remix of everything.
[02:42] I love this line you just shared of inefficiencies is the largest
[02:46] employer in the world.
[02:49] I totally get that.
