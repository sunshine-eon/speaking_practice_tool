============================================================

[00:00] You've been talking about simplicity, the opposite extreme is you could say entropy.
[00:05] And someone told me that you have this kind of concept that every leader in every business
[00:10] is fighting the second law of thermodynamics, which I believe is entropy.
[00:15] Yeah.
[00:16] Well, yeah.
[00:17] The actual law is within a closed system, entropy increases over time.
[00:21] Okay.
[00:22] And yeah.
[00:23] We don't have to get into the...
[00:24] No, I love physics.
[00:25] No, we're getting into the real, the first principles of everything.
[00:29] Talk about that.
[00:30] What does that mean when you...
[00:31] And what does that look like when you're running a business?
[00:33] Okay.
[00:34] So in lay person's terms, the second law of thermodynamics, I'm paraphrasing here, is that
[00:38] over time, unless you intervene, everything goes to crap.
[00:43] I'm paraphrasing, right?
[00:44] Which is essentially the amount of disorder and randomness in a system is going to increase
[00:48] over time.
[00:49] You see this.
[00:50] Like when you break an egg, the break of it, like molecules don't come together
[00:52] and form an egg, right?
[00:53] That doesn't happen.
[00:54] It's always the other way around.
[00:55] It becomes disorderly and more random.
[00:57] That's the second law of thermodynamics.
[00:59] And this happens in companies as well, right?
[01:02] Like, and it happens in code, like almost every level of abstraction, you will see some variation
[01:07] of this.
[01:08] And so the way I think about this is that in the early stages of a company, you're
[01:11] essentially fighting to survive, like just trying not to die, right?
[01:16] That's the thing.
[01:17] Like, okay, like Friday, one, don't die.
[01:19] In the second phase of a company, you're trying not to stagnate, right?
[01:23] Like you still want to be able to drive growth and be able to do things like,
[01:26] we managed not to die because stagnation is essentially death.
[01:30] So we're still trying not to die.
[01:32] But then the third stage is your fighting complexity.
[01:36] And that's the thing that you will crumble under your own weight over time, absent some
[01:41] external intervention.
[01:43] And this, you see this happen all the time, right?
[01:45] And it shows up and manifests in different ways, which is everything gets more complicated.
[01:49] Like you need more layers of management, more headcount, more this, more that, more
[01:53] everything, everything that becomes harder margins.
[01:55] Like just bad things start to happen, you become slower.
[01:59] And that's eventually, it's a slower death, right?
[02:00] Because you're at more scale now.
[02:02] But it's still eventual death, right?
[02:05] Like complexity does kill companies, maybe not as quickly as other things, but much more
[02:10] reliably than other things.
[02:12] And so this is why it's never too early to kind of plant the seeds of simplicity,
[02:19] put them in there to make that part of the kind of culture of the organization.
[02:23] And we have a thing that are part of our kind of culture and dining principles around what
[02:27] I call fight for simplicity.
[02:29] It's literally those three words, right?
[02:31] And the message we're trying to convey is simplicity is worth fighting for.
[02:34] That's like thing number one, it's important.
[02:36] But the other one is that it requires fighting force.
[02:39] It does not happen.
[02:40] And it will be a fight because the universe is working against you.
[02:44] And it will take calories to fight to that simplicity because everything, even
[02:48] well-intentioned people will introduce complexity because that's the natural way of the world.
[02:53] We want more tears in our pricing.
[02:54] We want these knobs and dials in the product.
[02:56] We want these more, you know, it's like all of it tends towards the second law and
[03:00] entropy increases.
[03:01] So anyway, I love this.
