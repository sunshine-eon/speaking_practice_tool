============================================================

[00:00] When you're trying to decide which side of the marketplace to focus on and prioritize,
[00:04] do you have any kind of lessons or rules of thumb of just like focus on
[00:08] the customer and index towards their happiness versus the supply versus say the delivery person?
[00:13] There's one thing that I think marketplaces need to realize is that A, you need to be operating
[00:18] in a stable marketplace. So all sides need to be stable enough so that they're not going to go away.
[00:24] So I think that's the starting point. And that's an important point.
[00:27] Because once you have established that, then after stable marketplace, then we say that which are the
[00:32] which is the kind of customer that we're in the service of, which are the customers that we will really focus on.
[00:37] For example, Amazon is very, very clearly a customer-centric company.
[00:41] And if they have to make a choice, they won't because they need to have a stable marketplace.
[00:46] So sellers also are very as important, but slightly more important than the customer.
[00:51] For example, if you look at, say, Taobao in Alibaba, their way of thinking is that
[00:58] aiming life is to create life-changing experience for 10 million Chinese sellers.
[01:03] And they will create a marketplace from the point of view of sellers which can actually sell.
[01:08] Again, they will have the same consumer app and a seller work and so on.
[01:13] They are in the service of sellers. So you really need to derive from the company's vision.
[01:19] I think the way we had thought about it, that we had to clarify in our values that the first value is
[01:25] initially it used to be customer comes first. But that was very confusing because everybody is a customer.
[01:30] The restaurant is a selling customer and so on.
[01:34] We had to clarify the consumer comes first, the end consumer, which is actually eating food
[01:39] because we're a convenience company that delivers to the end consumer.
[01:44] And when you're thinking about restaurants or delivery partners,
[01:48] and we work with them because we both are, when you're talking with the delivery partner,
[01:53] Swiggy and the delivery partner, we both are in the service of the customer.
[01:56] So you will build that app also from that perspective and even the restaurant side also from that perspective.
[02:02] We both are together in the service of the end customer.
[02:05] I feel like you have probably 100 more frameworks and processes and acronyms we can talk about.
[02:10] But I know you got to go. Is there anything else you wanted to touch on
[02:14] or is there anything else you want to leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?
[02:19] Just last few words that want to revise.
[02:22] Work backwards from an amazing future.
[02:24] So the first thing is creatively imagine a future and then work backwards from that
[02:29] and essentially think what will make that successful and be paranoid about that
[02:34] everything is going to go wrong and hence I need to just make sure that it all comes together.
[02:39] Only the paranoid survive great advice to leave people with.
[02:43] We reached a very exciting lightning round.
[02:45] I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?
[02:47] Yeah.
[02:49] What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?
[02:53] One book is working backwards. We covered that.
[02:55] The other one that has shaped my beliefs a lot is called How Brands Grow.
[03:00] It's by a professor called Byron Sharp.
[03:02] The two parts to it, How Brands Grow one and two.
[03:05] That's both very good.
[03:07] The other book which I really love is and recently Kunal Shah,
[03:11] who's the founder of Cred and Indian Startup, he suggested is the Luxury Strategy.
[03:15] And the reason why I love that book is because it gets into the depth of the human psychology behind
[03:22] hierarchies and how lords and kings and those kind of social hierarchies have shaped
[03:28] how people think about aspirational products and so on.
[03:31] So highly recommend it.
[03:33] What's a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?
[03:37] I really like to do reruns of The Office.
[03:41] So I was trying to think about this.
[03:44] What is the recent movie that I was like, no, I keep on going back to The Office
[03:48] and some other episode and try to do a lot of stories from Michael Scott.
[03:53] And the US one, not the British one, or do you watch both?
[03:57] No, I watch both, but the US one has a lot more seasons.
[04:01] Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates
[04:04] when you're interviewing product manager specifically?
[04:07] Which are the products where you decide speed is more important
[04:10] versus which are the products where you decide excellence is more important?
[04:14] And I think that gives me a good understanding of their frameworks
[04:18] and why they're deciding what.
[04:20] And then we go back into concrete examples where they chose one versus the other.
[04:24] And then take it from there.
[04:26] And then what do you look for in a good answer to that question?
[04:30] I look for essentially their assessment of risk,
[04:34] their assessment of how important or how well have they assessed the market
[04:40] and the competition or the competitive products in that market.
[04:44] And if their answer is let's ship something and we'll find out and so on.
[04:48] That also gives me basically a point of view that they really don't understand
[04:52] that this product what they're talking about with this ship with speed
[04:57] is not read the the V part of the MVP is not viable or it's not
[05:02] or I don't know how do you call the MLP or like whatever,
[05:05] but it's not differentiated enough that it can be marketed.
[05:09] It is not worth enough where we can take it to user.
[05:12] It's not going to work for a lazy man and selfish user.
[05:15] And maybe that's not the answer towards speed versus excellence.
[05:20] Versus for example, there's some products,
[05:22] there's a very clear competitive differentiation that we can find.
[05:26] There's a clear market gap.
[05:27] I wanted to learn something even if it is hard.
