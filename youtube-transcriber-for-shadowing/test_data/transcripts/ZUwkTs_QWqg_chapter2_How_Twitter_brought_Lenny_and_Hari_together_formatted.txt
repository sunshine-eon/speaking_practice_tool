"Bloodline"

Hari, welcome to the podcast. Thanks for having me. I've been a big fan for a long time.

I really appreciate that. What a fun story behind this conversation. Let me just ask you, how did you feel when I called DMD on LinkedIn and asked you to be on this podcast because of a random tweet?

I felt very honored. Again, I really have followed your work for a while. It's been really amazing to see what you've built, and I'm a huge fan of different builders. It was a little bit of an honor that someone reached out to me. I know we're gonna get into the story in a little bit, but when you work on something, oftentimes like jobs and learning, it's rare that it comes up in the influencer conversation. It's not necessarily something you or other people are probably experiencing on a day-to-day basis. So sometimes I don't know if we get to tell some of these stories, and I really appreciate you reaching out for that.

Yeah, absolutely. So I guess let me just give a big thank you to Jatin Rajvanshi, also known as the Curious PM, who tweeted about this concept and then was like, "Hey, talk to Hari about LinkedIn." So thank you, Jatin, for making this happen. It was all thanks to you.

Usually when this happens, someone tweets a recommendation of someone, they know each other, and I'm like, I don't know, this is kind of some promotion of some other person. But you guys don't know each other, right?

I don't. I'm looking forward to meeting you, and thank you again for putting in the word.

Absolutely, and also thank you to Jatin for recommending a bunch of questions that I'm gonna ask you. I didn't know, so maybe I shouldn't have. But thanks again, Jatin. It's very kind of you.
