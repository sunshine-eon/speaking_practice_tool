============================================================

[00:00] in the world. What's what's next for lovable? What's kind of like the next few things they might
[00:04] launch as this episode comes out? As I mentioned this, agentic behavior. And when I say agentic,
[00:11] what it means is that you give more freedom to the system to decide what happens next.
[00:17] It might want to write a test, run those tests, and say like, oh, the test failed,
[00:21] like let's fix those. So that's one of the big unlocks for getting further faster.
[00:28] And then there's some more like obvious things that you want to do to go all the way to
[00:38] easily go all the way to making money with lovable. And that's like how do you set up
[00:44] so that it's hosted on your specific domain? How do you collaborate seamlessly with your team?
[00:51] I'm making that that is here so that are just obvious things. And something we're thinking about
[00:59] is to help just founders succeed after they built their first version. And like,
[01:04] how do they get more users? How do they get feedback? How do they get the word out if
[01:08] they build something useful? I was just going to say that that's that's exactly where my
[01:14] mind went is like, everyone's going to be building all these things, no one's ever going to
[01:17] get any traction with these tools because no one knows how to find users get anyone to
[01:22] basically go to market and growth is like a whole different skill.
[01:26] So that is so cool that you're thinking about that. How do we run some paid ads for you?
[01:30] How do we think about SEO? How do we think about word of mouth,
[01:33] morality referrals? That is very cool. Okay.
[01:36] If we already have some free books that we that we help the people building with,
[01:40] how do you do those things that you can find up on a blog?
[01:44] Interestingly, this makes me want to buy some Metastock because all these apps that everyone's
[01:48] building, they're going to be running paid ads on Facebook and Google. Oh my God, what a good
[01:52] business those other guys get. I want to come back to, you said that you can work on your
[01:58] existing code base. This is actually a big question for a lot of people. They see all these
[02:01] tools. They're all like amazing for prototypes and concepting. You talked about how you can
[02:06] actually do this within your existing code base, use lovable.
[02:10] Let me correct you there. You cannot use it on any existing code base. We kind of have a
[02:17] research free of importing your code base. But what you can do is if you start in lovable,
[02:23] then you can have engineers editing it in whatever tool they want to use for editing it.
[02:28] Okay, cool. That's great clarification. So I guess just for people because a lot of,
[02:32] like most listeners here are not building something brand new. They're working within
[02:35] an existing product. So you're saying that that is coming. You can use lovable in the future
[02:41] in some form with your existing app and product. Great. Wow. That's huge. Okay. Because that's
[02:48] basically the most people. So that's going to be a big deal. Okay.
