============================================================

[00:00] There's a very famous story about Canva.
[00:01] Early on, you pitched over 100 investors,
[00:04] and over 100 investors said no to you.
[00:06] It was really clear in my mind that it was the future,
[00:08] and I thought the investors were wrong, frankly.
[00:11] But investors also gave really helpful feedback,
[00:14] and feedback often in the form of rejection.
[00:16] They would say, oh, your market's not big enough,
[00:18] and I would say it's going to be huge.
[00:20] And I'd add a new page in my pitch deck
[00:22] that said how big the market, I believe, was.
[00:24] And then they'd say, you're the same as some other company.
[00:26] And I would say, hey, now I've got a new slide in my pitch deck
[00:28] that shows all the players and the huge gap in the market
[00:31] that we believe we're going to fill.
[00:33] 20 of your values.
[00:33] Crazy big goals.
[00:34] I love that as a value.
[00:35] The thing that I love about a crazy big goal
[00:37] is that you feel completely inadequate before it.
[00:39] You want to work really hard to will it into existence.
[00:42] I really like to start by just imagining
[00:44] what is the future that you actually want.
[00:46] Right now, I have a wall in my house in my office,
[00:49] which is my vision for what I'd like the world to look like in 2050.
[00:52] I heard from one of your human members, Melissa Tan,
[00:54] that there's a deck like this.
[00:56] For every project you kick off, there's this big vision deck.
[00:59] And so we have this concept of chaos to clarity.
[01:01] Every idea starts in the chaos side,
[01:03] and then you have to work all the way to the other side,
[01:05] which is clarity.
[01:06] That very first step at the far end of chaos
[01:09] was quite a embarrassing step, actually,
[01:11] because you don't have mastery at that point.
[01:13] You don't have all the answers.
[01:14] A lot of people think of Canada as like a design graphics
[01:17] for social media and marketing and things like that.
[01:19] But you also have spreadsheets, docs, whiteboards, charts,
[01:22] AI coding tool.
[01:24] It was funny looking back from really old decks.
[01:26] We were trying to do AI, but AI was actually a thing.
[01:30] Today, my guest is Melanie Perkins,
[01:33] CEO and co-founder of Canva.
[01:35] Melanie is on track to be the most successful
[01:37] female tech founder in history
[01:40] and one of the most successful founders, period.
[01:43] Canva has currently valued at over $42 billion,
[01:46] making over $3.3 billion in revenue a year.
[01:49] They've been profitable for eight years straight
[01:51] and are one of the hottest private tech companies
[01:53] in the world right now.
[01:54] But it wasn't always this way.
[01:56] Melanie was rejected by over 100 investors
[01:59] when she was trying to raise her first round.
[02:00] Their team spent two years rewriting their entire code base
[02:03] and were unable to ship any new features for over two years,
[02:07] something they expected to just take six months.
[02:09] And they even went through a big pivot early on
[02:11] from a yearbook publishing platform
[02:13] to the Canva that you know today.
[02:15] Melanie does not do a lot of podcasts.
[02:17] She shares stories that I've never heard before
[02:19] and lessons that I'm still thinking about.
[02:21] This is a really rare opportunity
[02:23] to learn from a legendary founder.

[03:50] Last year, 1.3% of global GDP flow through Stripe.
[03:55] That's over $1.4 trillion.
[03:58] Stripe helps ambitious founders start companies
[04:00] and scale them from pre-seed to IPO and beyond.
[04:04] Used by 78% of the Forbes AI50,
[04:07] Stripe provides financial infrastructure
[04:09] for payments, billing and software
[04:11] to platforms and marketplaces
[04:13] so they can monetize faster,
[04:15] experiment with pricing and grow revenue.
[04:17] With Stripe, businesses achieve
[04:19] massive global scale faster than they would otherwise
[04:22] and at the beginning of that journey
[04:23] is where Stripe startups comes in.

[04:27] to support early stage venture-backed businesses
