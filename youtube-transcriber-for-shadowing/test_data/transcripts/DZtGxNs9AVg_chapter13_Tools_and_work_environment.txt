[00:00] different. Okay. And then what are the tools used just for folks that want to understand like the
[00:03] latest tools? So you said fig jam, what else is in that stack of tools? I mean, we do so many things
[00:10] in our company in linear, because it's just an amazing product. So we do talent application tracking
[00:17] in linear. And after going through and dissing a lot of the other custom made tools for that,
[00:25] linear and then fig jam. So simple. How soon until one of your engineers is an agent engineer,
[00:34] an AI engineer, do you think? Do you have a sense? I love to dig into what does that question actually
[00:40] mean. I think we've been talking about like, oh, AI, that would require more something playing
[00:48] chess. That's that's AI. Like, if you give an AI if a computer can play chess, that's AI. And
[00:52] now that's like, oh, no, that's a chess program. And we always shifting this forward and forward.
[01:00] I think anything that a human doesn't do is just a smart computer system, right? So what is
[01:14] when is some when isn't a software engineer and agent? I think it's always going to be just
[01:21] we're building in level was just an interface that humans interact with to create the software
[01:27] that they want. And then how we solve that if we set going to be an agent under some definition.
[01:33] Yeah, sure, I think so. But that's less important to me. Okay, I like that.
