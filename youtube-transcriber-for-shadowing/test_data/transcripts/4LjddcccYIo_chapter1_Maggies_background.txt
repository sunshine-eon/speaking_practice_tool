Time: 00:00 - 04:06
============================================================

[00:00] If you ever find yourself saying something like,
[00:03] that's not my job, that's probably a thing you should do.
[00:06] And it probably isn't your job
[00:08] and it probably is someone else's job
[00:10] and you can spend your life getting frustrated at that
[00:12] or you can just get over and get the work done.
[00:14] And people who are willing to just get the work done
[00:16] will move faster, their products will be more successful
[00:19] and they probably aren't carrying around all that anger
[00:24] and crappy emotion because it has a PM
[00:28] for better or for worse.
[00:29] And maybe this is not how we all want it to be
[00:31] but you're oftentimes the emotional center of the team
[00:34] and it's your job to keep people motivated,
[00:37] keep people excited, keep them bought into the project
[00:40] and you just have to like keep that optimism going
[00:43] and it's hard work and part of it can be just like,
[00:46] you know what, let me take that on.
[00:47] I'll do this thing.
[00:49] I'll hop on the sales call.
[00:50] I'll implement this with the customer.
[00:52] You just have to do whatever it takes.
[00:55] Today, my guest is Maggie Crowley.
[00:57] Maggie is currently vice president of product at Toast.
[01:00] Prior to this, she was VP and head of product at Charlie Health,
[01:03] senior director of product at Drift,
[01:05] director of product at Bev Spot,
[01:07] product manager at TripAdvisor.
[01:09] She's also got an MBA from Harvard Business School.
[01:11] She was also an Olympic speed skater,
[01:13] which is insane and incredibly cool.
[01:16] And in our conversation, we discuss the three
[01:18] most common threads across the best product managers
[01:20] that she's worked with, hired and managed
[01:22] had a very tactically write out a product strategy
[01:25] to share with your team and manager.
[01:27] Why being data driven is a red flag for product thinking.
[01:30] Why product content you find online can be dangerous.
[01:34] Her best advice for how to break into product management.
[01:36] Also, the impact of writing online has had on her career
[01:39] and so much more, Maggie is amazing.
[01:41] I'm excited for you to learn from her like I did.
[01:44] With that, I bring you Maggie Crowley
[01:46] after a short word from our sponsors.
