============================================================

I heard you say along the same lines on a different podcast about how when you were really busy, you didn't have time to reach out to anyone. They never thought they could reach out to you because they thought you were so busy. In the old world, I was reacting. So everyone thought I was busy. The people I really cared about, a lot of them said, "Well, he's busy. So who reached out to me when he's not busy?" 

But here's the problem. I was so busy that all I was doing all day was responding to people. If the people I cared about didn't reach out to me, I was just dealing with incoming. I could barely deal with the incoming. Now, that was a mistake, but I was reacting. By the way, here's another lesson for founders: a lot of founders spend their time based on reacting. People will email them, and they'll wake up and reply to emails. Suddenly, their email sets the agenda. 

People ask for meetings, and suddenly the meetings they take are based on the people who email them, versus thinking about their strategy. Over the next year, what are the relationships I need to have and the meetings I need to take to actually execute my strategy? If my life were to end in a year or in ten years, or some time horizon that's shorter than I expected, who are the people I would have wanted to make sure I spent time with? 

If you imagine that your life is finite, because it is, and you consider that you might not be here as long as you thought you would be, it could completely change how you prioritize your time. I think suddenly you would start to say no to things and say yes to other things. I now try to say no to what I call fake work, which are things that feel like work but don’t actually move the ball down the field. I really try to say yes to work that's very meaningful and to people that are very meaningful to me. 

So yeah, it's a really, really good insight. And by the way, that metaphor, Lenny, is true of companies too. You don't want to only spend your time reacting or spending your time with the employees reaching out to you. I mean, you do want to do some of it, but then you're rewarding only one type of behavior. The introverts or the people that aren't reaching out to you aren't going to get any attention. 

Just one more question, and then I have a quick fun question at the end. I know you have to run.
