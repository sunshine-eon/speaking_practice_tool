============================================================

[00:00] Anyway, I'm going to move on to a different topic, and this might become a new thing that
[00:05] we do, and I'm going to call it Contrarian Corner.
[00:08] I asked you if you have Contrarian opinions about things before we started recording this
[00:13] episode, and you had some really good ones.
[00:15] So there's a couple topics I'm going to chat about, and we'll see if this becomes
[00:19] a recurring theme, and you're laughing and nodding your head, what are you thinking
[00:22] as I say this?
[00:23] I'm thinking about when I had a podcast, you would do a show on a topic, and
[00:28] you would click the end recording button, and then every single guest would be like,
[00:33] I had no idea what I was doing.
[00:34] I made it all up.
[00:35] It was waterfall.
[00:36] It was just like that, none of that matters.
[00:38] Like I didn't know what I, like it was just, people would say the wildest stuff,
[00:41] and I would sit there as a PM and just think like, what?
[00:45] Like we just talked about this, this framework, we just talked about this
[00:47] thing, and like that's how you're supposed to do it.
[00:49] And then they would get off the, get off the official part and just say,
[00:52] yeah, it's wild.
[00:53] Like nothing goes the way you want it to go.
[00:55] Like we're all just kind of making it up as we go.
[00:57] And so I, I hope that you get more of those takes in this part of the, part of the show.
[01:02] I'm very sensitive to that point right now, because someone just tweeted about
[01:05] how they're just finding that many of my newsletter posts about how companies
[01:10] write product are like the ideal version of what they do.
[01:14] And I rarely, or they rarely share, here's all the challenges we're having,
[01:18] which I think there's truth to that.
[01:20] But I also get into a lot of failures on this podcast.
[01:22] Actually, I think the podcast is a lot more of just like, here's
[01:24] things that go wrong versus these letter.
[01:26] So I'm just like, shit, I need to do more.
