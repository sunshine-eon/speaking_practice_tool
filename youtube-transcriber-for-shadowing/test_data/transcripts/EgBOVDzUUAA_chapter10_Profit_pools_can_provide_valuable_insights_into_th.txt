============================================================

[00:00] things I've learned is that profit pools of a country tell you a lot about what the country
[00:06] values and trying to copy somebody else's profit pool to your country will not be a wise idea
[00:13] because the country's values are demonstrated in what profit pools exist. Let's take an example.
[00:19] In the thousand most profitable companies in India, the number of retailers would be probably two
[00:24] or three. But if you look at the western market, you'll see a bunch of them because it's a consumption
[00:31] market plus very high divorce rate means you're always peacocking again in the market again.
[00:36] You're trying to be fit and be cool and all of that. India has very low divorce rate,
[00:40] less than 1% arranged marriages and fashion spend. And because we have a lower female
[00:47] participation of labor, India is probably the only market where female fashion spends
[00:51] is less than men's fashion spends. Everywhere else, it's probably 5, 6x more for women.
[00:56] So what happens is you start appreciating what the country values. For example, I have noticed that
[01:02] many patriarchal societies have very significant market cap in financial services versus consumption.
[01:10] And these broad patterns you start thinking about very, very differently.
