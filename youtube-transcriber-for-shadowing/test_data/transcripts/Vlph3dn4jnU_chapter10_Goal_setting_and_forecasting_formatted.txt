Okay. So with these teams, is there anything you can share about just like how you think about metrics and goals for these different buckets? We don't need to go too deeply, but does everyone basically have like an absolute new merchants goal? Or is it a little different?

So yeah, at the highest level, we think about that total cohort value. We bring in a set of merchants in a given year. How much GMV, how much is that set of merchants worth over the next three to four years to Shopify? That's the most important thing that we want to focus on. Of course, from an efficiency standpoint, we need to meet our payback guardrails and all that. So that's kind of the macro growth perspective: cohort value over cost and payback.

Within growth marketing, each channel operates with certain guardrails around their LTVD CACs. The same goes for content SEO, which operates with a guardrail model for each piece of content. We look at how much that content is going to contribute down the line. For growth products, it's also a combination of total GP and incremental cohort value produced by those teams. Everything is ideally measured over a long time period to assess the incremental core value lift generated.

That's how we think about it—measuring the impact of each of those sub-teams along the way. Each of those teams has a specific part to play, but because they are measured on absolutes, we don't get caught up in whether the conversion rate went up or down over the course of the year. It's kind of irrelevant. What matters is the sum of the impact over a long period on the total core value we’re trying to produce for merchants.

The way you come up with this goal, I imagine, is you have a forecast of where things would go organically. Then you set a target for the lift you want to see from the work this team does this quarter or this year. Correct? 

Yes, and then we measure for each experiment whether it actually achieved the expected lift. Those experiments can vary in duration; some are long-term holds where we look at the results after a year, while others we evaluate after three weeks. In all cases, we still monitor the groups. Every experiment is watched, and we revisit the results after three, six, or twelve months to determine if it was actually successful.

Okay, cool. So that creates the loop of shipping value quickly while ensuring we hold ourselves accountable to whether this actually produced results over a long period or just had a neutral effect. If it didn't work, we can learn from that and improve.
