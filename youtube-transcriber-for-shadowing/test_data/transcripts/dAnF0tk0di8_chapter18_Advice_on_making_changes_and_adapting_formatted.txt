============================================================

Okay, so we had some questions come in from the audience when we were preparing for this. We both tweeted to see what people wanted to ask. I have two that I picked out. One is from Matt Mullenweg. How cool is that? Oh my God. And I think you may have seen this question, but the question is, what is the spectacular failure of someone trying to follow your advice and failing when it doesn't stick? 

What is the reason? People trying to make rapid, fundamentally like 180-degree changes quickly is a grave way to fall flat on your face, basically. So I have seen people who try to adopt, let's say, shape up, and they come back six weeks later and say, "This sucks. This doesn't work." I'm like, I'm not surprised to hear that. I ask them how they did it, and they explain, "Oh, the next project we did, we did this." I'm like, yeah, I'm really not surprised to hear that now because you just can't really do that. You can't turn on a dime. 

There's this thing called momentum. I always try to think of things in terms of the physical world; the more massive an object, the more energy it takes to change its direction. This is why big companies move slowly. Momentum, which is like the way you've been working for four years, is going to power you forward in a certain way. It's very hard to turn the corner immediately or turn around. You just cannot do it physically. If you can't do it physically, you can't do it this way. 

So I think that's what I've seen: these rapid changes, like, "Alright, starting tomorrow or starting shape up." It's like, well, no. It's not going to work unless you say we're going to do it on this other thing that doesn't matter so much. 

The other thing is that pretty much every business is a spectacular failure. Business is really hard, and the ones that make it are all outliers. This is why most businesses fail. There are a million reasons why, and it's always hard to pin it down. We can all look back, but this is why, by the way, I don't like to look back on things. I'm not much of a fan of looking back on failures and trying to figure out what went wrong so we don't do it again because I don't think we know what went wrong. 

I think we can spend a long time trying to analyze it, and we're going to find something that we can agree on. It tends to be what you can agree on so you can move on, but that doesn't mean that's what it was. Just like we don't really know why you make decisions, you don't really know why things didn't work. Sometimes there are examples, and I think it's true if you're talking about a mechanistic system, like stamping metal where it's supposed to have perfect circles and it's an oval. You can go back to that machine and see how it worked and the line. You can adjust that and fix that. 

A lot of work, though, is not that way, especially software work. There are a million different inputs and a million different people. It's not simple stamping machines; it's a different thing. So I don't know, but I do think that trying to make big changes too quickly is a primary reason. 

You've seen this approach work at traditional companies. I imagine it's not just companies that work in your way where there are no investors and they're not obsessed with growth. You've seen shape up implemented at traditional public-type companies. It's usually smaller teams, so it's not like Airbnb. Brian's not going to say, "Okay, tomorrow we're following this thing that these guys over at 37 Signals came up with." 

Typically, it's small teams inside larger companies that experiment with this, and sometimes it spreads and sometimes it doesn't. It doesn't always need to. It could be this one division, this one group that works a different way. Also, it doesn't have to be fully shape up. It could be 30% of it. Maybe it's just simply the six-week cycle thing that really is the thing, and the rest of it doesn't matter so much. Or it could be this idea of appetites versus estimates, and they can work that into the way they work. You know, take whatever works; you don't have to go wholesale.
