and strategy, financial plan, roadmap. I think where we landed on with OKRs were really around more cross-functional things in nature. So for example, we'll have an OKR around winning a specific market. And we'll have OKRs that are cross-functional across different teams. But again, an OKR is just a method to measure an objective with metrics. You can use them at various levels of granularity. 

I stay away from them from a product perspective because, again, I want to focus on velocity, which is just output, which is your roadmap. They're pretty strong at more of the cross-functional side of things as well as the financial side of things. I don't even know what separates an OKR from not an OKR. I feel like OKRs are just a goal with some high-level statements of things we're trying to accomplish. 

I don't even understand when people say they use OKRs or don't; what that even means anymore. There's a recurring point on this podcast and other posts of just people are weary of being obsessed with here's the metric that we're going to hit and that's all that matters. There's a fear they lose sight of the bigger picture of what they're trying to accomplish. But I think in the end, it's just like, here's what we're trying to do, here's some goals we're going to hit. Like, is that an OKR? I don't know. I think that's right. 

At the end of the day, the contract is your product roadmap. That's the contract you have to the sales organization. Marketing can take that product roadmap and create market moments. Ultimately, if your product roadmap doesn't actually hit the goals of the company, then I'm accountable. I've created a system by which I've aligned with each team on why the roadmap is going to hit the goals. 

You essentially need to point back to the leader in that regard. But I can't ask every team to try to manipulate OKRs to fit their roadmaps. That's just completely exhausting. We've aligned on what we need to do; let's get it done. Something that comes across pretty clearly in the way you think and the way Ramp operates is this idea of thinking from first principles. It's kind of a cliché term. It feels like everyone's always trying to talk about how they're thinking from first principles, and it's important to their.
