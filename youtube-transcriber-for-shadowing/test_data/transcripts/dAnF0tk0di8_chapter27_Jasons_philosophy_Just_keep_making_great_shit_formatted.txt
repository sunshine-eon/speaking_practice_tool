I'm the same way with the newsletter and the podcast. There's no way I can grow this thing with money, really. I've tried a bunch of little experiments, and nothing really does anything. It actually comes back to you. Let me find this quote they have of just like your business strategy in a nutshell: just keep making great shit. Keep your costs in check, charge appropriate prices for your work, and share as much as you can. I'll let the chips fall where they may. 

That's basically it. I mean, one of the things I don't think I said there was to enjoy it, have fun, enjoy the ride, you know? Love who you're working with and create a great environment to do great work so that other people can thrive as well. That's all baked into that. It's not about set targets, it's not about trying to be a billion-dollar business, and it's not about aiming for an exit or being on the cover of whatever. 

It's not many of those things. Maybe it's the Midwestern-ness in me, you know, growing up in Chicago. I don't know. It's just that my dad gave me the best business advice I've ever received. It's just a simple line: no one ever went broke making a profit. Maybe that's just my guiding light ultimately. You can go broke generating a lot of revenue; a lot of companies do. But you can't go broke generating a profit, and I think it's just really tight. What a great quote.
