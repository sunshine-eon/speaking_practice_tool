I'm going to keep us on the AI thread and take us to AI Corner, which is a recurring segment on this podcast. So here's the question: what's the way you found in your personal life and work life to use AI where it ends up being really helpful, something really interesting that people might find useful?

So many things. AI is often the first place I go when I have an idea and want to explore it further. Now with Canva, I can just tag it and say, "Give me more ideas on this." It's shockingly great because it has all of the context from the design and is integrated deeply into my workflow.

Another really fun thing I do is an AI walk. I put my ear pods in, go for a walk, and just say everything on my mind. This helps me filter out my thoughts and figure out what I need to action. It allows me to step back and think about things from a more macro perspective rather than getting bogged down by Slack messages or emails. I find it gives me a helpful vantage point.

For the voice note tool, is there a tool that you find useful for that? 

Yeah, I might use Apple Notes or directly into Canva Docs. I do a brain dump into Canva Docs and then summarize them. 

Got it. And so you just use the native microphone? 

Exactly. Nothing fancy, just a straightforward setup.
