Okay. One last question, totally different topic: discounting. You worked at Udemy for a long time, and from what I understand, discounting was one of the key reasons Udemy succeeded and one of the big differentiators. I'm curious what you learned about discounting and the power of discounting as a growth lever.

Udemy is an online marketplace for online courses. When I started there around 2012, people were still trying to understand what this online course thing was. They didn't really grasp the value of it or what they were willing to pay. Discounting plays a powerful role in signaling value. By having a high list price, you can bring it down to an affordable price, which may seem obvious, but in the context of online courses, it was crucial.

The list price would often be high—around $100—because it was associated with a college course. However, what people really valued these courses as was more akin to a book. This allowed us to signal high quality through price, which was very murky at that point in online learning. By discounting to $10, which was the typical Udemy deal, we could offer significant discounts, like 99% or 90% off during fire sales. This changed the perceived value and willingness to pay.

Moreover, education is inherently aspirational. Many people missed the point that while we want users to take the course, that's not always the primary job to be done. There's an emotional job that's even more important: the feeling of making progress in one's educational journey. The act of purchasing a course or buying a book itself represents progress. By making the offer enticing and creating a sense of urgency, we allowed people to experience that emotional journey through the act of purchasing.

However, this approach didn't necessarily lead to high retention rates. People could keep coming back to that emotional job repeatedly, and the urgency we created allowed us to tap into that feeling of progress over and over again.
