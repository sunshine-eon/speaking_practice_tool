[05:01] ["Bloodline"]
[05:04] Hari, welcome to the podcast.
[05:06] Thanks for having me.
[05:07] Been a big fan for a long time.
[05:09] I really appreciate that.
[05:10] What a fun story behind this conversation.
[05:13] Let me just ask you, how did you feel
[05:14] when I called DMD on LinkedIn and asked you
[05:17] to be on this podcast because of a random tweet?
[05:20] I felt very honored.
[05:22] Again, I really have followed your work for a while.
[05:24] It's been really amazing to see what you've built,
[05:26] and I'm a huge fan of different builders.
[05:28] And also it was a little bit of an honor
[05:29] that someone, I know we're gonna get into the story
[05:31] in a little bit, but that's, you know,
[05:33] when you work on something oftentimes like jobs
[05:36] and learning, it's rare, I think,
[05:39] that it's in the influencer conversation, right?
[05:42] It's not necessarily something you or other people
[05:44] are probably experiencing on day to day.
[05:46] So sometimes I don't know if we get to tell
[05:47] some of these stories, and I really appreciate
[05:49] you reaching out for that.
[05:50] Yeah, absolutely.
[05:51] So I guess let me just give a big thank you
[05:53] to Jatin Rajvanshi, also known as the Curious PM,
[05:57] who tweeted about this concept and then was like,
[06:01] hey, talk to Hari about LinkedIn.
[06:03] So thank you, Jatin, for making this happen.
[06:06] It was all thanks to you.
[06:08] And usually when this happens,
[06:09] someone tweets a recommendation of someone,
[06:11] they know each other, and I'm like,
[06:12] I don't know, this is kind of some promotion
[06:14] of some other person, but you guys don't know each other, right?
[06:17] I don't, I'm looking forward to meeting you,
[06:19] and thank you again for putting in the word.
[06:20] Absolutely, and also thank you to Jatin
[06:23] for recommending a bunch of questions
[06:25] that I'm gonna ask you.
[06:26] That I didn't know, so maybe I shouldn't have.
[06:29] That I didn't know, but thanks again, Jatin.
[06:31] It's very kind of you.
