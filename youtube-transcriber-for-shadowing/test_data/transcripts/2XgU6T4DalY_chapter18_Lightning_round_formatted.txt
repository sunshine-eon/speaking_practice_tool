Chapter 18: Lightning round
Video: How Netflix builds a culture of excellence | Elizabeth Stone (CTO)
Time: 67:40 - 73:44
============================================================

Well, with that, we reached our very exciting lightning round. First question: what are two or three books that you recommend most to other people? It's probably a little recency bias, but I've been recommending "What I Talk About When I Talk About Running" by Murakami. It’s about introspection and the similarities between running and writing as flow states and very meditative experiences. I had read some of his fiction books, and the autobiographical reflection on these types of professions or hobbies is very insightful. So that's one.

Another longtime favorite of mine is "A Fine Balance" by Mistry. It’s just a great story of human complexity, challenge, and relationships. I’m drawn to both books and TV and film that explore the human experience.

Speaking of TV and film, this is maybe a high-stakes question for someone who works at Netflix: do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show? I’m not going to name all Netflix titles; that feels like an advertisement. However, the film "Triangle of Sadness" is phenomenal if you haven’t seen it. For TV, I’d go with "Beef," which I thought was hysterical. I’m an Ali Wong fan, and it has a pretty unique storyline. Plus, I think it just won a bunch of Emmys. Amazing picks!

Next question: do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates during interviews? With high talent density, I’m usually looking for someone who would be better in my role than I am. So, I often ask candidates what their priorities would be and what they would do differently if they had my job.

Moving on, do you have a favorite product that you recently discovered and really like? While I carry the CTO title, I live a pretty analog life. My most recent product is a Fellow pour-over coffee maker, which is part of my morning ritual. I take great lengths in my coffee-making process because I find it calming. And while it’s not a recent find, I have to shout out that my Peloton is probably my favorite product. 

Is it the bike or the treadmill? The bike. I’m a recovering outdoor cyclist, so it’s kind of questionable if I can even admit to this, but I love the Peloton despite ideally being an outdoor cyclist.

I have questions about your cycling, but before that, do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to or share with friends or family? My mom said something to me that has stuck with me: "Something good happens every day." She said it to encourage me to be more mindful about enjoying the small things in day-to-day life rather than getting caught up in the busyness. 

Beautiful. Final question: you're a big biker and triathlete. I’m curious what that sport and time have given you in your career or in life. What benefits have you found from spending so much time and energy running, biking, and being an athlete? Certainly, mental resilience. While those sound like physical strengths, I’ve found that especially in endurance sports, it’s much more about mental endurance—how you go through the highs and lows, sustain yourself, and come back from challenges. Those sports have their highs and lows, and from the lows, I’ve really learned how to recover and bounce back. Those feel like universally applicable skills.

It’s such an interesting mix of athleticism and Netflix; what a good balance for life! This is going to give me permission to go watch Netflix after recording this on a Friday afternoon. Elizabeth, you’re awesome. Thank you so much for being here. 

Two final questions: where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe follow up on things? And how can listeners be useful to you? You can always find me on LinkedIn, so definitely reach out or ping me if you have questions or comments. I think the way listeners can be useful to me is by being curious about how they can show up even better in their lives now that we’ve done this reflection on Netflix culture and how we show up for others. I’d like to ask listeners to pay that forward to the people they’re working with.

Amazing! I love that. If you end up doing this and you’re listening, maybe leave a comment on YouTube or in the Substack with something you’ll cover about yourself. Elizabeth, thank you so much for being here.
