============================================================

I know that this is a big part of Netflix culture, and I want to get into it. But before that, I'm curious just what that looks like with people that report to you. How do you help them level up in this skill of having a really high bar? An example I'll give as you think about this is the way I describe this to my PMs: you want to have this aura that you've got this. If you give Lenny something, he's got this. He's going to follow up, he's going to close the loop, he's going to get it done. If he can't get it done, he'll tell me. I feel like this thread will not disappear. You want to drop this ball. Is there anything that you've learned is a good way to help someone learn this kind of skill?

I understand why this is so important. It shows up for the people who report to me as one part example setting. If I don't do it, why would they do it? I treat that very seriously; we should all be held to the same standards. As a second thing, I give feedback when it's not up to the standard. One of the things I've observed, especially with people on my teams, is that the expectations aren't always clear. You can't assume that they're clear if you don't share them. When something's not meeting expectations or really showing up as excellence, I think it's a combination of both giving feedback on that and being direct about it. I also need to be specific about what it would take to get this to the bar that I'm expecting or to show up in the way that I'm expecting.

The third and probably most important thing is helping them fill that gap. For example, it certainly has happened frequently in many jobs: a document is okay, it's not great, and it's not going to be easy for people to follow. It's not as crisp as it could be, and there are things that would strengthen it. I can both give the feedback on that to make sure, yes, it's going to take another round of iteration. Yes, we're going to have to work another week on this and not be done with it. But pushing people to get there and then jumping into the document and helping is crucial. I feel very strongly about this, and that's kind of what I mean by setting an example: let's work on this together. Through that, I help people up-level themselves. The next time around, they know the expectations and have had help getting there in the past. 

That's probably happened a thousand times in my career, where I jump in with both feet because something needs to be better. I think the teams are better for it afterwards, or I hope they are. I think that's such a good framework: set expectations that the bar is going to be really high and here's what I'm expecting from you. Give them very specific feedback on where the gap is and then help them build that gap. A lot of people may feel this and hear this and think, "Oh man, I don't want a manager with such high expectations." It just feels really stressful. But I've had these managers, and I feel like that's when I've learned the most and leveled up the most. Having someone that gave me really high expectations and helped me understand where I wasn't doing as well as I could has been invaluable. 

I know you can do better; go back and work on this. I know that sounds annoying, but I think in practice, it ends up helping you the most in your career. I imagine you've seen a similar result. I think so. I mean, you'd have to ask some of the people on my team. I might look at it differently than they do. It's a hard skill because it's not always easy to give feedback, especially if you feel like someone's put a lot of effort into something. I give a lot of thought to how I deliver that feedback so it feels like we're on the same team. I'm trying to help them be successful, not to encourage failure.

That's where I think that third piece of the framework of jumping in to help can make people feel like they're in a safe space. My manager wants me to be successful; my manager's helping me here. I often do that behind the scenes. Maybe that's another flavor of this: I don't do it live in the big meeting in front of everyone where the presentation doesn't go very well. I do it afterwards, where it feels like a safer space to say, "Here's a way this could have gone better. Let's think about this differently next time." This approach gives people a little grace and an ability to absorb that feedback without feeling like it's on a stage.
