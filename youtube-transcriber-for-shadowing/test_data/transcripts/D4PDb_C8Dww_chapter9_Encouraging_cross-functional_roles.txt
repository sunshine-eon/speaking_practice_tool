============================================================

[00:00] I'll come back to a thread that something you mentioned where you and a lot of the early
[00:03] team had felt extreme ownership over the company, and that's why a lot of this stuff happened.
[00:10] For people that like every founder, every product team, they're going to like, yes,
[00:13] we need that.
[00:14] Let's make sure everyone on the team feels extreme ownership.
[00:16] Is there anything you think that the early team did to create that or is it hiring?
[00:20] Just pick people that will have that feeling already, or is it something or is it cultural?
[00:26] I think it's both.
[00:27] I mean, it's definitely cultural.
[00:28] I think it comes from the top, and I think that Tony exhibits this extreme ownership and
[00:35] looks for it in others, so I think that it that helps, but I think even today, I expect
[00:43] of my team that same kind of extreme ownership over the outcomes, and so I'm more interested
[00:50] in our team figuring out how to solve a problem than sort of the box that someone fits in.
[00:56] I am a data scientist, and so I only do these things.
[00:59] It's like, no, yes, I mean, yes, you are a data scientist, but your goal is to figure
[01:06] out what's happening, and if that means that you're going to pick up the phone and call
[01:09] customers, then that is what you're going to do, and I think that expecting that
[01:15] and setting that as the norm for the team, this sort of ownership of the outcome is
[01:20] something that we continue to do at DoorDash and instill in everyone, whether you were early
[01:27] or just joined last month.
[01:30] Is there an example that comes to mind if someone practicing extreme ownership like a data scientist
[01:34] calling someone or something along those lines?
[01:37] Yeah, so I actually had a meeting yesterday morning with the team that's working on some
[01:42] of our affordability initiatives, and we had shipped something that we expected to
[01:49] work and it didn't, and instead of, you can dig into the data to understand the segments of
[01:54] consumers that you would expect it to work with and those that it wouldn't, of course
[01:59] we did that, but ultimately it was like, I don't know why, and that's where qualitative
[02:04] research is superior to quantitative research, is that asking for the context, actually
[02:10] talking to people to figure out what was the motivation, what worked what didn't
[02:14] for them, and so the team, data scientists included just sat and made phone calls, and
[02:20] so they were talking about what they found from those phone calls and that's going to
[02:25] inform future decisions, and I think rather than saying, well, that's what the qualitative
[02:31] research team is supposed to do, it was like, no, no, that is what our team, anyone's
[02:35] team is supposed to do, because that's what's needed to unblock us from this
[02:40] next test that we want to run, because we need to know what we're testing, so I think
[02:45] that it happens every day. I think I really love when I see team members go outside the
[02:52] sort of traditional bounds of what a data science role might be and do some product
[02:59] management work, do some engineering work. I think that that's part of what keeps
[03:06] the job interesting. I think it's part of what makes our team special is that that is
[03:11] not only allowed, it's encouraged, which is, and probably also a reason why we've had
[03:18] folks who've gone from my team to the product org and to the ops org and to the
[03:24] finance org is because they get to do and experience parts of that job and get a good
[03:29] sense for what that's like and then realize it's something that they love. So I
[03:33] think it's definitely something we encourage at DoorDash.
[03:38] I love that. I want to move in a slightly different direction. When your colleagues
[03:43] told me that you're incredibly good at defining metrics, which is so important
[03:48] to get right for a business, especially when it's complex at DoorDash, and I
[03:52] hear you're especially good at finding the right metric to drive the right
[03:56] incentive, especially when the business is really messy and things like that.
[03:59] So I'm just curious.
