============================================================

Maybe a last question around just the culture. We talked about candor a bit. I'm just curious if there's an example that comes to mind of an example of candor that you recently saw or had to be the candid person that might be interesting to share where it's like, oh wow, that's what you mean when you say a culture of candor.

There's a couple things that come to mind. I am generally a transparent leader, meaning I share information freely and openly. It's part of the culture to context, not control, which means part of my job is to make sure that people have the context they need to do their jobs well. In practice, that means I take notes in leadership meetings and I share those notes with the whole organization. Sometimes it includes candor around reflections on things that aren't going well or problems we need to solve. Sometimes it's just letting people know here's what leadership is talking about so that they have a sense of what's top of mind. 

But it's a version of transparency that I feel strongly about. It doesn't exist a lot of other places. I think it's a version of candor too in being able to share. We can't only share every detail of everything that we're talking about, but I do try to share things that probably push the boundary a little bit in the team feeling like they understand what's happening across the company and what I'm thinking about.

Then there's a second example that comes to mind, which is until two years ago, individual contributors didn't have levels at Netflix. So all engineers were just senior engineers. All data scientists were senior data scientists. We did not have a leveling system. We introduced IC levels two years ago, almost exactly. It was a big, big, big shift because it was seen as something that was sort of sacred. A lot of people came to Netflix because we didn't have it. We didn't have process around promotions. This is probably part of why we never had performance reviews because promotions really weren't at play. It gave people a sense of freedom of not having to worry about that type of structure.

But when you get to a scale of an organization, we needed some type of scaffolding to say, we want to talk about how we compose teams. Like when do we need the person who has 30 years of experience? When do we want to have a new grad? Because that's what the work requires. We didn't have a language for it. So I introduced levels a couple years ago, and we had quite a change roller coaster. It's the only way I can describe how it went. That's a good phrase. It was sort of like being in like the tumble dry machine for a few months.

So really talking through it with the team, that's just context and backdrop for an example of candor recently. We had kind of a postmortem or retro on how has it gone with IC levels. It's kind of like Wells, not Wells. I would normally think in a lot of cultures, it would be like, well, we got past that change, we're living that change. Like, don't reflect on it because that kind of opens some of that early debate. I felt differently about it. 

I think it's a good example of being candid about this was a big change for us. It hasn't all gone perfectly. There's a lot that we can do better in how we implement levels at Netflix. I would rather share that information than pretend it's all gone swimmingly and we achieved every objective. I think that I try to build examples like that because I do think that level of candor and reflection helps build a sense of community and trust across the team.
