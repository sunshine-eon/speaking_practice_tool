============================================================

[00:00] We have this incredible new tab called the listing tab that we designed.
[00:05] It's quite possibly one of the nicest things we were designed.
[00:08] If you go to my Twitter account, you'll see a little sizzle reel from some of
[00:11] the design we've done.
[00:12] By the way, the design is a whole new aesthetic.
[00:16] I'd like to like make the announcement that I think flat design is over or ending.
[00:20] You know, I think if you remember the 2000s was dominated by skeu morphism.
[00:24] The 2010s have been dominated with a launch of iOS seven by flat design.
[00:29] I think we're going to move back into a world with color, texture, dimensionality,
[00:34] more haptic feedback, but I don't think it's going to be skeu morphism where it
[00:39] pretends to be like a woodgrain to reference like a dashboard or leather.
[00:44] But I think it's going to have a sense of dimension.
[00:46] I think the reason why is we're spending more and more time on screens and we
[00:51] want the screens to replicate some of what we see in the natural environment,
[00:55] light, texture.
[00:57] I think it's more intuitive.
[00:59] It's more playful.
[01:00] I think AI allows the development of more sophisticated interfaces.
[01:04] People in AI are gravitating to image generating art that has got more a dimension
[01:10] to it.
[01:11] And so I think that we've really started to push this more three-dimensional,
[01:16] colorful aesthetic that I think, I think it's going to be where a lot of
[01:19] interface design is going.
[01:21] And we built this AI powered photo tour where we created our own AI computer
[01:26] visioning language that we trained on a hundred million photos and it can basically
[01:30] scan all your photos and organize them by room.
[01:33] So that's what we did today.
[01:35] Maybe just to round it up, what I would say is that none of this would have
[01:39] been possible in the old way of working.
[01:40] You know, we could have theoretically launched a lot of these features, but
[01:44] you know, really getting them to work together has been key.
[01:47] And guest favorites has required the guests, the people, you know, you have to
[01:52] work with guests, you have to work a host.
[01:54] You have to essentially, you know, you have to, you have to like figure out
[01:59] how to communicate to the market.
[02:00] So it's a much more integrated approach.
[02:03] The designs you talked about, they are incredibly cute.
[02:05] You tweeted a little video of a lot of them, like the couch with little textures
[02:09] on it and it is really cool.
[02:12] Also the listing tab, I think people that aren't hosts don't understand
[02:16] how important the listing experience is to a host.
[02:18] That's like, I think how many hosts are there?
[02:20] Seven million, something like that.
[02:22] There's, there's, there's seven million listings.
[02:24] Yeah.
[02:24] Oh, seven million listings.
[02:26] Yeah.
[02:26] And so that's like the home base.
[02:28] That's like the small business platform for millions of people.
[02:32] And so I worked on the host sites.
[02:33] I have a special place in my heart for host features.
[02:35] And I feel like travelers don't really appreciate the value of that part of the product.
[02:39] Well, yeah, you did some amazing work there.
[02:41] Yeah.
[02:41] I think that like the big lesson, Lenny, the other thing we learned is to
[02:46] create a great guest experience, you need great host and to have great host,
[02:50] the great tools.
[02:52] And so if you want to create a great experience for guests, it often starts with
[02:55] building great tools for hosts to enable.
