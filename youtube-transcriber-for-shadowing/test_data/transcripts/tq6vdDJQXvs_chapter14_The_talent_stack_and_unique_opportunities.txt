============================================================

[00:00] Maybe a couple more questions while I have you here.
[00:03] One is this idea of the talent stack.
[00:05] You mentioned this concept before, and this is the term that I've seen you describe it
[00:08] as, of this idea of the power of focusing on your unique talents and curiosity and
[00:13] that leading you to the biggest opportunities, especially early in your career.
[00:18] So you just talk about what you've kind of, your insight there.
[00:21] Yeah.
[00:22] Again, I only lived one life, so I have no, I can't Monte Carlo all the decisions
[00:27] I make and just figure out which ones ended up being lot bearing, right?
[00:30] Like, so I'm at this point pretty amused by the following thing which keeps happening,
[00:34] but like, I'm getting curious about some absolutely random thing.
[00:38] It really is like fairly far flung stuff.
[00:42] And like magic, it becomes the way that ends up allowing me to make a very important
[00:50] choice like a year later.
[00:53] It's like ends up being a better analogy, better fluent or a different way to see
[00:58] something or another like idea that I found being represented in this area of
[01:07] expertise that is actually just again, another repackaging of another
[01:12] foundational idea which allows me to go and like look for more examples.
[01:15] And it's just funny this way.
[01:16] So even early in career, just like I follow my curiosity, I love programming
[01:20] and I love computers and I love the internet when it came along.
[01:24] And I just like, cool, I'm going to find a task that I find valuable, which I was
[01:28] sort of like always engaged in retail.
[01:31] And I can, I have a lot to say about how retail should be brought to
[01:39] like buy the internet to people.
[01:41] Like it's that just that this is like a beautiful intersection of all the
[01:45] things that I find interesting.
[01:47] And then like on top of it, I found Ruby, which I loved as a technology.
[01:51] And then, you know, just now I had like, I was highly motivated to tinker,
[01:56] explore a space that was clearly emergent, but like just felt very
[02:00] obviously of value in the future.
[02:02] But like, I didn't do it because I was falling money.
[02:04] I did it because I was like, I like learning by doing stuff.
[02:08] And I like, I like tinkering the things.
[02:11] And so this was a way of financing my tinkering by selling snowboards.
[02:16] And then it led to other things.
[02:19] And just I've kind of been doing that thing all along.
[02:22] And it's like, it's, it's, it's great fun, great fun for me.
[02:26] I don't know how much of a advice that is, but maybe a proof point
[02:31] that that can work really well.
[02:34] I, I, I sometimes variable that like things like this end up being a
[02:37] little bit like, you know, all you need to do is buy lottery tickets
[02:43] set for lottery ticket winner.
[02:44] But so it's, who knows?
[02:48] It does resonate.
[02:49] It reminds me of something Brighton Armstrong once shared, which is
[02:52] like the reason that he is also by way, like you, you have to
[02:56] add him to the set of first principle thinkers, if you're
[02:59] starting to cultivate one.
[03:00] And I think there's plenty of, like plenty of startup success,
[03:06] like successful founders, CEOs, especially for public companies
[03:11] are surprisingly alike in, in, in this projecting slightly
[03:16] different, maybe coming from different backgrounds.
[03:18] But like, yeah, yeah, Brian is extraordinarily strong at this.
[03:24] Okay, here's the next nominated for the podcast, Brian, we'll
[03:27] get on it.
[03:29] But interestingly, he had basically exact same advice for
[03:32] what allowed him to create coin bases.
[03:34] His background was economics, coding and like cryptography
[03:38] or something along those lines.
[03:40] And this, like the Venn diagram is like, this is the thing
[03:43] I'm uniquely strong at and have an opportunity to win at.
[03:46] Yeah.
[03:47] Yeah.
[03:47] So this is what we very actively tell our customers, right?
[03:50] Like there's a 2005 essay by Kevin Kelly saying, like, in a
[03:55] future on the internet, you just need a thousand true
[03:57] fans.
[03:58] It's like, that is what the internet and I think what
[04:00] Shopify celebrates that instead of trying to create
[04:05] two faced, which is of course a huge term, but hard to
[04:11] differentiate, it's much better to figure out a triplicate
[04:16] intersection of three different things and like nail it.
[04:23] Like I, we took a winter vacation with my boys and my
[04:27] family are like in a Caribbean.
[04:30] And I like playing poker with them.
[04:32] And just like it's, I mean, just I like playing poker and
[04:35] it's like, it's great limited information game.
[04:37] And I think this was valuable for kids.
[04:40] And so I found this, like, I might have mentioned this
[04:46] sometimes I'm up next, but I found this like a pirate
[04:49] gold, I think it's called, it's like just like amazing,
[04:51] like poker set, poker chips that I look like to become
[04:55] right out of the treasure chest in Pirates of Caribbean.
[04:58] Like think about just the intersection.
[05:00] So it's like, this is online.
[05:01] Textiles hold them like quality poker set instead of,
[05:05] because you can play with like just like anything, right?
[05:08] Like I don't need, people were in the market for making,
[05:11] spending money on something like this and pirate themed.
[05:15] Like it's like, you're like, but I'm such a big fan.
[05:20] I'm telling you about it and people might actually
[05:23] purchase it because I'm enthusiastic about it.
[05:26] And because enthusiasm is actually the best marketing.
[05:33] And they have at least a thousand true fans.
[05:39] And it's just better to make amazing things for some
[05:41] people than like make something that everyone wants
[05:44] maybe or would tolerate.
[05:46] And I think that's really, really good.
