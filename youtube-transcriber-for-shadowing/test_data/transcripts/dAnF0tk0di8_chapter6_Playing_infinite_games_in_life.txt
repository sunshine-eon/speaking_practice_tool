============================================================

[00:00] You also have no investors. You have no board. You have no plans to go public. You have no plans to sell the business
[00:05] Right. There's this book. I don't know if you've read this book called find it in infinite games
[00:09] No, I've done. Okay. I think this is I think you would love it. So the whole premise of this book
[00:14] It's like very it's like a terse kind of tricky philosophical book
[00:17] But it's very short and it kind of espouses you want to be playing
[00:20] Infinite games to be happy in life games that never end
[00:23] Versus games like I'm gonna build a business and sell it. I'm gonna go public. That's my goal
[00:27] Or I want to achieve this promotion like you get most joy out of things that never I'm like building great relationships
[00:34] Building a company you want to keep working that forever? I like that. And you know, it's interesting is I've always thought of my career this way
[00:40] So when I got my first job I was 13
[00:43] Worked in a grocery store for a bit and I worked in a shoe store and after that I like maybe when I was 15
[00:50] I got a resellers license, which was this thing you could you could this is way back in the day
[00:55] There's a couple I think there's they still exist company called Ingram micro D
[00:58] Which was a which had this huge thick catalog of like electronics equipment
[01:02] And if you had a resellers license you could buy these things at wholesale prices, then I could sell them to my friends for
[01:08] Retail, which is like almost 2x wholesale and
[01:11] Even though I'm not selling an electronics equipment today. I'm selling software instead
[01:16] I feel like I have the exact same job as I did when I was 15 that this is a long continuum of
[01:21] Finding stuff that I like in this case today. It's building things that I like
[01:25] Insign them to like-minded people who also would find them useful or like those things too
[01:29] So whether or not it's software or electronics or or stereo equipment or whatever the heck it is or music organizing databases
[01:37] Whatever it is like it's all the same to me and I just want to keep doing it like this is my day job
[01:42] I think the other thing that's interesting my entrepreneurship is
[01:45] Sometimes there's a sense of like there's you can get a job or you can be an entrepreneur
[01:49] well an entrepreneur is a job and
[01:52] Like I want to this is my job
[01:54] And so I want to create the company that I want to work at and I want to keep doing this job for as long as I can
[02:01] As long as I'm useful. I'm good at it. I enjoy it. I want to keep doing that
[02:06] And so to like get in bed with an investment that would say like in five years
[02:11] You have to stop doing what you're doing. You're gonna get a big paycheck
[02:13] Maybe but you got to stop doing what you're doing so we're gonna sell this business
[02:17] You're gonna have to work for this other company for two years and do their thing and then eventually after that's over
[02:21] You'll leave and you'll go start another thing like that just has no appeal to me at all
[02:25] I'd rather just keep doing the thing that I'm enjoying doing as long as I can continue to make it work
[02:28] And what's cool about having a company like ours, which is an independent business
[02:32] We don't have to ask anyone for permission
[02:35] No one can tell us no and so we can turn this into anything we want
[02:39] it's this vehicle more so than it is a
[02:42] Software business that happens to be of course what it is but it could be something else
[02:47] As well and and there's no limits to what it could be and that's kind of a fun way to go through life, too
[02:52] And this in this all-terrain vehicle, which can kind of go anywhere on road off road
[02:57] Whatever and and you can kind of get anywhere you need to go and that's sort of what's really I think quite fun about the kind of
