============================================================

[00:00] So let's talk about AI first.
[00:01] It feels like there's this like being in the right place at the right time.
[00:06] Feels like you guys are like, we've been building this for a while and then AI
[00:09] just unlocked another stage in what you're able to do with email.
[00:14] I guess just talk about what you've done and how you think about AI integrating
[00:17] into what you're doing, how it's enabled you to kind of take off again.
[00:23] It's true that sometimes startups boil down to being in the right place at the right time.
[00:30] And we actually had a massive AI launch recently about two weeks ago.
[00:34] But even before then, we had multiple flagship AI features.
[00:39] Our first AI feature was right with AI,
[00:41] dropped down a few words and will turn them into a fully written email.
[00:45] We actually match the voice and tone in the emails you've already sent.
[00:48] So unlike Copilot, unlike Gemini, unlike basically every other email app,
[00:52] the email sounds like you.
[00:55] And this AI feature is way more popular than I expected it to be
[00:59] on average today, users are using it 37 times per week.
[01:04] Number two, our next AI feature was Auto Summarize,
[01:07] which shows a one line summary above every conversation.
[01:11] And as new emails arrive, it updates instantly again,
[01:14] unlike Copilot and Gemini, it's pre-computed.
[01:17] One of the things we do is we go above and beyond to make these features
[01:19] really premium and feel amazing.
[01:22] The next AI feature after that was Instant Reply.
[01:27] Imagine waking up to an inbox where every email already has a draft reply.
[01:33] You would simply edit and then send.
[01:35] And sometimes you wouldn't even need to edit.
[01:38] And I can share, because we just finished this analysis,
[01:41] that over 2024, the percentage of emails
[01:44] that are AI written and sent with Superhuman has grown four times, just in one year.
[01:51] Then if I remember correctly, the feature after that was Ask AI.
[01:56] Email, of course, is this treasure trove of critical information,
[02:00] things like project statuses, customer communication,
[02:03] meeting updates, deal execution and so much more.
[02:05] And for over 40 years, we've had to rely on what we literally call Search.
[02:10] You have to remember senders, guess keywords, scan subject lines.
[02:14] And now you can just ask, where is the key one offsite?
[02:18] Or what are my flight details?
[02:20] Or what is the top five most positive customer responses to the Ask AI launch?
[02:27] A task, by the way, which previously used to take me 20 or 30 minutes
[02:32] to read through all the emails and then create that report,
[02:36] now happening in less than five seconds.
[02:39] And recently, we, like I said, announced our biggest evolution yet.
[02:44] And Superhuman AI is constantly helping you.
[02:46] It's organizing your inbox.
[02:48] It's also making sure you never drop the ball.
[02:51] So we have things that we call auto labels.
[02:54] You can now write a short prompt like job applications or requests to review work.
[03:00] And you can then immediately see when emails match that prompt,
[03:04] when people apply for a job or they ask you to review work with auto reminders.
[03:09] If your email needs a response, Superhuman will now automatically set a reminder.
[03:13] You don't have to remember to do that.
[03:15] Then you'll never drop the ball again.
[03:17] All you need to do is hit send with auto drafts.
[03:22] Superhuman will now automatically draft your follow up emails for you
[03:25] and will soon be drafting replies to basically every email that needs a response.
[03:30] And finally, with what we call workflows, you can now turn email
[03:36] into repeatable automated workflows.
[03:40] For example, I often get emails from people who are interested in working at Superhuman.
[03:45] And I would normally reply to that candidate and I would let them know
[03:48] that the team will take a look.
[03:50] I'll then forward the original message, including any resume or any letter
[03:54] to our head of people and operations and ask her to reach out if interested.
[03:59] With workflows, I can now automate this entire process.
[04:03] And it's you can imagine sort of crazy, a little flowchart of what has to happen.
[04:08] Not only does that save a huge amount of time,
[04:12] with workflows, you don't even have to be in your inbox.
[04:16] In fact, you don't even have to be working.
[04:18] You could be on vacation while Superhuman AI is working for you.
[04:24] This sounds like product market fit to me.
[04:26] This all sounds wonderful.
[04:27] Like it just makes sense.
[04:28] This is the stuff we've been promised or underwater cities and flying cars.
[04:33] And then just email that just works magically and replies for us and all these things.
[04:37] So I love all these things you're doing for folks that are
[04:41] building with AI.
[04:42] I'm curious to just what's been maybe been the biggest surprise, either good or bad,
[04:48] building so deeply on top of AI models that you think might be helpful for folks
[04:52] to just like watch out for this or, hey, check this out.
[04:56] I think for me, the biggest surprise has been how unpredictable
[05:03] the user love has been in terms of what they love and what they don't love.
[05:07] For example, right with AI.
[05:09] This sounds like a commodity feature and on a surface level, it is every email app.
[05:13] Every writing surface has a right with AI feature in.
[05:16] I would wager hours is the best at emails.
[05:18] And surprisingly, that's what we do.
[05:21] But the surprising thing was just how much people love it and how often it gets used.
[05:29] Thirty seven times per user per week is still mind blowing to me.
[05:35] I had not expected that.
[05:36] So that that's the most surprising thing.
[05:38] And on the flip side, there were certain AI features where I did expect a ton of usage,
[05:43] but we didn't quite get the usage that we were perhaps hoping for.
[05:48] And hopefully I'm not AI Kramer, but basically everything I thought would work out.
[05:54] Well, people use it less than they thought they did and everything I was like, I don't know,
[05:57] but let's build the thing.
[05:58] People love that.
[06:00] So interesting.
[06:01] Yeah.
[06:01] Maybe I should just create an anti-meet to do AI road mapping.
[06:06] That's a simple agent right there.
[06:07] Whatever a whole.
