Okay, next topic that I'm excited to get your take on is game design versus gamification. This is one of the more unique ways to think about designing products. When people hear you talk about this, they think it's like, "Oh, gamification, making things like games. Oh, that's Zynga Farmville. I don't want to do that." We actually have a really different perspective on how to make and why you need to think about game design as you design products. Talk about your insights there.

Yeah, well, I strongly believe that we should make business software like we make games. Because when we make products like we make games, people find them fun. They tell their friends; they fall in love with them. It's another way, actually, backing into where we opened this conversation, which is you're making a brand. You're giving reason for word of mouth. It's actually an altogether different kind of product development. 

So how do we do this? Well, as you said, it's not gamification. That doesn't work. Game design works. Game design is not gamification. It's not, for example, simply taking your product and adding points, levels, trophies, or badges. To understand why gamification does not work, we actually have to start with human motivation. There's a very interesting study from Stanford that demonstrates the difference perfectly. 

In the 1970s, these Stanford researchers recruited children who were age three to four years old, and all of these kids were generally pre-interested in drawing. Some kids were told they would get a reward—a certificate with a gold seal and a ribbon—and some kids were not told about any reward and did not even expect one or didn't know of one. Now, each child was then invited into a separate room to draw for six minutes, and afterwards, they would either get the reward or not. Over the next few days, the children were observed to see how much they would continue to draw by themselves. 

The children with no reward spent 17% of their time drawing, but the children who expected a reward sadly only spent eight percent of their time drawing. The very presence of a reward halved their motivation. So what's happening? Researchers differentiate intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation. With intrinsic motivation, we do things because they are inherently interesting and satisfying, and with extrinsic motivation, we do things to earn rewards and to achieve external goals. 

And that's the problem with rewards: they just massively undermine intrinsic motivation. That's why gamification doesn't work. When gamification does work, it's because the underlying experience was already designed like a game. What makes something feel like a game? I know Superhuman is really good at this, like you're in inbox zero, a quest that you're on. I guess just to make that a little more real, what is game design? What does that mean to you? What makes it feel like a game?

Well, many of you folks don't know this, but before I was a founder, I was actually a professional game designer. As it turns out, there is no unifying theory of game design. To create games, we need to draw upon the arts and the science of psychology, mathematics, storytelling, interaction design. At Superhuman, we've identified five key areas that we really care about: goals, emotions, toys, controls, and flow. Across these, we've identified many principles of game design. 

One example principle would be to make fun toys and then combine those into games. So a question I like to ask is: are toys the same as games? They do seem different. For example, we play with toys, but we play games. A ball is a toy; a football is a game. As it turns out, the best games are constructed out of toys. Why? Because then they are fun on both levels—the toy and the game itself.

For example, in Superhuman, one of our favorite toys is the time auto-completer. If you use Superhuman, this is the thing that appears when you hit H when you snooze or set reminders on emails. You can type whatever you want; it can be gibberish, and it does its best to understand you. For example, if you type in "2d," that becomes "two days." "3h" is "three hours," and "1mo" is "one month." The time auto-completer is fun because it indulges your playful exploration. 

In onboardings, it wasn't long before I saw people asking, "What can it do? Where does it break? How does it work?" What happens if I keep on typing in a series of tens? Well, it turns out that's October the 10th at 10:10 p.m. Or how about the series of twos? Well, that's February the 2nd, 2022, at 2 p.m. Then you start trying more complex inputs, like "in a fortnight and a day," and that works, which is a pleasant surprise. It's not long before you find more pleasant surprises, like time zone math happens without you thinking about it. 

You can just type in "8 a.m. in Tokyo," and it turns out that's 8 p.m. Eastern time, and you no longer have to do the time zone math. Most people were really delighted to find out that if you really want, you can snooze emails until never. You can literally type in "never," and the email will never come back. I had like a little shrug emoji at the same time. 

So, you know, is this toy going to win awards? Nope. But is it fun? Actually, surprisingly, yes. So what I would encourage people to do is think about the features of their product. Do those features indulge playful exploration? Are they fun even without a goal? Do they elicit moments of pleasant surprise? If so, you have a toy, and you can combine that with other toys and actually start to build a game. If people were to listen to this segment of the podcast, they would never guess we're talking about B2B software and email.
