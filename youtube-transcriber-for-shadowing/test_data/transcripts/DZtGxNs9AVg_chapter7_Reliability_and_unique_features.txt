Video: Building Lovable: $10M ARR in 60 days with 15 people | Anton Osika (CEO and co-founder)
Time: 33:20 - 36:25
============================================================

[00:00] This is a paid ad.
[00:01] Okay, I want to come back to the team because I know you have a lot of thoughts there.
[00:05] In terms of writing code, how much do you guys actually use AI to write the code that is
[00:09] building lovable?
[00:10] How does that work on your team?
[00:12] We have set up lovable so that we can change lovable with itself.
[00:16] We have done that.
[00:19] There is a lot of hyper-specific things in terms of running a separate, like we spin
[00:29] up a dedicated computer for each user.
[00:32] It doesn't do everything, lovable doesn't do everything.
[00:36] So we use the tools that are for developers, not for the 99%, most of the time.
[00:43] And everyone uses AI all the time in writing code.
[00:47] It's also a great course for experimentation.
[00:50] And other tools like cursor and stuff like that, like any tools you can share recommend.
[00:53] I think cursor is the one that almost everyone uses in the team.
[00:59] Yeah, okay, cool.
[01:00] I did a survey recently on tools that my listeners and readers use in cursor.
[01:05] Like 17% of all people that read my newsletter use cursor already, which is absurd.
[01:11] And you guys are in there too.
[01:12] Okay, so kind of along these lines, there's obviously other competitors and companies
[01:16] in this space, so everyone's always wondering.
[01:19] You bold, replete, cursor is a different kind of thing.
[01:22] What's the simplest way to understand maybe how lovable might be different from say bold
[01:26] and replete, which I think are probably the closest?
[01:30] The packaging for non-technical people is what we aim for.
[01:36] I showed you in the demo that you can edit the text, like you can change the colors
[01:41] and so on instantly without having to go into like a code editor and without having
[01:47] to wait this about 30 seconds for the AI to do the full change.
[01:51] So that's the big way that we think about packaging it.
[01:56] And then for making sure that this can be used as productively as possible in a larger
[02:03] team, something that's different from I think all the other tools is that it is
[02:10] synchronized with the GitHub and that means that you can use cursor or the people
[02:15] in your team that want to be more low level, they can use cursor.
[02:20] While the people who don't want to mess and set up their local file system and
[02:25] commit to GitHub and so on, they can use LavaBoss.
[02:28] Not getting stuck is I think the most important thing for people.
[02:31] And that's why we came, we kind of entered the space late.
[02:34] We haven't done the same type of marketing as many others.
[02:37] And we're still from the people that I talk to ranked as the one that
[02:44] works most reliably.
[02:45] I love it.
[02:46] Okay.
[02:47] So this point about how you can just use LavaBall to build a lot of it for you
[02:53] and then get into cursor to edit and tweak is a really big point.
[02:56] And you're saying other companies aren't as good at that.
[03:00] I don't know any other dust that.
[03:02] I don't even let you do that.
[03:04] Amazing.
[03:04] Okay.
