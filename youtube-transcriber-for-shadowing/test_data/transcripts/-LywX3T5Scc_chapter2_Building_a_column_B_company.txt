============================================================

[00:00] Melany, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.
[00:05] Thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to be here.
[00:07] I'm even more excited. It's such an honor to have you here.
[00:10] I am such a fan of yours. I'm such a fan of the company that you've built.
[00:13] Also, just everyone I meet from Canva is just like so nice and so awesome and so smart.
[00:19] And so clearly you've built something really special.
[00:22] I'm really excited to use this hour to learn as much as I can from you about how you did that.
[00:27] And we were actually chatting ahead of this about what would make the best use of this hour.
[00:31] And I asked you what you believe has been the biggest factor in the success of Canva.
[00:36] And you described something called building a column B company in Columb B Thinking.
[00:41] I've never heard of this before. So let us start there.
[00:44] What is building a Columb B company? What does that mean?
[00:47] Really great place to start. So I guess there's two ways of planning.
[00:51] The way that you can plan is you can dream of like what is the perfect vision of the future?
[00:56] What future do you want to exist in? What would you like the world to look like?
[01:00] What would you like companies to look like?
[01:02] And then going from there, which is completely improbable, a completely crazy big dream,
[01:07] and then working hard to turn that into reality.
[01:10] And the alternative is, so just imagine you're building a castle on the hill
[01:14] and you're like, what would be the most magical, wonderful mythical thing in the world?
[01:18] And you're like, what would be the most magical, wonderful, mythical experience?
[01:22] And the other thing you can do is you can look at the bricks around you
[01:25] and you can say, what can I do with these bricks? How high can I stack them? What can I do?
[01:30] And I think most planning is often done by looking at the bricks and trying to stack them.
[01:35] And then you kind of, you know, you can create only so much.
[01:39] And so I guess the Columb B Thinking is thinking about what is that magical, wonderful future
[01:46] that you then want to invest years and decades of your life actually building.
[01:50] And so that's Columb A and Columb B.
