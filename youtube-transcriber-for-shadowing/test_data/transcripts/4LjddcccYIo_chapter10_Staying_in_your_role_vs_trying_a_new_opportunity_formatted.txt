So, is that advice you often give of going deep into a company or product versus just bouncing around and trying a bunch of different companies? It depends. There are lots of really good reasons to bounce. I've done it, and many people have done it. However, I was surprised at how much I value the experience of having stuck around for a while and how much I learned from it. That was something I hadn't expected going into it, especially because I wasn't hearing that point of view as much when I was thinking about the arc of my career. But I'm glad that I did it.

Of course, people always want to get promoted and often ask that question. My answer is always to create impact, and that can take time. At my first job, I was there for nine years, then I started a company for a year and a half, and after that, we sold to Airbnb. I was at Airbnb for seven years. So, I'm very much on that train of just like, not that I intended for that to happen, but I definitely went deep.

I think there are pros and cons to this approach, but there are so many pros to going deep, and so many reasons to consider it.
