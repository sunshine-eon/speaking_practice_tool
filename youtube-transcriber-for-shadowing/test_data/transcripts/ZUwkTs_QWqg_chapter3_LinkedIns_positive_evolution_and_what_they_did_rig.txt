============================================================

[06:31] It's very kind of you.
[06:32] Yeah, okay, so let's roll into some stuff.
[06:34] I actually wanna start with LinkedIn as a platform broadly.
[06:38] I know you don't work on all parts of LinkedIn
[06:40] and don't necessarily know everything
[06:41] that's going on there, but something I've noticed
[06:43] that's pretty major is it feels like LinkedIn's
[06:46] really made this move from being a very cringy place
[06:50] to post and spend time till it's actually now interesting
[06:55] and the feed that I see on LinkedIn is interesting.
[06:58] Oftentimes, even more interesting than Twitter,
[07:00] which is crazy to say.
[07:02] Also, it's become the biggest source of traffic
[07:05] for my newsletter, more so than Twitter,
[07:07] which I never expected.
[07:09] So my question is, as far as you know,
[07:12] what is it that y'all did right in the past couple of years
[07:15] that has allowed for this shift to happen?
[07:17] Because this was very rare.
[07:18] Well, first, I'm glad you're having a good experience with it,
[07:21] and that's really, really kind of here.
[07:23] So first of all, it's very interesting.
[07:25] You kind of hit on it.
[07:26] Everything at LinkedIn is a very connected ecosystem.
[07:29] And so one of the things that we always think about
[07:32] is how the whole system fits together.
[07:34] And I'm sure we'll get into it more and more
[07:35] about how we build at LinkedIn,
[07:37] but how you make decisions based on that very complicated
[07:40] ecosystem is actually not very difficult
[07:42] because we're all here to help people connect
[07:44] to economic opportunity.
[07:45] Like every time there's a discussion,
[07:47] something I'm really, really proud about working here
[07:49] is everyone knows how that decision is gonna be made.
[07:52] And it's all about how we connect
[07:53] to people with economic opportunity.
[07:55] Now, it was funny, just the other day I was driving,
[07:58] I was in an Uber with the person who runs the feed,
[08:00] who's this guy, Kim Rush, who's just phenomenal.
[08:02] And we were just talking about this.
[08:04] And one of the things he mentioned to me was,
[08:07] if you think about what a feed is
[08:08] when it connects someone to opportunity,
[08:10] it's gotta do a couple of things really, really well.
[08:12] And we've done a ton of member surveys on this,
[08:15] a ton of thought behind it.
[08:16] The first is, as you make relationship connections
[08:19] across the way, that is a real way
[08:20] by which people get opportunity.
[08:22] They keep in touch with those people, they learn.
[08:23] They might follow someone in hopes
[08:25] and getting known to them and getting that knowledge.
[08:26] And we gotta make sure that that content is getting to them.
[08:29] Then when you think outside the network,
[08:32] we have to make sure that the things that people really want,
[08:35] which they keep saying or knowledge and advice
[08:37] and the ability to get the real perspectives
[08:40] they need to get there,
[08:41] those are the things out of network they want.
[08:43] And we've really, really been focused
[08:45] on driving those two systems, right?
[08:47] How does someone connect opportunity
[08:48] both through the people and through the content
[08:50] that they actually want?
[08:51] And as you know, when you do a feed,
[08:53] there's so many decisions to go into that complex system,
[08:56] there's so many decisions.
[08:57] But we've been really, really trying to make sure
[08:59] that we don't lose sight of that
[09:00] and start tuning all those knobs into that direction.
[09:04] So if we're trying to get even more specific
[09:06] with what has changed,
[09:08] clearly there's been like a focus internally.
[09:11] Is that true?
[09:12] There's just like, hey, let's make this feed
[09:13] a lot more interesting, or is this just like a never ending?
[09:16] And then it's actually started to work kind of investment
[09:18] as far as you know.
[09:19] Well, there's always been a focus
[09:20] on connecting people opportunity, right?
[09:22] There's always been a focus on that.
[09:24] And I think what's happened over time
[09:26] is we've gotten more and more clear
[09:28] with what our members really want,
[09:29] which is this ability to feel close to those relationships
[09:32] and the ability to really get that knowledge that they need.
[09:35] And as we've gotten better and kind of clearer
[09:37] in that understanding,
[09:38] and we've been able to dial the knobs in the right way,
[09:39] I hope it's landing in the right place.
[09:41] I'm always kind of, I don't think it's any place
[09:43] near declaring victory in any of our,
[09:45] any part of this product.
[09:46] I think one of the beauty of working with that vision
[09:48] of connecting people opportunity,
[09:50] there is always some piece of friction.
[09:51] There is always something we could be doing better.
[09:53] And so I'm always hesitant to say,
[09:54] you know, we've ever hit that bar.
[09:56] And I know there's probably people who listen to you
[09:58] who probably maybe have not had that experience.
[10:00] And I always encourage you to kind of reach out
[10:02] and let us know ways we can do better.
[10:03] But I'm glad you're having experience with it.
[10:05] And to your point, I always feel that like,
[10:08] as long as we stay focused on that
[10:09] and each of our decisions start moving in that direction,
[10:12] hopefully the product will continue to deliver.
