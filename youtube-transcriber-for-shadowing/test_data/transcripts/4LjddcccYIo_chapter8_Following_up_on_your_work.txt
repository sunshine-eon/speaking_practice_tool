============================================================

[00:00] Slack workspace.
[00:01] Ooh, I love it.
[00:02] Okay, I'm glad we talked on that.
[00:03] Okay, back on track.
[00:05] The second bucket you described is following up on results.
[00:08] How do you, does it just do that?
[00:10] Is there anything more you can add there?
[00:12] I put reminders in my calendar.
[00:14] I mean, yeah, it's just do that.
[00:15] But like if you're launching a product,
[00:18] usually, you know, you release something
[00:20] and you have that initial push of a couple of weeks
[00:22] where you're finding bugs
[00:23] and maybe you're pulling metrics
[00:24] and everyone remembers it,
[00:26] then I would remember two weeks after that,
[00:29] a month after that, six months after that,
[00:31] put a reminder in your calendar to check your dashboard
[00:33] or check the metrics
[00:34] or check whatever it is that you were doing.
[00:36] A, you won't forget
[00:38] and then share them with whoever might care about it.
[00:41] And it's as simple as that.
[00:43] And is the reason this is one of the three things
[00:45] you think are most consistent across grade PMs
[00:48] that it helps your manager see you like, wow,
[00:52] Maggie's so on top of everything
[00:54] or is it more that you learn from that experience
[00:56] and drive more impact or is it both?
[00:59] It's definitely both.
[01:02] I'm not gonna pretend like if you're just great
[01:04] at your job quietly
[01:06] that you're gonna get what you want, right?
[01:07] You're not just if you're toiling in the background,
[01:11] doing a great job, getting results.
[01:12] If you have a great manager, maybe you'll be successful.
[01:16] Great managers are few and far between
[01:18] and I'm of the opinion that I never wanted to rely
[01:21] on someone else to get what I wanted.
[01:24] And so I would always make sure to share that,
[01:27] always make sure to share my progress
[01:28] because I didn't wanna leave it up to chance
[01:30] that someone would notice.
[01:32] So I would suggest doing it for both reasons.
[01:36] And that's one of those things that like,
[01:38] people wanna pretend that everything's perfect
[01:40] and we're all great and we're always gonna get
[01:42] what we want and always gonna get that promotion
[01:44] but you have to work for it.
[01:45] So.
