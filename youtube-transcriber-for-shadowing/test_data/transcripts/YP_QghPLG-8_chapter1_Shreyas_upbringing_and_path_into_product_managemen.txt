Chapter 1: Shreyas’ upbringing and path into product management
Video: The art of product management | Shreyas Doshi (Stripe, Twitter, Google, Yahoo)
Time: 00:00 - 14:22
============================================================

[00:00] You should be spending some time on internal optics because it creates energy, it creates awareness,
[00:06] it creates excitement, it creates opportunities for feedback. Those are all really great things
[00:12] and they will enable greater impact and better execution for you.
[00:18] There's no one out there today who shares more wisdom, more consistently,
[00:22] on the art of product management than Shreyas Doshi. Shreyas kind of came out of nowhere a
[00:26] few years ago and started tweeting gems of insight about building product and the role of
[00:32] product management and rightfully so has built a huge following on Twitter. What I love about Shreyas
[00:38] is that his insights are often framed in really memorable and interesting ways and they're often
[00:44] contrarian and not ideas that you've heard elsewhere. Shreyas has worked at some of today's most
[00:49] important tech companies including Yahoo, Twitter, Google and most recently Stripe both as an
[00:56] IC and a manager and his advice is always rooted in his real-life experiences at these companies.
[01:03] In our chat we focus on five topics and go deep on them. We talk about the power of pre-mortems,
[01:11] we talk about how to best use your time as a product manager, we look into the three levels
[01:16] of product work and how getting them wrong often leads to tension on your team, we dig into why
[01:23] most execution problems are really strategy problems and we talk about a common pitfall
[01:29] in prioritization and if you listen to the end we actually throw in a bonus topic. I really appreciate
[01:35] that Shreyas made the time for our chat and I cannot wait for you to hear it.

[04:04] Shreyas, the man, the myth, the legend, thank you so much for joining me and for having this
[04:10] conversation. It's great to be here Lenny. So we strategized about how to make this podcast as
[04:17] concretely useful and actionable for as many people as possible and so we decided to do is instead of a
[04:23] regular interview where we talk about a lot of stuff, instead we're gonna go deep on five
[04:28] of your ideas, teachings, lessons that you've shared on Twitter that have stuck with me and I
[04:34] know have resonated with a lot of other people and we're gonna call it the five big ideas from
[04:39] Shreyas Doshi. Does that sound about right? Sounds great. Okay, cool. So before we get into that,
[04:46] before we get into the meat of all this stuff, you share a lot of wisdom on Twitter but you don't
[04:52] share a ton of about yourself and your kind of background where you grew up, where you're born,
[04:58] things like that. So I'd love to learn a little bit more about the human that is Shreyas and so
[05:03] maybe you start there like where were you born, where'd you grow up, what'd your parents do for
[05:06] work or what did you want to be when you grew up? So I was born in Mumbai, Bombay, India and I lived
[05:15] there for the first 21 years of my life. I actually did not really even get to see many parts of India
[05:24] while I grew up in India and basically just was in Mumbai the whole time and then I moved here
[05:33] to the United States for graduate studies at age 21. My parents, my father was a businessman and so
[05:44] he started his own business. He manufactured spices and marketed them. So growing up I saw him
[05:52] work on packaging and pricing and I used to, when he was short on staff, I used to be
[06:00] packaging the spices into the little box or creating some marketing material for him,
[06:06] not the creative part but the grunt work. So I kind of grew up in that environment where
[06:11] the lines between what was my dad's business and our personal lives were very blurred. My mother,
[06:18] you know, just growing up was a homemaker and so my dad was largely kind of just busy and all consumed
[06:25] in his business and I ended up spending a lot of time growing up with my mother and so both of them
[06:32] have had a pretty significant influence in different ways but both significant influence
[06:37] on who I am. What I wanted to be when I grew up, I changed that a lot. When I was very young,
[06:44] one of my uncle is a doctor so I kind of saw him and I was like, oh maybe I should be a doctor
[06:50] and at some point later I changed that in high school. I took French and I ended up being
[06:57] really good at it, like surprisingly good at it and I was very passionate about it. So for a while I
[07:03] was thinking, oh maybe I'll be, like maybe teach French after I graduate from college, maybe I'll
[07:11] go to France, learn the language a little more and maybe I'll teach French. That lasted for a few
[07:16] years and it turned out that I ended up not pursuing that and instead got a degree in computer
[07:25] engineering. Partly I think because if you were in India back then, if you were good at science and
[07:31] mathematics, you would usually take up engineering and so that's what I ended up doing. I was also
[07:38] quite passionate about computers so maybe that was part of it but once I started on that path,
[07:43] it became much clearer what I wanted to do. How's your French these days?
[07:48] Very bad. Sad to say my son is now taking French and I am just embarrassed at my inability to
[07:56] assist him in any way other than to point out some conjugation errors. So you said you studied
[08:03] computer engineering, that's kind of what you moved to the US for. How did you move from that to
[08:08] product? Oh yeah, so I started my career as an engineer, all well backtracking. So I completed my
[08:14] undergrad in India, came here to the United States to pursue a PhD in computer science.
[08:21] About one month in, I realized that PhD in academia wasn't for me so I decided that I was
[08:30] going to drop out of the PhD program and once I dropped out, this was like 2001, 2002 so the
[08:36] climate was very different. There were basically no jobs for tech people, certainly there were no
[08:42] jobs for people who required a visa which I did. So it was very difficult but I ended up working
[08:47] as an engineer at a couple of startups and that started my career in tech. I was an engineer for
[08:56] about four or five years and when I moved here to the San Francisco Bay area, I got a little taste
[09:04] of product management. So I was part of this team that used to be LoudCloud and they were acquired
[09:09] by a larger company, EDS at the time. So it was a startup team within a larger organization
[09:15] and I was an engineer there and I just started doing some product work and I found that my managers
[09:21] over the time would kind of send me to customer meetings if we had an internal product. So these
[09:26] were internal customers and I thought it was a little surprising because I was fairly junior and
[09:31] I was an engineer but I was like okay, I'll just go to the customer meetings and I really enjoyed
[09:36] that. I really enjoyed understanding what our customers were trying to do and kind of helping
[09:42] them out. I also enjoyed thinking about creative ways to solve their needs and whatnot. So that
[09:47] was my taste of product management. I was in for a year, for about a year, I was kind of doing the
[09:52] product job without having the title and I was also the engineer so I was in this great state where
[09:58] I'd figured out what needed to be built and I would just build it myself and so that's how I
[10:03] started and at some point during that one year I realized that while I was a good engineer, I was
[10:09] perhaps a top 20% engineer. I realized that I would never be a great engineer, that I would never be a
[10:19] top 10% engineer because I saw those engineers at the fortune of working with them and I just
[10:25] could tell that I couldn't be that and I increasingly got interested in this product thing so I said okay,
[10:31] let's try out this product thing and so that's really what started my product career and I think
[10:37] what I have to be really thankful and grateful for there is the people who gave me a chance
[10:43] to do the product work and there were many people involved and so I think without their support,
[10:48] it would have been much harder for me to become a product manager.
[10:52] I didn't know that you moved from engineering to product and your journey is very similar to mine
[10:57] where I was also an engineer and once I got to Airbnb I was like okay, I am not good and I will
[11:04] not last as an engineer at a company like this and I should think about what other options exist
[11:09] and it worked out great and so that's I wonder how often that happens of PMs moving into PM
[11:14] because they aren't going to make it as an engineer. Yeah, I think it might be a common
[11:20] occurrence because you know, engineering is a really great job and like particularly on
[11:27] Empower teams as an engineer you can do a lot, you don't have to just like quote right code
[11:33] but you can do a lot and so I also think it's a great place for people to start their career if
[11:39] they have a technical background and if they enjoy the part about building software because
[11:47] sometimes people will ask me like hey, I'm doing this technical degree whether it's computer
[11:51] science or something else but I want my first job to be product management and I often respond with
[11:59] well try out engineering because in again in many companies fortunately these days
[12:04] you can do a lot more than just you know the core engineering job and so you get exposure
[12:11] to many different things and once you do that you can decide what path to pick.
[12:16] It's such a bonus to have that background as a PM. I wanted to go back to some of you
[12:20] mentioned that you worked at LoudCloud, I had no idea that was Mark Andreessen's second company,
[12:25] right? Yes, I joined that team, I was interviewing with them for again this was a time when like
[12:31] there were very scarce jobs in the valley and I was interviewing with them for nine months
[12:37] or something like that and they had just been acquired by EDS so they split into two companies,
[12:43] one got acquired by EDS and the other became Opsware which was the product company and so I
[12:49] joined the LoudCloud part of that organization. Got it, is there something that you took away from
[12:55] that company? Like was Mark Andreessen still working there and I think Ben Horowitz also?
[13:00] Yeah, they were still there, they were working on the Opsware side, it turned out again because
[13:04] even though I was hired as an engineer the first task I was given, the non-engineer task I was given,
[13:09] was to manage a relationship with Opsware because the way that split worked is EDS would use Opsware's
[13:19] data center automation technology and my team was responsible for deploying and supporting that
[13:25] technology for EDS and so I was given this role of managing the vendor relationship and I have no
[13:32] idea, I mean my early 20s I have no idea how to manage vendor relationships but I ended up doing
[13:38] that and as part of that I got an opportunity to work with many folks over at Opsware including
[13:44] folks on the leadership team there and I think I was most struck, that was my first experience
[13:51] of what a really highly talented and energetic team looks like. Both on the Opsware side,
[13:58] like I said I worked with a number of people there but also on the sort of former LoudCloud side
[14:04] who were my team members and that magic of you know a very high caliber team, people who were
[14:12] really great at their job and brought a high degree of energy and collaboration to their work,
[14:18] I was just lucky to have been part of that team early on.
