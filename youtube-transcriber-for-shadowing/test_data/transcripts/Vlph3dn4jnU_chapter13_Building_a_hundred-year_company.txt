============================================================

[00:00] Okay. So let's talk about this a little bit more. So this aim-heavy concept, this idea of
[00:05] thinking 100 years out. Can you just share more about just that insight and that philosophy? I
[00:09] know it sounds like it comes from Toby of how he likes to think about the business.
[00:13] Totally. This is all Toby of really making sure Shopify is so oriented around
[00:18] we are here to build a 100-year company. And so the decisions we're going to make
[00:22] are really oriented towards the long-term success of merchants, of Shopify embedded in all of our
[00:31] principles are make the best product in the world, make money to do more of one, never reverse
[00:37] principles two and three, never kind of executive meeting every town hall. That slide comes up.
[00:44] It's like you get a Shopify, you've probably seen that slide 10,000 times, but it's an important
[00:48] reminder like jobs to build the best product for merchants over the long period of time.
[00:54] And then all of the metrics and make money part of it secondary to that. So we care about that long
[01:00] term piece. It ties a little bit to that original conversation about entrepreneurs and being the
[01:07] core of why we just want more people to start businesses and go. It's very seductive I think
[01:14] in kind of most companies, including in Shopify, because we can support large enterprise businesses
[01:19] today, right? Big brands who want to get off an outdated solution and come over to Shopify.
[01:26] It's very easy to just say, oh, that's very concrete. There's an existing business.
[01:31] We want to have them come join Shopify. And in a short term, it feels really good because it
[01:37] brings a lot of revenue right away. But if you're thinking about the long term 100 years
[01:41] from now, guess what? All of the big brands of today will be out of business in many of them will
[01:47] be out of business in 30, 40, 50 years. The real success of Shopify is getting every
[01:53] business to start with us and go. But making that type of an investment and being so focused
[01:59] on that entrepreneur segment and making it easier is how we build kind of a very, very long term
[02:06] oriented company. So just even how we do capital investment, how we do product
[02:09] decision making comes back to, hey, we can't chase kind of the short term, even more concrete things.
[02:18] Is there an example that comes to mind where you did that, where something short term looked like,
[02:24] oh, we should definitely do this, but we're thinking long term, we're thinking 100 years out.
[02:28] So we're going to approach it this way. It's kind of very much just imbued in the culture.
[02:32] It's almost everything kind of feels that way. And I'll give like, practically speaking,
[02:37] every six weeks, we all the kind of R&D group leads, we get together and we sit with Toby and each
[02:44] other and review every single project across the company, every six weeks, every single R&D,
[02:49] both the dashboard and look at it. And in that conversation, so much of the conversation is
[02:57] about both the technical, how, how are we building this in a way that allows for Shopify
[03:05] to have optionality in the technical decisions that we are making. And I think for Toby,
[03:11] one of the things I've learned in his own is that the how, the technical architecture determines
[03:16] strategy in a technology company, even more than the kind of what and who we're building for.
[03:22] If you build the right kind of technical how and set yourself up to have a platform
[03:28] that can be adaptable, flexible, that is incredibly valuable over the long term,
[03:33] it means we will sometimes take longer to ship a feature. It means we will not chase
[03:39] kind of certain deals or what have you, but we're going to kind of make that at investment.
[03:43] And it comes through in all of our reviews and just how we got to do our work together.
[03:48] Wow, that is really unique. I've not heard of that where the how, usually it's the opposite.
[03:54] Let's not worry about how we're going to build this thing. It's why are we building this
[03:57] thing? And then when are we building it and not just like the architecture is the
[04:02] most important thing? Yeah, though. I mean, it's like in the last one, we had a, it was great.
[04:06] We had a 30 minute discussion about how to build CSD importers for people coming over
[04:13] from different platforms. And it was all about, are we using an open source library,
[04:17] doing it internally, are we doing it in the core code base, are we building a separate
[04:20] first party app to do it? It was incredible detail. And so what's amazing about Toby,
[04:25] the technical detail of how we're going to do this was incredibly important
[04:30] to get right, to kind of set up this type of structure. And most companies would be,
[04:33] okay, what, you're going to make it easier for people to migrate their data over. Cool.
[04:37] Team go figure out the how.
[04:41] And if team does forget how we work on it with kind of Toby and the details,
[04:44] because the how is so important to how we build for the future.
[04:49] That's fascinating. And usually it's, how do we do this as quick as possible?
[04:52] Because CVS importing is not our core differentiator. Let's just build
[04:55] something good enough, we'll ship it, we'll move on.
[04:57] Totally.
[04:57] To the opposite. That is fascinating.
[05:00] What's also really interesting about this is I think about Brian Chesky at Airbnb,
[05:03] where I worked for a while and his, so one, he also had this idea of the 100-year vision and
[05:08] thinking for the future way out in 100 years. But interestingly, since he's a designer,
[05:14] he had a very different focus. So Toby, he was an engineer, he still codes
[05:18] for what I can see on Twitter, still building things.
[05:19] Absolutely.
[05:21] So I could see why his brain goes there and why he's really strong in the how.
[05:25] Brian, on the other hand, is very focused on the experience and making sure the design is
[05:30] amazing and the app is exactly what he wants it to feel like. It's very like experience oriented.
[05:36] So it's interesting that founders, these founders lean into the thing that they're
[05:40] strong at and understand deeply and that ideally connects with the way this business
[05:46] specifically wins and grows. And it makes sense, a platform, I could see why engineering
[05:51] would be so essential to get right, travel, hospitality, consumer app, I could see why design
[05:56] is so important.
[05:57] 100%.
