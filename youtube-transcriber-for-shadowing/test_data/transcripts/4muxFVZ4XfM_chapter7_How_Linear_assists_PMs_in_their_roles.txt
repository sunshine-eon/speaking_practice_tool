============================================================

[00:00] Four teams that want to try the sort of approach, especially startups that are kind of starting
[00:04] out and maybe not excited about hiring product managers. Is there anything else that you think
[00:09] is essential or important to functioning well without any product managers? And you're at around
[00:14] 50 people at this point? Yeah, we are around 15. Probably the only thing I would say it's like
[00:20] the hiring front that like you really need to spend more time on it. And like basically you
[00:24] cannot really interview engineers only for the engineering skills, you also have to interview
[00:29] them for like the product skills. And it's like it's obvious like you cannot I think expect that
[00:33] people have some like if you do some kind of BM interview for them, it's not they're not going to
[00:38] have the same kind of skill set or the same understanding of the concepts or something.
[00:43] But like the way we've done it in the past is like basically I might interview them about the
[00:48] product. I'm not a technical person per se. So I will just like ask them questions about like
[00:53] how did they do something or like how do they think about something. And it's similar to other
[00:57] roles too. There's like we just look for like, do this person have like opinions about products
[01:02] and how they work and like can they form opinions and can they kind of use their own judgment at
[01:08] times? And then like can they communicate or articulate those things as well? Awesome. I was
[01:14] just thinking it's interesting that a tool that I don't think is designed specifically for
[01:18] product managers, but essentially for building products like the infrastructure for building
[01:22] product in a team is built by a company that has one BM and very few PMs. Yeah, I mean I think like
[01:28] in some ways I would say that like with linear we're trying to help the whole company and like
[01:32] I think engineers is probably like the largest user user group of the of the product. And like
[01:38] I think in some ways we want to make the the BMs drop easier or like that like they have to
[01:43] spend less time like managing everything or like the like the day to day. Because like the
[01:49] engineers are actually using the product and they're like updating the things. It's like for the
[01:53] BMs it would be much more easier to like get this like what is the state of things and and like
[01:58] maybe trust that much more because people actually use the product. So in some ways like I think we
[02:03] we're trying to like kind of like make it easier for everyone easier for the engineers like they
[02:08] they can focus more on their work. And then for BMs I think like we're trying to make it
[02:12] so that that they can also focus on more on other things than it's like I don't know
[02:16] managing the tool that they use. Like I think that's not the most important
[02:20] job of a PM. I think they should be like thinking more of the I don't know bigger picture or like
[02:25] other problems or like figure out like the next like features or
