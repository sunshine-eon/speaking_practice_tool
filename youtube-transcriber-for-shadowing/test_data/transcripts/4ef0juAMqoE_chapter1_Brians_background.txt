Chapter 1: Brian’s background
Video: Brian Chesky’s new playbook
Time: 00:00 - 05:18
============================================================

[00:00] way too many founders apologize for how they want to run the company.
[00:04] They find some midpoint between how they want to run a company and how the
[00:08] people they lead want to run the company.
[00:11] That's a good way to make everyone miserable because what everyone really
[00:14] wants is clarity.
[00:15] What everyone really wants is to be able to row in the same direction really quickly.
[00:19] And so I basically got involved in every single detail.
[00:22] And I basically told leaders that leaders are in the details.
[00:26] And there's this negative term called micro management.
[00:29] I think there's a difference between micro management, which is like telling
[00:33] people exactly what to do and being in the details.
[00:36] Being the details is what every responsible company's board does to the CEO.
[00:41] It doesn't mean the board is telling them what to do.
[00:43] But if you don't know the details, how do you know people are doing a good job?
[00:47] People think that great leaders job is to like hire people and just empower them
[00:51] to do a good job.
[00:52] Well, how do you know they're doing a good job if you're not in the details?
[00:54] And so I made sure I was in the details and we really drove the product.
[00:59] Today, my guest is Brian Chesky.
[01:03] Brian is the CEO and co-founder of Airbnb, which he started in his
[01:07] apartment with his co-founders, Joe Nate, and has turned into an $80 billion
[01:11] global business with travelers and homes in 220 countries.
[01:15] I was very lucky to get to work with Brian for many years.
[01:19] And my sense is if you ask people who they consider the most inspiring
[01:23] tech or business leaders today, Brian would be right near the top of that list.
[01:27] In our conversation, Brian shares an in-depth explanation of what's
[01:31] happening with product management at Airbnb, which caused quite a stir in
[01:34] the product world when he talked about this previously.
[01:37] We also get deep into Brian's new approach of how he runs Airbnb, including
[01:41] shifting away from traditional growth channels like paid growth, and instead
[01:45] betting that if they just build the best possible product and tell people about it,
[01:49] growth will happen.
[01:50] Also how the product team now operates, including having just one single roadmap
[01:54] across the entire company, and Brian staying very close to every design and every feature.
[01:59] We also get a bit into his personal life, including how he finds balance and avoids
[02:03] burnout, how he continues to learn himself so that he can stay ahead of the
[02:07] business and its growth.
[02:08] This is a very special episode for me, and I'm thrilled to bring you Brian
[02:12] Chesky after a short word from our sponsors.
[02:17] This episode is brought to you by Sidebar.
[02:20] Are you looking to land your next big career move or start your own thing?
[02:24] One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career and something
[02:27] that worked really well for me a few years ago is to create a personal board of
[02:31] directors, a trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having,
[02:35] get career advice, and just kind of gut check how you're thinking about your
[02:39] work, your career and your life.
[02:41] This has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted
[02:45] group. With Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted, private,
[02:50] supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives
[02:54] and raw feedback. Everyone has their own zone of genius, so together we're better
[02:59] prepared to navigate professional pitfalls, leading to more responsibility,
[03:03] faster promotions and bigger impact. Guided by world-class programming and
[03:07] facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused tactical feedback at every step
[03:12] of your journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're likely already

[03:38] You fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day to day
[03:41] reality is a little different than you imagined. Instead of dreaming up big
[03:45] ideas, talking to customers and crafting a strategy, you're drowning in
[03:49] spreadsheets and roadmap updates, and you're spending your days basically
[03:53] putting out fires. A better way is possible. Introducing Jira Product

[05:00] Brian, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.
[05:04] Well, thank you for having me.
[05:05] Did you ever think when I left Airbnb, one, that I would have a podcast and two,
[05:09] that you'd be on my podcast?
[05:11] I had no idea you would become a podcast host and that you would have such
[05:15] accessible podcasts. But yeah, congrats on everything. It was awesome.
