============================================================

fast that say we're like, velocity is really important moving fast is really important to us. But I feel like ramp is different is very different from that where you it's actually incredibly, incredibly fast. And it's actually something you come back to again and again, this idea of how do we move faster? Can you just share an example too of what velocity actually looks like at ramp and and what the reality of that is? 

Yeah, so when I joined, we were about, you know, 10 ish folks about eight engineers. In three months, we built a competitor to Mx. Six months after that, we built a competitor to expensify, you know, both public and traded companies. We hit 100 million in annual revenue. I think we're under at that point 50 total in the R&D department, less than four engineers and three PMs. And then we started expanding into accounts payable. We basically gave a team, you know, goal of building a competitor to build.com. It was three engineers, one designer, one PM, three months. And they hit it out of the park. That product is moving in billions of dollars a year. 

And I think, you know, the recipe for all this is constantly, you know, small teams have a single threaded focus. Give them the resources they need to execute big lofty goals, very tight timelines, and then like shield them from the chaos that is the rest of the organization. So basically, don't bother them and don't even tell the rest of the company that you're doing these things until they find product market fit until they actually find that early traction and then they can bring in more resources to sort of like gravity, right? And you let gravitational pull to this thing. 

Okay, I want to double click on some of these points you just made. So what you find is important to help teams and people move fast within ramp is you talked about single threaded teams shielding them from other people trying to pull them in different directions, lofty goals. There's a couple more things. Let's talk about the single threaded piece a little bit. What is that? What does actually mean? What does that look like? 

There are very few people who are able to execute extremely well and more than one thing. And it's especially true for individual contributors. And so what I mean by single threaded is like, there's only one goal, one thread that they're waking up in the morning to focus on. In order to remove that, you basically need to remove anything else that they're being asked to do to just focus on that thing, whether it's, you know, any type of research, any type of production engineering, or any type of process that's outside of that single goal. And you know, it almost goes as far as like you just like saving a room in the office just for them. They are just in that room all day, every day, just working on that one thing. 

What's an example that either some maybe someone's working on an hour in the past that's like a good example of a single threaded goal or team? Yeah, so for example, we launched a flex product over the last summer, that was a single threaded team, just focused on e-commerce companies and their needs with more cash flow conversion and cash flow smoothing. And so we kept that team, again, just purely focused on just shipping that product and hitting that goal. If they were ever distracted by something else, I don't think we would have hit it. 

How do you as a leader avoid distracting them knowing there's so many things you need to do? And there's constantly this like, oh, if we just fix this one bug, this one customer is going to be so happy. And okay, if I just asked this 1pm to work on this for a day, I know there's not going to be like, here's the rule, step 123. But how do you actually approach shielding teams from from things that just are constantly on fire? 

So we have, for example, on bugs or issues like that, we have individuals that are protecting those teams from those issues. So, you know, we have rotational program on production engineering, for example, where our engineers are protecting the core team from escalations from bugs from issues. We have product operators that are protecting the PM from the chaos that is, you know, documentation and escalations and release management and enablement customer requests. So we have layers of protective tissue to core teams. But I would say like, for any of these like big bets, you basically have to pull folks from different teams and reorganize a sub team. That team typically doesn't have responsibility on any existing product, because these are all fairly new products. 

I think it gets more challenging when you go from one to two, rather than zero one. You also mentioned this idea of lofty goals. And that's something I've seen a lot at Airbnb. There is a very known
