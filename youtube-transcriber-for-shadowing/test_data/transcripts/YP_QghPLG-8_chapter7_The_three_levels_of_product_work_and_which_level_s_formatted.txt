Something. Speaking of fears, our third big idea is around the three levels of product work. Basically, the three things that a PM should be focused on and how often, when you're not aligned on what is most important to you and your team, it often leads to conflict. I’m excited for you to unpack this idea of these three levels of product work, and I'll share what they are: impact, execution, and optics. Whenever I saw this for the first time, I always come back to these three things because it's so simple and so accurate. 

This idea that there are three levels of product work—impact, execution, and optics—once you understand it, explains a lot of what you see on product teams and organizations in general. Perhaps I’ll start with an example that most product people, product leaders, and founders are used to seeing. Imagine a product review where you, as a PM, are presenting to the CEO. As you're presenting what the plan is, obviously, since this is a real-world product, there are going to be some compromises that you're taking. 

The CEO might ask, “Okay, well, why is our customer service response time going to be so high in this case?” You’ve thought about it; it’s not like you didn’t consider that issue. There is a good reason why. You’ve talked to the VP of customer support, and they don’t have the funding this quarter to support your product fully, which will result in a poor customer service experience for this new product you’re launching. You’ve agreed to use your skills of influence to ensure that next quarter, they will allocate more people to your product so that the customer service experience will improve. 

However, when the CEO asks why the customer service experience is going to be poor, you reply with all these good reasons. Unfortunately, the rest of the product review doesn’t go as well as you hoped. After the product review, you find yourself wondering what happened. Maybe you ask your manager, “What went wrong?” You’re particularly curious about why the CEO couldn’t see your very rational argument about why you can’t do this at launch. 

The reason is that you are thinking at different levels. You, as a PM, are perhaps fixated on the execution level, which focuses on what it takes to get something done, how to achieve it, and how to hit the next milestone. Those are the things we tend to think about when we are operating at the execution level. The CEO, on the other hand, is approaching it from the impact level, particularly in this case, considering the impact on the customer experience.
