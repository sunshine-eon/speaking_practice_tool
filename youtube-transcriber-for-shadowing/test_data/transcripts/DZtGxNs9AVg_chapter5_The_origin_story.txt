Chapter 5: The origin story
Video: Building Lovable: $10M ARR in 60 days with 15 people | Anton Osika (CEO and co-founder)

============================================================

[00:00] So, we talked about this, the scale you guys have hit at this point.
[00:03] I imagine it's far beyond 10 million ARR.
[00:06] Do you share that at this point or are you keeping that private?
[00:09] We don't anchor on the numbers, but I could probably do a 2x tweet about this quite soon,
[00:15] yes.
[00:16] Okay.
[00:17] So, it's far beyond 10 million ARR at this point.
[00:20] It's one of the fastest growing startups in history, the fastest growing startup
[00:23] in Europe.
[00:24] I want to zoom us back to the beginning.
[00:27] What is the origin story?
[00:28] How did it all begin?
[00:29] What was the journey to today?
[00:32] I think I was not impressed by what people were doing with the large language models when
[00:38] after, especially after, I was using them way back, but when ChatGPT came out, they were
[00:44] starting to get really good at taking a human instruction and spitting out code.
[00:48] And then people in my team, I was the CTO at a YC startup, they felt like, oh, Anton,
[00:57] you're exaggerating, this is not going to change anything in the coming years.
[01:00] So I wanted to prove a point and I created an open source tool called GPT Engineer, where
[01:09] you could write something like create a snake game and then it spits out a lot of code,
[01:13] a lot of different files and then opens the snake game.
[01:17] And then I tweeted a video about that and GPT Engineer is to date the most popular
[01:26] open source tool to showcase the ability for large language models to create applications.
[01:31] And it's like 50,000 GitHub stars and a dozen of academic references.
[01:39] And I know that I'll just add that GitHub shut you down because I thought it was some
[01:43] kind of attack, like how many stars you're getting, how many people are using it.
[01:47] Right.
[01:48] Yeah, so that came later.
[01:49] That's lovable.
[01:50] Okay.
[01:52] Lovable earlier was always creating new projects on GitHub when someone used lovable and we
[02:01] asked them, is it fine?
[02:03] How was the limits here?
[02:04] They said, are there no limits?
[02:05] But once we started creating 15,000 projects per day, so there were a lot of usage then
[02:13] some engineer when it was on call, maybe they woke up in the night and they saw
[02:19] their servers were taking too much load because of us.
[02:23] So then they shut down completely and we got this email that said, oh, you broke some kind
[02:28] of rules and we didn't know what was going on.
[02:31] That's similar to a story I heard when ChatGPT was originally being trained, Microsoft servers
[02:37] were blocked it because they thought it was some crawler and it was just actually
[02:41] like the very first version of ChatGPT being trained on data.
[02:45] Anyway, keep going.
[02:47] So I built this tool called the GPT engineer and I was thinking about, we're seeing the
[02:57] biggest change humanity will ever see, I think, where like before you had manual labor
[03:03] being taken over by machines, but now it's actually cognitive labor being done better
[03:08] than humans by machines.
[03:11] And what's the best way to have some kind of positive impact here?
[03:16] It's not to make engineers more productive, which there's a lot of companies using AI to
[03:20] make engineers more productive, Microsoft to build co-pilot and so on.
[03:24] But it is to enable those who have like such a hard time finding people who are good at
[03:31] creating software that's been their absolute bottleneck and let them take their ideas and
[03:37] their dreams into reality.
[03:38] So enabling more entrepreneurship and innovation by building the AI software engineer for anyone.
[03:45] And then I grabbed a previous colleague of mine who has also been a founder, Fabian.
[03:52] And I said, we should build something like GPT engineer, but it has to be for the people
[03:57] who don't write code.
[04:00] That's the source.
[04:01] Okay.
[04:02] And then that became lovable.
[04:03] There's like the shift from open source into a product that anyone can use but also
[04:07] pay for.
[04:08] Makes sense.
[04:09] Okay.
[04:10] So at that point, I saw that they started making a million dollars in ARR per week once
[04:16] you launched lovable.
[04:17] Is that true?
[04:18] Yeah.
[04:19] So we launched, so we actually called the first version of the product like GPT engineer
[04:25] app.
[04:26] And that was very different in some ways.
[04:30] And we launched that under a wait list.
[04:32] And so like, oh, yeah, we have this wait list and we got a lot of feedback and
[04:35] iterated.
[04:36] And finally, when we thought the product was really good, we said, okay, now we
[04:40] have a lovable product.
[04:42] And it was mainly on the AI that we did a lot of improvements.
[04:47] Once we launched that, that was 21st of November.
[04:49] So that's almost three months ago.
[04:51] We just hit like one million ARR in a week.
[04:55] And then it kept growing at that pace.
[04:57] It's still growing at even faster than that pace.
[05:01] Faster than one million ARR per week.
[05:04] Holy shit.
[05:05] Okay.
[05:06] That sounds like product market fit to me.
