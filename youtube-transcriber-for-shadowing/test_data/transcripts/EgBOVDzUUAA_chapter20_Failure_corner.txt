============================================================

[00:00] gone. Probably the last question, is there a story of failure in your career that would
[00:06] be interesting to share something that taught you an important lesson?
[00:10] It's just series of failures. I think there is no escape for anybody who's done anything
[00:15] in life, not failed a lot like every day, every thing. But I would say that many initiatives,
[00:24] many products, companies that I've built have absolutely failed, hiring that have failed,
[00:32] trust broken, betrayals. So I think there is no end to it. But I think entrepreneurs have
[00:40] this weird ability to forget about failures and almost turn that into a lesson that you
[00:51] hold and you forget the story. And for example, COVID is literally no memory for me. I just
[00:58] don't remember what was COVID. It's just a blank in my head right now. And I think humans
[01:05] are great at forgetting the memory of failure, but remember the lesson from failure. But
[01:10] I think I'm constantly learning and I often believe that life is too short to make
[01:15] all our mistakes ourselves. So we should be learning from other people's failures
[01:18] as well. And a lot of times we don't do that because we believe that we are special. Nothing
[01:23] like that will happen to us. But as humans, we should be learning. I would say that my
[01:30] life started from a failure. My family went through severe financial crisis. I had to start
[01:36] working from age 15. And I feel till date, I'm just trying to escape that failure that
[01:44] happened in the family. So I think many of us are just fighting that initial large failure
[01:51] that we've had and don't want to be anywhere near that. And although we are significantly
[01:56] far away from that, but the feeling is exactly that circles back to whenever first few questions
[02:04] about the chips on shoulders and driving a lot of motivation, there's this phrase chips
[02:08] on shoulders drive chips in pockets. That's interesting. Yeah, is there anything more you
[02:15] want to share about that early challenge you went into? Or is that something you've shared often?
[02:20] No, I mean, I've shared that enough. But I just feel I should not talk about it before because
[02:25] I think that I would get some sympathy for that. And I only till like recent past I speak about
[02:31] it, because I want people to realize that I was not some gifted kid who had some
[02:36] rich parents who made me extraordinarily bright and put me in great school and colleges and I
[02:42] made my way through that. I should start talking about early because there's a lot of
[02:48] tendency to give sympathy to those people that, oh, this guy struggled and I don't want to be given
[02:54] any credit for playing that poverty card or this card or struggling for food card.
[03:03] That's not an excuse. There are so many people in the world who have done extraordinary well
[03:08] because they had the gift of struggle. And I often tell people that this is the biggest
[03:13] curse of successful parents, that that's the only gift they'll not be able to give to their kids
[03:17] the gift of struggle that they had. Well, I think about that a lot. We have a kid who's
[03:22] eight months now and so I'm trying to figure out the balance of struggle versus
[03:26] making life easy and great. A new challenge for me to figure out.
