============================================================

Anyway, I'm going to move on to a different topic, and this might become a new thing that we do. I'm going to call it Contrarian Corner. I asked you if you have contrarian opinions about things before we started recording this episode, and you had some really good ones. There are a couple of topics I'm going to chat about, and we'll see if this becomes a recurring theme. 

You're laughing and nodding your head—what are you thinking as I say this? I'm thinking about when I had a podcast. You would do a show on a topic, click the end recording button, and then every single guest would be like, "I had no idea what I was doing. I made it all up." It was waterfall; it was just like that. None of that matters. People would say the wildest stuff, and I would sit there as a PM and just think, "What? We just talked about this framework; we just talked about this thing, and that's how you're supposed to do it." 

Then they would get off the official part and just say, "Yeah, it's wild. Nothing goes the way you want it to go. We're all just kind of making it up as we go." I hope that you get more of those takes in this part of the show. I'm very sensitive to that point right now because someone just tweeted about how they're finding that many of my newsletter posts about how companies write product are like the ideal version of what they do. 

They rarely share, "Here are all the challenges we're having," which I think there's truth to that. But I also get into a lot of failures on this podcast. Actually, I think the podcast is a lot more about just like, "Here are things that go wrong," versus these letters. So I'm just like, "Shit, I need to do more."
