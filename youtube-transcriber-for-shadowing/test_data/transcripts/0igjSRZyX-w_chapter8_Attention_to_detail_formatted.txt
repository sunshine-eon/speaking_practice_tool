============================================================

I want to zoom out a little bit and there's a couple themes that came up again and again when I talked to folks that you've worked with, investors and Superhuman. The two themes are contrarian thinking in terms of building the company and strong attention to detail. Let's spend a little time on attention to detail. Like I said, this is one of the things that came up again and again when I was asking people about you.

So I have this quote from Ed Sims. And maybe your first investor, were they your first investor? Yeah, there's a bunch of people on Twitter who are going to fight for that. But to correct what's straight, Ed Sim did actually write the first three checks into Superhuman. First three checks, like subsequent rounds. Well, yeah, I mean, quick sidebar on that. He runs both Startups and Bench alongside his partner, Elliot Durbin. They have a particular interest in backing second-time founders, but they'll also back first-time founders and they love application and infrastructure areas like Superhuman. So we were like the perfect investment.

He also wrote a check from his previous fund into Reportive. I think I'd made him like five times that money. I'm nothing to write home about, but definitely I'm going to back this guy again. Right. So I went to him and I said, "Hey, listen, I think this is going to sound crazy. I want to take on Gmail." He said, "Do you have a deck?" I was like, "Yeah, here it is, one slide. Here it is." And it was a screenshot of Gmail with most of it scribbled out. I want to build that. It was going to be amazing. So he said, "Cool, we're in. Can I wire you the money?" And I said, "No, I don't even have a bank account yet." I came back two days later with a bank account. He's like, "Cool, I want to wire you 750 K." I said, "I don't even know what I'm going to do with that money. I'm not paying myself. I won't for a while. We don't have any employees. I can't think of anything I want to spend it on. Tell you what, I'll just take 250 K." He was like, "What? No, yeah, I'll just take 250 K." 

We start having the conversation around venture economics. I'm like, "Yeah, you know, it's fine. We'll figure it out." A few months back, I took another 250 K. A few months back, I took another 250 K as I began inventing ways and finding channels to deploy capital properly. I love the story. I love all these stories you're sharing. I've never heard before. And by the way, it is awesome. We're talking about him coming on the podcast, maybe breaking our VC rule.

Specifically, the story he shared with me is maybe an example of you and your attention to detail. He said that you created your own font because existing fonts weren't good enough. Is that true? Kind of. The font that we use today is a modified version of Adele Sans. The story there is I looked at all of the major font families, and honestly, none of them was what I would call truly excellent. That may sound like an odd thing to say. So let's, if you will, permit me to talk about typography and email.

The first thing we did was we took our UI and we laid it out in about 15 different styles using examples of the major font families. We actually printed these out and left them on a desk in the middle of our office. Sometimes with design, you want to tune in to your immediate, most visceral response, but sometimes you want to truly let a design marinate. This was the latter. So we let these designs marinate. We let these font choices percolate. And like I said, none of them was truly excellent.

The number one thing I was looking for was a font that was in and of itself gorgeous. Number two, I was looking for a font that could also convey a message of any kind without overpowering the sentiment of that message. For example, does the font work when it's inviting you to a party? Many fonts, including almost all serif fonts, are actually too somber or too sober for that. Or to pick another extreme, does the font work if it is informing you of somebody's passing? Many fonts are just too jaunty for that. You wouldn't want that kind of message in Comic Sans, for example.

Number three, I was optimizing for a font that made reading speed and comprehension really fast. Before I was looking for fonts that made email addresses themselves look great. So I discarded all the 15 because they weren't good enough. After searching high and low, I came across a font called Adele Sans, which is designed by a foundry called Type Together. They have a whole bunch of lovely fonts; go check them out. 

If you go through my list, number one, Adele Sans is gorgeous. I think each character is a work of art. It's beautifully formed. Number two, Adele Sans is, I would say, a beat. It's optimistic, yet it's serious enough to convey any kind of message. It has just the right amount of personality, yet not too much personality. Number three, Adele Sans is also unusually narrow, and that actually fits email particularly well. One of my pet peeves with email, which by default uses Arial, is that the lines are as wide as your window. So if you're in a wide screen, then the lines get really arbitrarily long.

The problem with really wide and really long lines is that they decrease reading speed because by the time you've reached the end of one line, your eyes have lost track of the start of the next line. Arial itself has fairly wide characters, which further exacerbates that. So at Superhuman, if you've used the product, you know this, we fix the line length or the typographical measure to the optimal length for reading speed, which depending on the font is around 90 to 120 characters. Adele Sans is quite narrow, so it actually lets us do this on quite small windows with fairly dense lines. 

We get a lot of information on fairly small windows without getting a very long typographical measure, optimizing for reading speed and comprehension. Finally, Adele Sans has a very unusual treatment of the at symbol in an email address. It actually puts the base of the A in the at on the same baseline as the rest of the text. For example, if your name has an A, my name does, Rahul at Vora's three A's and or two A's and an at, they're all actually on the same baseline. It's a small thing, but it makes the email addresses look incredibly natural. 

If you look at that and then you actually look at email addresses laid out in other fonts, those fonts look really clunky and awkward because the A is kind of shifted around, and it just looks a bit silly in my opinion. Now Adele Sans is perfect. We then worked with a type designer on some of the specific details that there are some of the glyphs, which get a little pincery as it were. What we use today is very close to retail Adele Sans. 

This was pre-launch or this was after you already launched? We'd probably had about 10 to 15 users at that point. I think that's pretty contrarian, unique to be this focused on the font and the typeface before you even launched. This was like, is this even going to be a thing? Will anyone even care? I think this says a lot about the way you think about product. 

Oh, yeah, that thought never crossed my mind. I think we'll probably come to it later. But the idea that is this never going to be a thing, I think that's a dangerous thought. We can't start thinking that way. Because at what point do you stop second guessing yourself? Interesting. So you're like, you were confident this was going to work. Because I am so confident it'll work, I will make, I need to get this right. 

There's also just, you know, this trap founders fall into of just spending too much time perfecting a thing that never works. There's always advice, launch early, launch often. Well, thoughts there, just like, how do you find that balance? What's your advice there? How much to spend time ahead of launch really does depend on the markets and the structure, the nature of your business model. 

For example, let's say you're building a marketplace in a greenfield opportunity. Imagine Lyft or Uber in their heyday. There's a strong network effect because the more cars you have on your platform, the shorter waiting times are for people who are going to preferentially use your app versus the other person's app. That's when there's no time to spare. You probably shouldn't even be sleeping. You're going to hire the most aggressive, maniacal people possible. You're going to work 120-hour weeks because every marginal minute actually does matter. 

Every marginal minute in the market, growing compounding is going to make your next year even better. That's actually not true of all startups, and it certainly isn't true of something like Superhuman. Yes, working harder is always better, and we work tremendously hard at Superhuman, but not to the point where it made sense to release something that didn't work. 

I'm reminded of a story of a founder that was in Y Combinator who told me about their demo day experience. They used Mailbox, which some folks may remember was also a startup, and Dropbox famously acquired them for about a hundred million dollars. The reason that they were well known apart from the acquisition is they were the first to popularize swipe to archive or swipe to mark done, which of course is now standard in Superhuman and every other app. 

This founder was using Mailbox and was having an amazing demo day. They were working the room, meeting investors, pitching the photography app in this case. He went home that night, fired up Mailbox, and sent off a bunch of follow-up emails. He waited a day. Didn't hear back. He waited two days. Didn't hear back. On the third morning, he figured something was up. So he fired up Gmail, went to his sent mail, and you guessed it, there were no sent mails there. 

Something had broken with Mailbox. So he's cursing to himself, trying to remind himself everything's going to be okay, sent all the same emails from Gmail manually. They all came through. But then one of the investors said, "Hey, by the way, you might want to check your email client because I've been getting some of your emails twice." He goes back and says Gmail. He sees that, yes, actually the original emails that were queued up in Mailbox have now indeed been sent. 

Some of the investors, unfortunately, most of the investors, he actually pitched twice. Now, is this the end of the world? No, an investor can overlook that. Probably a good thing that you're trying new apps. But was it horrifying? And was it really scary? Absolutely. Imagine this wasn't investors. Imagine this was a customer, someone who you were trying to convince to buy your thing and that you knew what you were doing and you had attention to detail and you had everything just buttoned up and under control. 

Well, now you've lost face. Now you look foolish. That's why when you have a mission-critical product like email, where you are interfacing with customers, with candidates, with investors, it turns out to really matter. Email is mission critical. So it's not something where you can simply launch with a half-baked product. 

This is such an important nuanced take on. There's always this debate, how much to focus on craft and use your experience, how much to focus on time to launch and get it out and speed. What I'm hearing here, which I completely agree with, is that it depends on the criticality essentially of your product. So if it's email, it just needs to work.
