[00:00] Okay. One last question, totally different topic. Discounting. So you worked at Udemy
[00:07] for a long time. And from what I understand, discounting was one of the key reasons Udemy
[00:13] succeeded and one of the big differentiators. I'm curious what you learned about discounting,
[00:18] the power of discounting as a growth lever.
[00:20] Yeah. So Udemy is a very, this is an online marketplace for online courses. So come
[00:28] on, of course. And I think what was happening in, you know, I started it over there, 2012-ish,
[00:33] was people were, what is this online course thing? I don't really understand what it is.
[00:38] I don't understand what the value is and what I'm willing to pay. And so what discounting
[00:43] is a really powerful effect on is it can signal value with a high list price, but then
[00:49] bring something down to an affordable price. And that may seem like, of course, that's
[00:53] obvious, but in online courses, what was important is the list price would be high.
[00:58] At $100, it was associated with like a college course. But what people really value this thing
[01:03] as was a book. And so you could signal very high signal quality through price, which was
[01:09] very murky at that point in online learning, signal value through price, discount it to
[01:15] $10 or that was the typical Udemy deal. And then, so 99% off, 90% off, we might
[01:22] see like fire sales, but it changed the value and willingness to pay. And then it tapped into
[01:29] the fact that, and still is, education is very aspirational. And so what a lot of people
[01:35] missed in that, in education is, yes, we want people to actually take the course.
[01:41] But that's actually, in many cases, not the job to be done, that there's an emotional
[01:45] job that's even more important, which is I'm feeling like I'm making progress in
[01:50] my educational journey. And just the act of purchasing a course or the act of buying a
[01:55] book is progress. And so if you can make it very enticing, very high value thing, cheap
[02:03] urgency, you can let people make that emotional journey by the act of purchasing, which
[02:10] didn't allow us to actually have very good retention, because you could keep coming
[02:14] back to that emotional job over and over again, which just kind of with urgency
[02:19] allowed us to.
