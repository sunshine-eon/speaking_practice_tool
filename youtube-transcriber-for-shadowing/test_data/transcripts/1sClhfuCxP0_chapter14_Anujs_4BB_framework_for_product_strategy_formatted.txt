============================================================

That’s awesome. Okay, another framework that you have is something that you call the 4BB framework for product strategy. Can you talk about what that's all about? 

We essentially saw that, you know, if a startup actually wants to do a bunch of things across the board, there’s always like, “Hey, I should be investing in tech debt or building core platforms that would really help my product in the long term.” And that's super important. That's my engineering managers and largely people asking for that bandwidth. Then there is the product manager themselves, who’s basically saying, “I want to do feature enhancements, bug fixes, my version tools, a few areas, experiments, and so on and so forth.” That’s a regular product backlog that they would work on sprint by sprint. 

And then there’s leadership which will say, “You know what? Now we have a suite of products. Now I want to take a large delta bet that may work, it may not work. But we need to make sure that it works.” But I need work across teams, and it’s not only one person that needs to do it. Any contribution from four or five of you that come together and deliver that. Or there are places where a company is reimagining their identity or they’re pivoting, which is like, “Alright, we were doing X. Now we are doing X plus Y. That’s how we want to be known.” Or we were doing X, and now we want to do very little effects because current consumers, okay, we will take care of them. But now we want to pivot into Y. 

So it usually falls into these four buckets. What really happens is it gets down to product managers eventually prioritizing between these four. I don’t think it’s a tactical prioritization product manager call. It really is a product strategy call. The conversation that needs to happen is between, say, the head of product and the CEO, or even like the leadership. If I gave you 100 focus points, how much will you put in each of these buckets? 

So what are those four buckets? We call them the first BBs: brilliant basics. The reason why we call it BB, brilliant basics, is because you need to brand it; you cannot brand it as tech debt. So it feels very awesome. Because these are brilliant; these are important. That’s what the company is built on, and the company needs to invest in that. 

The second one is bread and butter. That’s your backlog. So if the product managers had no big ideas and they just were left on their own, what would they come up with in terms of just improving that line of business that they’re given? Then there are big bets. That’s where your larger ideas come together. But how many big bets should we take? Or is this big bet even a big one? That’s where your working backwards of PRFQs starts becoming even more important. Because those are the kind of bets that cannot be taken without everybody basically signing up, working backwards, and saying, “We will all make this successful.” 

And making bad essentially is a different world altogether. That’s where you want to redefine your company. For example, in Sweden, we were doing food delivery. Now we wanted grocery delivery as well. It’s like these are two companies working together. Or from a food delivery company, we wanted to become a convenience company. That’s almost breaking bad. 

Again, like I said, we got cheesy. But the good thing that happens is now what you can do is, along with your leadership, take stock. The head of product essentially can say, “You know what? In the next year, I can invest a lot less in my brilliant basics, and we should as a company focus a lot on this breaking bad because that is existential.” But then we should not look back and say, “Why were tech systems a little bit broken this time? Why did we have a little bit more downtimes?” 

You can basically blow it out and almost showcase what to expect. For example, if we are just working on a whole bunch of bread and butters, you’re starting a lot fewer bugs, customers will be a little happier. You worked a lot more on brilliant basics; tech systems are nice, but you didn’t create any differentiators. Well, none of your bets went out, and your competitors are catching up. 

So does that sound like a better future? These are hard questions, and these prioritization questions, I don’t think they’re so much a product management question as a product strategy question. But in a lot of cases, executives don’t know what they’re trading off against. So if you are able to create the conversation around which buckets do we want to put in and create three alternatives, I’ve kind of tried to do that a bunch of times. 

Let’s look at strategy and see how to be divergent. If suppose we were putting a lot fewer focus points in brilliant basics and a lot more on, for example, big bets, then there will be a risk that we won’t have any experiments or very few experiments. Your bugs will stay bugs, but we will get a shot at kind of changing the game. Is that a future that sounds better, or something else, which is like, because you’re paying also by a lot of bugs and constant downtimes? 

So which is more secure? We won’t build something amazing, but which sounds better? Because you are able to drive that, now the clarity to the product managers is way clearer in terms of what they will do. They would also know that if they have been signed up for a big bet, then they will need to contribute to the PRFQ, they will need to contribute to the actual working of that, irrespective of what their product was, but now they’re part of something bigger. 

Awesome. I love it. Okay, so just to summarize so people can have a very short definition of this framework: Brilliant basics is essentially tech debt and things that just have to do with hygiene. Bread and butter is essentially optimizing the existing product. Big bets are big bets, and breaking bad are just like future big rocket moonshots that transform the way the business works. 

That’s right. I love it. It’s also interesting; another thread that comes up again and again in your advice is exploring all the options before committing to one. You always, I think, sound like you always try to recommend three. 

I guess let me say what I always find is important there is I think it’s important for the product manager to recommend one along with that. It’s not just like, “Here’s three. You tell me which one you do.” It’s like, “Here’s three. Here’s my recommendation.” 

Why is that your advice too, or do you see some? 

Hundred percent. So when you have explored the three, you essentially have that work covered. You’ve gone over all bases and also crystallized them into a concrete option. Now I’m choosing one on the company’s behalf based on whatever I know about the market, about the company, about our strategy, and about how we will make it successful. 

If I miss something, it’s also a time where you can actually work with leadership and other product managers to essentially get that knowledge complete. Or if you’re 80 percent right, you can actually use elements of strategy two and strategy three to bring into one. So that’s always the way that you have to think: one very concrete option, but because you have these other tools, you’re not missing anything and bringing it together. 

But ultimately, you’re the one who is going to champion this. That’s where the other leadership element of Amazon comes in, which is disagree and commit. So once we have aligned on this one, we’ll all commit to launching this, and then the leadership should not go back and forth on that part.
