============================================================

[00:00] Kari, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.
[00:04] Thanks, Lenny. It's great to be here.
[00:06] Maybe to start, set a little context. Can you just explain what does linear do?
[00:11] And then share maybe a few stats of just the scale of linear at this point.
[00:16] So, linear is the project and issue tracking system that software companies and technical teams love to use.
[00:22] We help like software companies to build software.
[00:25] We started 2019.
[00:28] Today, some of the top growth companies like Block, Versailles, Ramp, Retool, Mercury and Substack are building with linear.
[00:39] We also additionally have lots of other companies, like thousands of other companies using linear.
[00:45] These companies can be like very early stage team, like some companies just graduated from YC or a public company.
[00:52] And just briefly why we created linear is that I work with you at the Airbnb and before that I work at Coinbase.
[01:02] And before that I had my own startup and all of us founders, there's three of us.
[01:07] We had a similar base where we worked in multiple different companies in different stages.
[01:13] And what we saw often is that the tools available for managing software projects burned that, like really cutting it.
[01:22] I think a lot of them felt very conky or complex or just like they had this kind of legacy way of thinking about software development.
[01:31] And so we just felt like we should do something about it.
[01:35] So with linear we set out to do like build this like most frictionless and streamlined system for modern software development.
[01:45] I'm also happy to share that we've been profitable the last two years.
[01:50] And we also have this thing where we actually have this net negative lifetime burn rate,
[01:56] which means that we just have more cash in the bank today than we have raised.
[02:01] I think a lot of startups like usually the normal ways is that like you raise money and then you need to spend it to build it.
[02:08] But I think we since we were able to build the business pretty early on,
[02:12] we've been able to be in this position that actually we haven't spent any money on building the business.
