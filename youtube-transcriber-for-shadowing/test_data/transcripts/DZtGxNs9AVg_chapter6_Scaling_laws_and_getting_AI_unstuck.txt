============================================================

[00:00] You said that you did a lot of work on the back end.
[00:02] I saw you tweet about this,
[00:03] that you guys figured out some kind of unlock
[00:06] on scalability like a new scaling law
[00:08] that allowed you to build something like this.
[00:11] What can you talk about there
[00:12] that kind of on the technical element
[00:14] allowed you to build something new and the successful?
[00:18] There are many scaling laws, I would say,
[00:19] when you build AI systems.
[00:21] And this one in particular is about
[00:23] when you put in more work,
[00:25] the product reliably gets better and better.
[00:29] And what you've seen generally
[00:33] when you have AI building something
[00:35] is that it kind of gets stuck in some place.
[00:37] It starts, it's super good in the beginning
[00:40] and then it gets stuck.
[00:42] What we did was to painstakingly identify places
[00:45] where it goes stuck and there's different approaches
[00:50] but address like different ways how we do it
[00:53] but address the places where it gets stuck.
[00:55] Tune the entire system quantitatively
[00:59] and having a very fast feedback loop
[01:01] to improve it in the areas where it got stuck.
[01:04] The most important areas.
[01:05] It still does get stuck sometimes
[01:06] but that's the scaling law
[01:08] and we're still early in that scaling law, I would say.
[01:14] And so when you talk about things getting stuck
[01:16] it's like the AI agent just saying
[01:18] like I don't know what to do from this point
[01:20] and or like they introduce some kind of bug
[01:21] is that an example of getting stuck?
[01:23] It introduces some kind of bug
[01:25] and then it's not smart enough to figure out
[01:28] how to get out of that bug.
[01:30] I see and this is a common problem people have
[01:34] with tools like this is they like get to a certain point
[01:36] and then it's like, well, I don't know what to do
[01:38] I'm not an engineer.
[01:39] Like here's a bug it's running into
[01:41] where the infrastructure is built the wrong way.
[01:43] And so it sounds like one of the paths
[01:46] to solving that is what you're describing
[01:47] is you make the AI smarter to get,
[01:51] to void more and more of these places they get stuck.
[01:54] Another is people just learning how to get AI unstuck.
[02:00] This is something when we had Amjad on the podcast
[02:02] from Replete he said that this is like the main skill
[02:04] that he thinks people need to learn is how to unstuck AI
[02:08] when it runs into a problem.
[02:10] Just thoughts there.
[02:10] I don't know anything along those lines come up
[02:12] as they say that.
[02:13] This is something that is a problem today
[02:17] and the frontier of where this is a problem
[02:22] is very rapidly like receding back.
[02:25] So what we did was we identified the most important areas
[02:30] like, oh, so specifically adding login,
[02:33] creating data persistence, adding payment with Stripe.
[02:38] Like those are the things that we make sure
[02:40] it doesn't get stuck on, for example.
[02:43] And the places where it gets stuck today is currently
[02:47] something that where you can use being very good
[02:51] at understanding and getting unstuck,
[02:53] but in the future it won't be so important.
[02:55] This is just going to not get stuck.
[02:58] And I know you're not talking super in depth about this
[03:01] because this is one of your unfair advantages,
[03:02] this kind of stuff you figured out,
[03:03] so I'm not gonna push too far.
[03:05] I know you want not everyone to do exactly the same stuff.
[03:08] So I wanna zoom back to the pace of growth
[03:12] that you guys have seen.
[03:14] One of the big stories everyone's always looking at you
[03:15] guys have like 15 people, 10 million ARR in two months.
[03:20] It's absurd, I don't know if it's ever been done in history.
[03:24] If so, it's maybe a couple other AI startups recently.
[03:27] How have you been able to do this?
[03:29] What have you done that has allowed you
[03:31] to grow this fast with so few people?
[03:34] I'd like to take credit of having done everything
[03:38] end-to-end in the product,
[03:41] but what we're building on top of taking the oil here,
[03:46] which we have discovered oil,
[03:48] which are the foundation models, right?
[03:50] And then what we've done is that we obsessed about
[03:53] what's the right way to present this to a user,
[03:56] what's the interface for the human
[03:58] to get as much out of this as possible.
[04:00] Packaging together, I showed you in the demo
[04:04] that how you can add authentication
[04:06] and making this work seamlessly together as a whole.
[04:10] That's what we've done.
[04:11] And then people love the product.
[04:14] That's the driver of the growth.
[04:17] For getting awareness,
[04:21] we mainly been posting what we've shipped on social media.
[04:25] That's how people know about us.
[04:27] So building in public is how people usually describe that.
[04:30] So it's like, I think it's like,
[04:32] you guys have the advantage of the demos
[04:34] or just like, holy shit, you can do that.
[04:36] And then you guys share the numbers
[04:37] that you guys are growing at.
[04:38] So it's innately interesting and shareable.
[04:42] But I imagine most people have something interesting
[04:44] to share.
[04:45] I guess, is there anything that you think you did
[04:47] that other companies maybe haven't done
[04:49] that make the product so lovable?
[04:53] I mean, the team is everything in building a great product.
[04:57] So I just give a big shout out to D-Nut has written the code.
[05:03] I haven't written much of the code recently, I would say.
[05:08] And I mean, you want people who ship really fast
[05:13] and ship really fast and have good taste
[05:16] for like what is simple, what's the right abstractions.
[05:20] And I think that's what we've done differently.
[05:22] And I have this obsession
[05:24] for just making it better and better and better.
