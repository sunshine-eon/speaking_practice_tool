That you can get a decision very quickly. Are there any other really common frameworks or processes along these lines at LinkedIn that you find really helpful? 

The third thing is just in how we think about talent, especially in the product organization. I often really do try to suss out during interviews how we prevent people with just their ability to see systems. I do think it's a different skill set and a different capability of how we kind of map those things out in a complex group. 

Oftentimes, I think those talent systems will favor those who are able to see the whole and make decisions based on that whole. That's kind of rare, actually. Most talent systems focus on how did your division grow, your product grow, your error grow? 

We've tried our best to understand that it's not just about that. Of course, you want accountability in the ecosystem, but how well does this person work across different areas? We've created telemetry around that or an organizational understanding of it, recognizing that this skill set is really important here. I think that's quite rare in driving that kind of complex system as well.
