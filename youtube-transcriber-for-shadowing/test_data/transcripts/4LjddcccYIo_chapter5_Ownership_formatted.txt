The other thing is I think that there's just like a focus you need to get better at. People often want to lump together a bunch of ideas, and every time you do that, it just dilutes everything. So, I think there's a lot of power in picking the thing that's going to have the most impact and cutting other stuff that may have some value but is much less important. Simplification and prioritization, which are sort of the same thing, get tossed around a lot as skills you have to get good at, but it's really challenging.

The one thing you should do is extremely difficult. Having the gumption to say no to all those other things is really hard because, at any given time, there are probably ten things you should do. However, you can't do ten things; you'll never be successful if you try. So, you have to pick one. It’s about figuring out how to get confident in your decision and having the willingness to make the bet and be responsible for it. This willingness is what separates the PM role from many other roles and makes it such a challenging job when done right. You have to be willing to take responsibility; it's your job to pick the thing and be accountable to your team for that choice. So, you better get it right.

Ownership is such an important part of being a PM. Reflecting on an interview I just did with an ex-Amazon employee, one of their principles is ownership—feeling like you have ownership of what you're working on. I agree, but to me, at least, the word ownership doesn't carry the same weight as making a bet. When you make a bet, it means you know there's a chance that the thing you're working on might not work out, and you still have to be the one to jump off the ledge, to drop in on the ski run. Ownership, to me, never signaled that level of risk that comes with being a PM.

A good point on the simplify concept reminds me of Airbnb. One of the core values at Airbnb was to simplify, which reflects the idea that we should always try to simplify our processes. However, the founders realized they weren't actually great at this, and it was unfair to say this was a value when they weren't practicing it. So, they decided to cut it as a core value. Their feeling was that they shouldn't have aspirational values; they should reflect who they actually are. They even cut two different values to be clearer, even though they still want to simplify. They just acknowledged that they weren't actually good at it, so why pretend? 

I think maybe I'm good at simplification on paper, but there have been many times where I've found myself in situations where things are not simple, and you just have to keep pushing through.
