============================================================

[00:00] Oh, here's the other thing Lenny when you were there being be we had guest team and a host team
[00:04] We don't have a guest team and hosting. We have a design team. We have a marketing team. We have an engineering team
[00:10] The reason we don't
[00:11] break the app into guests and hosts anymore is because
[00:15] Reviews affect guests and hosts. It turns out that almost everything
[00:20] involves connecting the guests and hosts and you have separate teams
[00:23] They tend to have separate roadmaps that go in separate directions and become incompatible
[00:27] So we have product marketers that are responsible or guests and hosts things
[00:31] But there's the the designers are
[00:34] The engineers are fairly fungible and they can move from project to project
[00:38] And then we keep some people especially the product marketing people on a domain area
[00:42] But we really want to make sure that we have designers and engineers
[00:46] Covering a much larger surface and so so that's what we do
