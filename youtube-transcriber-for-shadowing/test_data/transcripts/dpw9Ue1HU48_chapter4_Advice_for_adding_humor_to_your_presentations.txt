============================================================

[00:00] Wow, I feel like I've just learned so much about you and how you think just from that question and how you approach this problem on
[00:06] This humor piece. I'm curious any lessons to share on how to be funny
[00:10] so one of the kind of tricks of the trade in humor and you learn this
[00:14] Particularly a stand-up comedy, but just any comedy and I just hadn't thought of it this way
[00:18] Is that and this is very tactical, but it works and it's a very easy thing to apply
[00:23] So let's say you're looking at and most of us in it in the
[00:26] You know, we're not stand-up comedians
[00:27] We're not gonna tell jokes in the classic sense, right? And even stand-up comedians don't tell jokes, right?
[00:31] They they actually have stories and they happen to have a punchliner punchliner to the two tactical pieces of advice
[00:38] One is when you're telling the story, whatever the funny bit is
[00:43] Those have to literally be the last words of that particular segment, right? So once you deliver it
[00:49] Then you have to stop talking and the reason you have to stop talking is the audience that needs about a half
[00:54] a second to react and then they want the permission to laugh and if you're continuing to say words
[01:00] It's gonna make them feel awkward and it's gonna be less funny
[01:03] So even if like moving a phrase in the sense that you're about to say it's like well
[01:08] That sounds kind of weird to put those set of words at the end of the thing
[01:11] Do it anyway, even though it's awkward because it will actually work better
[01:15] That's kind of tip number one tip number two on LPM generally is that
[01:20] Have a story such that you can kind of spend the time setting up the story
[01:24] But then have multiple funny bits multiple punchlines because you've already made the investment
[01:28] I've said 75 words in order to kind of set up this context
[01:32] Say something funny that's amusing that's so whatever say some more things you already have the content
[01:36] You'll see the stand-up comedians do this all the time and then say something else
[01:38] That's funny because you just because a laugh is a laugh doesn't really matter that it was still the same story
[01:43] So kind of leveraged the investment you've already made in establishing context and scene and then just squeeze more humor into the end of it
[01:51] Kind of punctuated fashion. I feel like the entire podcast could just be this one thread
[01:54] But I need to move on to other topics one quick question
[01:57] So you said ideal laughs for a minute is two to three ish. Is that what you said?
[02:01] Yeah, two plus is hard for a business talk, right? Because they have comedians the reason they can do it is
[02:08] That's all they're really kind of solving for is LPM
[02:11] In business talks you actually have another agenda other than just being entertaining, right?
[02:15] You actually have a message you're trying to promote something promote an idea promote a product
[02:18] So anyway, anything in my mind for
[02:22] For like most normal circumstances even if you can get above like a one one point two to five
[02:28] You're in the top-decile in terms of top generally given by non-professionals. Wow, this is incredible
[02:35] So after every talk you will listen you run this transcript and audio through your program to see how you did yet
[02:40] Yes, and are you ever going to publish and release this program because that sounds really cool
[02:44] I have this notion of what I call solo wear and solo wear is exactly what it sounds like it's software built for exactly one person
[02:51] In my case that one person is me and so I've been doing this
[02:55] Thing for like 30 years right now
[02:57] I just build things that I would myself find useful
[03:00] And the nice thing about so one of the many nice things about it is that you have the UI is only for one person
[03:06] You don't have to do a whole lot of testing because only needs to work for one person
[03:09] And the most important thing is that because it's only for one person if it stops bringing utility you can just turn it off
[03:15] You should stop using it versus if you have users even 10 users and you put it out there
[03:20] And then people would be disappointed if you took it down for whatever reason
[03:24] That's kind of hard. So anyway, so that's the capital that I go through is like is this
[03:29] Useful enough to enough people where it's worth the calories of kind of making it non-solo wear making it even
[03:34] Microware I just made that up. But yeah, so wow, okay
[03:37] Let's see how the YouTube comments react and how many people would want this and pay for it
